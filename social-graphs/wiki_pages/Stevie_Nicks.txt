Stephanie Lynn "Stevie" Nicks was born at [[Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix|Good Samaritan Hospital]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Arizona to Jess and Barbara Nicks. Nicks is of German, English, Welsh, and Irish ancestry.

Nicks's grandfather, Aaron Jess "A.J." Nicks Sr., taught Nicks to sing duets with him by the time she was four years old. Nicks's mother was protective, keeping her at home "more than most people" and fostered in her daughter a love of fairy tales.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/fleetwood-mac-they-dared-to-be-different-243618/ |title=Fleetwood Mac: They Dared To Be Different |date=February 7, 1980 |publisher=rollingstone.com |access-date=June 10, 2022 }}</ref>

As a toddler, Stephanie could only pronounce her name as "tee-dee", which led to her nickname of "Stevie".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inherownwords.com/family.htm |title=Stevie Nicks on her Family |publisher=inherownwords.com |access-date=June 1, 2010 |archive-date=August 8, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808180221/http://www.inherownwords.com/family.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

While living with Dashut, Buckingham landed a guitar role with the [[Everly Brothers]] 1972 tour. Nicks stayed behind working on songwriting herself.

In late 1974, Keith Olsen played the Buckingham Nicks track "Frozen Love" for drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]], who had come to [[Sound City Studios|Sound City]] in California in search of a recording studio. Fleetwood remembered Buckingham's guitar work when guitarist [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] departed to pursue a solo career. On December 31, 1974, Fleetwood called Buckingham, inviting him to join the band. Buckingham refused, insisting that Nicks and he were "a package deal" and that he would not join without her. The group decided that incorporating the pair would improve Fleetwood Mac. The first rehearsals confirmed this feeling, with the harmonies of the newcomers adding a pop accessibility to the band's former style of blues-based rock.

Becoming aware of her image as a performer, Nicks worked with clothing designer Margi Kent to develop a unique onstage look.

Among Nicks's contributions to ''Rumours'' was "[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]", which became the band's only [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hit single. Nicks had also written and recorded the song "[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]", but it was not included on the album because the early versions of the song ran too long, and the band did not want too many slow songs on the album.

In November 1977, after a New Zealand concert on the ''Rumours'' tour, Nicks and Fleetwood secretly began an affair.

=== 1979–1982: ''Tusk'' and ''Mirage'' ===
[[File:Fleetwood Mac - Stevie Nicks (1980).png|thumb|upright|Nicks performing in 1980]]
After the success of the ''Rumours'' album and tour in 1977 to 1978, Fleetwood Mac began recording their third album with Nicks and Buckingham, ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', in the spring of 1978. By this time, Nicks had amassed a large backlog of songs that she had been unable to record with Fleetwood Mac because of the constraint of having to accommodate three songwriters on each album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nicksfix.com/behind_the_music.htm|title=Stevie Nicks&nbsp;– Behind the Music|access-date=June 3, 2010|archive-date=July 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714182105/http://www.nicksfix.com/behind_the_music.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Tusk'' was released on October 19, 1979.

=== Backup vocals and duets ===
While working on ''Tusk'', Nicks sang backup on virtually every track of ''Not Shy'', recorded by musician [[Walter Egan]], a friend of both Nicks and Buckingham's. "[[Magnet and Steel]]", inspired by Nicks, prominently featured her backup vocals and became a hit single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart during the summer of 1978.<ref name="FMnet_PenguinQ&A_2">{{cite web

Nicks's first solo album, ''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]'', was released on July 27, 1981, to critical and commercial acclaim, reaching number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, with four singles making the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and ''Rolling Stone'' deeming her "the Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bella-donna-mw0000191230/awards |title=Bella Donna |website=AllMusic |access-date=February 28, 2014 |archive-date=January 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116130855/http://www.allmusic.com/album/bella-donna-mw0000191230/awards |url-status=live }}</ref>

The day that ''Bella Donna'' reached number one on the ''Billboard'' 200, Nicks was told that her friend Robin Anderson had leukemia. Anderson was pregnant at the time and given only three months to live. She gave birth to a son, appointing Nicks as the child's godmother. "I never got to enjoy ''Bella Donna'' at all because my friend was dying.

''Bella Donna'' introduced Nicks's permanent back-up singers, Sharon Celani and Lori Perry (now Nicks after marrying Stevie's brother Christopher), who have contributed vocals to all of Nicks's solo albums since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inherownwords.com/girls.htm|title=Stevie Nicks on the Girls: Sharon Celani & Lori Perry-Nicks|publisher=Inherownwords.com|access-date=October 6, 2014|archive-date=October 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012023559/http://www.inherownwords.com/girls.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> In November 1981, Nicks embarked on her ''White Winged Dove'' tour, which she had to cut short to record ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]''.

Nicks released her second solo album, ''[[The Wild Heart (album)|The Wild Heart]]'', on June 10, 1983. The album went double platinum, reached number five on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart, and featured three hit singles. It also introduced songwriter and performer [[Sandy Stewart (musician)|Sandy Stewart]] as co-writer and vocalist.

Nicks performed at the second [[US Festival]] at [[Glen Helen Regional Park]] in [[San Bernardino]], California, and later toured the U.S. from June 1983 to November 1983. Nicks appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in December 1983, performing "[[Stand Back]]" and "Nightbird".

Following the tour for ''The Wild Heart'', Nicks commenced work on her third solo album. Originally titled ''Mirror Mirror'', Nicks recorded songs for the album during 1984. However, Nicks was unhappy with the album, and opted to record a new batch of songs in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inherownwords.com/rockalit.htm|title=Stevie Nicks on 'Rock A Little'|website=inherownwords.com|access-date=June 2, 2010|archive-date=October 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008041933/http://inherownwords.com/rockalit.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Rock a Little]]'', as it was retitled, was released November 18, 1985, to commercial success, supported by three successful singles. Nicks toured for ''Rock a Little'' until October 1986, and performed with [[Bob Dylan]] and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers during their tour in Australia.

The tour marked a turning point in Nicks's life. The January before the tour was to begin, a plastic surgeon warned her of severe health problems if she did not stop using cocaine.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story |first=Mick |last=Brown |date=September 8, 2007 |access-date=June 3, 2010 |archive-date=August 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814182335/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> "I said, 'What do you think about my nose?{{'"}}, she recalled on ''The Chris Isaak Hour'' in 2009.

=== 1987–1990: ''Tango in the Night'', ''The Other Side of the Mirror'', and ''Behind the Mask'' ===
In late 1985, Fleetwood Mac began work on ''[[Tango in the Night]]'', but due to her promotional schedule for the ''Rock a Little'' album and subsequent tour, Nicks was mostly unavailable to work on the album with the band except for a few weeks following her stay at the Betty Ford Center in 1986 (which was the inspiration for the song "Welcome to the Room...Sara"). She sent the band demonstrations of her songs to work on in her absence. The album was released in April 1987 and became the band's second-highest selling album, behind ''Rumours''.

Creative differences and unresolved personal issues within the band led Buckingham to quit the group right before their world tour. According to bassist [[John McVie]], a "physically ugly" confrontation between Nicks and Buckingham ensued when Nicks angrily challenged Buckingham's decision to leave the band.<ref name=FMart60>Sykes, Graham. ''Rock Family Trees Transcript''.</ref>

The band embarked on the ''Shake the Cage'' tour in September 1987, with Buckingham replaced by [[Rick Vito]] and [[Billy Burnette]]. The tour was suspended while Nicks suffered from [[myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome]] <!-- (ME/CFS) --> and developed an addiction to Klonopin, though it resumed in 1988. ''Tango in the Night'' met with commercial success and was followed by Fleetwood Mac's ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in November 1988.

Also in 1988, Nicks began work on a fourth solo album with English record producer [[Rupert Hine]]. ''[[The Other Side of the Mirror (album)|The Other Side of the Mirror]]'' was released on May 11, 1989, to commercial success.

Nicks toured the U.S. and Europe from August to November 1989. She later said she had "no memory of this tour" because of her increasing dependency on Klonopin,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=231&c=11 |work=[[People (American magazine)|People]] |date=January 19, 1998 |title=High Priestess |author=Steve Dougherty, Todd Gold |access-date=October 26, 2011 |archive-date=April 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403003101/http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=231&c=11 |url-status=live }}</ref> prescribed in ever increasing amounts by a psychiatrist between 1987 and 1994, in an attempt to keep Nicks from regressing to her former abuse of cocaine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.benzo.org.uk/nicks.htm|title=benzo.org.uk – Stevie Nicks: "Klonopin – more deadly than coke"|website=www.benzo.org.uk|access-date=February 4, 2019|archive-date=September 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911161903/https://www.benzo.org.uk/nicks.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html|title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story|last=Brown|first=Mick|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=September 7, 2007|access-date=February 4, 2019|issn=0307-1235|archive-date=August 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814182335/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1989, Nicks set to work with Fleetwood Mac on ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]'', released in 1990 to moderate commercial success in the U.S. In the UK, however, the album entered the chart at number one and was certified platinum. The band went on a world tour to promote the album, on the last night of which Buckingham and Nicks reunited on stage to perform "Landslide".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Fleetwood Mac, Live at the Great Western Forum, Inglewood, California December 7th, 1990 |magazine=Rolling Stone |author=Steve Pond |date=February 7, 1991}}</ref> After the tour concluded, Nicks left the group over a dispute with Mick Fleetwood, who would not allow her to release the 1977 track "Silver Springs" on her album ''[[Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks]]'', because of his plans to save it for release on a forthcoming Fleetwood Mac box set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/timeline/timeline1990s.html |title=Timeline 1990s |publisher=Go Your Own Way |access-date=June 3, 2010 |archive-date=January 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112225348/http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/timeline/timeline1990s.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Fleetwood knew that the song would be valuable as a selling point for the box set, since over the years, it had gained interest among the band's fans.<ref name=Furman2003 />

=== 1991–1996: ''Timespace'' and ''Street Angel'' ===
On the 10th anniversary of her solo career debut, Nicks released ''Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks'' on September 3, 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/stevie-nicks/discography/66977/ |title=Timespace: The Best of Stevie Nicks by Stevie Nicks |work=MTV Artists |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030002224/http://www.mtv.com/artists/stevie-nicks/discography/66977/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The following year, Fleetwood Mac also released a four-disc box set, ''[[25 Years&nbsp;– The Chain]]'', which included "Silver Springs".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://louderthanwar.com/fleetwood-mac-25-years-the-chain-4-cd-box-set-warner-bros-records-inc/ |title=Fleetwood Mac: 25 Years, The Chain 4 CD box set review |work=Louder Than War |date=June 29, 2012 |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010141410/http://louderthanwar.com/fleetwood-mac-25-years-the-chain-4-cd-box-set-warner-bros-records-inc/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, [[Bill Clinton]] used the Fleetwood Mac hit "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]" as his campaign theme song, and Nicks rejoined the classic ''Rumours'' lineup of the band (including Buckingham) to perform the song at Clinton's 1993 inaugural gala. No plans for an official reunion were made at that time. Nicks was criticized for her weight gain.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXNUWWuzscMC&q=clinton+inauguration+%22stevie+nicks%22+fat&pg=PA367 |title=Milk it!: collected musings on the ...&nbsp;– Google Books |access-date=January 9, 2011 |isbn=0-306-81271-1 |year=2003 |last1=Derogatis |first1=Jim |publisher=Da Capo Press }}{{Dead link|date=May 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Nicks, who is {{convert|5|ft|1|in|m}}, had gained weight, peaking at 175&nbsp;lb (79.4&nbsp;kg). "Klonopin was worse than the cocaine," she has said. "I lost those 8 years of my life. I didn't write, and I had gained so much weight."<ref name="youtube1" />

In late 1993, while Nicks held a baby shower at her house, she tripped over a box, passed out, and cut her forehead near a fireplace. "I'm one of those people who doesn't injure themselves. I was horrified to see that blood. I hadn't had enough wine. I knew it was the Klonopin," she said. Realizing that she needed help, Nicks endured a painful 47-day detoxification in a hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/article_us_weekly_june11_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks&nbsp;– Goes her own way |work=US Weekly |date=June 11–18, 2001 |access-date=October 5, 2011 |archive-date=August 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823071121/http://nicksfix.com/article_us_weekly_june11_2001.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Following her successful detox, Nicks released her fifth solo album, ''[[Street Angel (album)|Street Angel]]'', recorded during 1992 and 1993 using material written mostly in previous years. Released on May 23, 1994, ''Street Angel'' was poorly received, reaching number 45 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200. Nicks has since expressed major disappointment with the album, claiming that a lot of its production work took place during her second stint in rehabilitation, meaning she had little or no say over the final product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nicksfix.com/article_msn_music_may_30_2001.htm |title=Stevie Nicks Talks To MSN Music |website=Nicksfix.com |access-date=February 28, 2014 |date=January 1999 |archive-date=July 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728171910/http://nicksfix.com/article_msn_music_may_30_2001.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Despite a three-month tour in support of the album, Nicks was crushed by the focus on her weight and the poor reception of the album. Disgusted by the criticism she received during the tour for being overweight, she vowed to never set foot on a stage again unless she slimmed down.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stepko |first1=Barbara |title=Stevie Wonder |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/mccalls1.htm |website=Nicksfix.com |access-date=October 17, 2014 |date=May 25, 2001 |archive-date=July 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728182402/http://www.nicksfix.com/mccalls1.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1996, Nicks reunited with Lindsey Buckingham and contributed the duet "Twisted" to the ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' movie soundtrack, while in 1996, the [[Sheryl Crow]]-penned "Somebody Stand by Me" featured on the ''[[Boys on the Side]]'' soundtrack, and Nicks also remade Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'" for Fox's TV hit ''[[Party of Five]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://radio.com/2013/03/18/whenever-i-call-you-friend-stevie-nicks-greatest-collaborations/ |title=Whenever I Call You, Friend: Stevie Nicks' Greatest Collaborations " Radio.com |publisher=Radio.com |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010134628/http://radio.com/2013/03/18/whenever-i-call-you-friend-stevie-nicks-greatest-collaborations/ |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/507970/party-of-five-soundtrack-due-in-96/ |title="Party of Five" Soundtrack Due in '96 |publisher=MTV News |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029191905/http://www.mtv.com/news/507970/party-of-five-soundtrack-due-in-96/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

She has subsequently stated in several interviews that she was not happy with the album or the successful world tour that followed, citing production disputes with Buckingham as a core factor, as well as the absence of fellow female band member Christine McVie.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/a-magical-life/2006/02/09/1139465789637.html?page=fullpage |title=A magical life&nbsp;– Music&nbsp;– Entertainment |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=February 12, 2006 |access-date=January 9, 2011 |first=Guy |last=Blackman |archive-date=July 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728212909/http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/a-magical-life/2006/02/09/1139465789637.html?page=fullpage |url-status=live }}</ref> A documentary of the making of the album, ''Destiny Rules'', was released on DVD in 2004 and chronicles the sometimes-turbulent relationships between band members, especially Buckingham and Nicks, during that time in the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/sep/10/dvdreviews.shopping |title=Pop DVD: Fleetwood Mac, Destiny Rules&nbsp;– Music |work=The Guardian |date=September 10, 2004 |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014223537/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/sep/10/dvdreviews.shopping |url-status=live }}</ref>

After a few months' respite from the ''Say You Will'' tour, Nicks did a four-night stint in May 2005 at [[Caesars Palace]] in Las Vegas, and then did 10 shows with Don Henley dubbed the Two Voices tour. During the summer of 2005, Nicks continued doing solo shows (Gold Dust tour) with pop singer [[Vanessa Carlton]] as the opening act, playing over 20 dates nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=1077&c=11|title=The Blue Letter Archives|publisher=Bla.fleetwoodmac.net|access-date=December 21, 2014|archive-date=December 5, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205033914/http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=1077&c=11|url-status=live}}</ref>

On March 27, 2007, [[Reprise Records]] released ''[[Crystal Visions&nbsp;– The Very Best of Stevie Nicks]]'' in the U.S. The album debuted at number 21 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053163/mcgraw-leads-seven-top-10-debuts-onto-billboard-200 |title=McGraw Leads Seven Top 10 Debuts Onto Billboard 200 |date=April 4, 2007 |magazine=Billboard |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=September 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929200033/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053163/mcgraw-leads-seven-top-10-debuts-onto-billboard-200 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The compilation includes her hit singles, a dance remix, and one new track, a live version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]". Two versions of this album were made, one with just the audio CD and a deluxe version that includes a DVD featuring all of Nicks's music videos with audio commentary from Nicks herself, as well as rare footage from the ''Bella Donna'' recording sessions.

A tour with [[Chris Isaak]], opening in Concord, California, on May 17, 2007, supported the release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://casinoconnectionac.com/issue/june_2007/article/bella_donna |title=Bella Donna -Bella Donna&nbsp;– Casino Connection Atlantic City |publisher=Casinoconnectionac.com |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=September 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140922203715/http://casinoconnectionac.com/issue/june_2007/article/bella_donna |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/04/stevie-nicks-to-join-chris-isaak-on-tour.html |title=Stevie Nicks To Join Chris Isaak on Tour |work=Paste |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010101449/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/04/stevie-nicks-to-join-chris-isaak-on-tour.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Reprise Records initially released two radio-only promotions, the live version of "Landslide" with the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] and "Rock and Roll". Both tracks failed to garner much airplay and made no impact on the charts. Reprise Records released "[[Stand Back#Re-releases|Stand Back]]" (issued with club mixes) on May 29, 2007. "Stand Back", which peaked at number five on the pop singles chart in 1983 and number two on the ''Billboard'' Club chart. Nicks previously reached number one on this chart, with "Planets of the Universe" (from ''Trouble in Shangri-La'') in 2001. The remix single of "Stand Back" debuted on the ''Billboard'' Hot Singles Sales chart on September 15, 2007, at number 10, peaking at number four the following week. It also debuted on the ''Billboard'' Hot Dance Singles Sales chart at number three, later peaking at number one.

On March 31, 2009, Nicks released the album, ''[[The Soundstage Sessions]]'', via Reprise Records. The album debuted at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. The first single from the album, "[[Crash Into Me#Stevie Nicks version|Crash into Me]]", was released as a digital download, along with "Landslide" (orchestra version) as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], on March 17, 2009.

In late 2008, Fleetwood Mac announced that the band would tour in 2009, beginning in March. As per the 2003–2004 tour, Christine McVie would not be featured in the lineup. The tour was branded as a 'greatest hits' show titled "Unleashed", although they played album tracks such as "Storms" and "I Know I'm Not Wrong".

[[File:Stevie Nicks Performing.jpg|thumb|Nicks performing with Dave Stewart in November 2011]]

After completing the ''Unleashed'' tour with Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began work on her first solo album in a decade with [[David A. Stewart]], a musician and record producer best known for being one half of the duo [[Eurythmics]].

Nicks performed in a series of shows in August 2010 ("it's not really a tour", she said). They did not contain any of her new music, because she did not want it to end up on YouTube. The Santa Barbara show benefited a young girl she had met through the Make-a-Wish Foundation in Los Angeles with [[rhabdomyosarcoma]], a rare cancer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2010/jul/26/stevie-nicks-looking-back-charging-forward-new-alb/ |title=Stevie Nicks Is Looking Back, Charging Forward on New Album |date=July 26, 2010 |work=Santa Barbara Independent |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010134530/http://www.independent.com/news/2010/jul/26/stevie-nicks-looking-back-charging-forward-new-alb/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On January 13, 2011, Reprise announced Nicks's upcoming album ''[[In Your Dreams (Stevie Nicks album)|In Your Dreams]]'' would be released on May 3, and the lead single, "[[Secret Love (Stevie Nicks song)|Secret Love]]", would be released on February 8. Reprise provided a free download of the single to fans who ordered the album via certain websites. Nicks originally wrote "Secret Love" in 1976 and recorded a demo of it for Fleetwood Mac's 1977 album, ''Rumours''. It did not make the final cut for the album. The demo version had been circulating among fans for many years prior to its inclusion on ''In Your Dreams''. Nicks promoted the song with a video directed by Dave Stewart. Nicks's goddaughter Kelly appears in the video wearing a vintage dress that Nicks wore on stage in 1976. According to Nicks, Kelly portrays the young Nicks blending with the soul of Nicks's 62-year-old self.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=46793 |title=PrideSource&nbsp;– Stevie Nicks talks gays, 'Glee' controversy and losing weight&nbsp;... with her own music? |work=Pridesource |date=May 5, 2011 |access-date=October 6, 2014 |archive-date=October 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010125725/http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=46793 |url-status=live }}</ref> On the U.S. [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], "Secret Love" was a modest hit on the Adult Contemporary Singles chart, peaking at number 20, and at number 25 on the Triple-A Singles chart.

Nicks has said that her vocal style and performance antics evolved from female singers such as [[Grace Slick]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. She admitted inspiration when she saw Joplin perform live (and opened for her with her first band Fritz) shortly before Joplin's death. Nicks owns a strand of Joplin's stage beads. She also commented that she once saw a woman in her audience dressed in dripping chiffon with a [[Gibson Girl]] hairstyle and big boots, and Nicks knew she wanted something similar.

=== Philanthropy ===
Nicks has started a charity foundation titled Stevie Nicks's Band of Soldiers, which is used for the benefit of wounded military personnel.<ref name=SNBOF>Andrew Gumbel. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/stevie-nicks-rock-follies-394224.html Stevie Nicks: Rock follies.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204222919/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/stevie-nicks-rock-follies-394224.html |date=December 4, 2017 }} ''[[The Independent]]''.

In late 2004, Nicks began visiting Army and Navy medical centers in Washington, DC. While visiting wounded service men and women, she became determined to find an object she could leave with the soldiers that would raise their spirits, motivate, and give them something to look forward to each day. She eventually decided to purchase hundreds of iPod Nanos, load them with music, artists, and playlists, which she would hand select, and autograph them:<ref name=troops>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/journal_visiting_troops.htm |title=Stevie's Journal Entries Regarding Visits to the Injured Troops |publisher=The Nicks Fix |access-date=June 3, 2010 |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714181940/http://www.nicksfix.com/journal_visiting_troops.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

She now regularly delivers these tokens of her appreciation, bringing her closest friends, such as Mick Fleetwood, along to share the experience:<ref name=troops />

{{Blockquote|So, as Mick [Fleetwood] and I went from room to room delivering their tiny iPod, they told us their stories. Mick became his tall, loving, father figure, English self, taking in every word they said, remaining calm (at least on the outside) inspiring them. We floated from room to room down through the halls of the two hospitals over a three-day period. We gave out all our iPods. Right before I left for DC, [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] dug into their pockets and came up with $10,000 for me. In my eyes they went from the coolest rock stars to generous great men; as my press agent Liz Rosenberg said, every returning wounded soldier should be given an iPod. It will be an integral part of their recovery.|source=Stevie Nicks<ref name=troops />}}

=== Style ===
Nicks's style has remained the same throughout her years in the spotlight and even "at 60 she is still working the gossamer tunics and shawls that have influenced two generations of Stevie acolytes and given her performances the feel of a Wiccan ritual," writes ''New York Times'' reporter Ruth La Ferla.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/fashion/09STEVIE.html |title=Still Dressing for Stevie |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 8, 2009 |access-date=July 20, 2015 |archive-date=March 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317123050/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/fashion/09STEVIE.html |url-status=live |last1=Ferla |first1=Ruth La }}</ref>

In the late '70s, Nicks began receiving threatening mail accusing her of witchcraft. Nicks told the ''Los Angeles Times'' in 2013, "In the beginning of my career, the whole idea that some wacky, creepy people were writing, 'You're a witch, you're a witch!' was so arresting. And there I am like, 'No, I'm not! I just wear black because it makes me look thinner, you idiots.'" The witch rumors frightened Nicks so much that she gave up black for a period of time (roughly 1978 to 1982), instead opting to wear colors such as apricot and seafoam green. Nicks later stated that she felt ugly in the new colors, ultimately gave up, and went back to black in 1983. That same year, when asked what she thought about people who still believed the rumor, Nicks said, "I don't like it all and I wish people would stop thinking about that, because I spent thousands of dollars on beautiful black clothes and had to stop wearing them for a long time, because a lot of people scared me."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-stevie-nicks-american-horror-story-20140107-story.html|title = Stevie Nicks talks 'American Horror Story': 'I was scared to go there'|website = [[Los Angeles Times]]|date = January 8, 2014}}</ref>

Nicks sings about the store where her iconic style all started in the song "Gypsy" on Fleetwood Mac's 13th studio album ''Mirage'', released in 1982. In the song, Nicks sings of a store called the Velvet Underground, a boutique in San Francisco, California, where famous rockers like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick were known to shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inherownwords.com/gypsy_velvet_popup.html|title=Stevie Nicks on Gypsy|publisher=In Her Own Words|access-date=November 15, 2017|archive-date=July 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706151508/http://www.inherownwords.com/gypsy_velvet_popup.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nicks's only marriage was to Kim Anderson, the widower of her best friend Robin Anderson.<ref name=":0" /> They married in 1983 soon after Robin Anderson died of [[leukemia]] while the ''Bella Donna'' album was on the top of the charts. Nicks later explained of the marriage, "I was determined to take care of [Robin's] baby, so I said to Kim, 'I don't know, I guess we should just get married.'" Nicks and Anderson divorced after only three months: "And so we got married three months after she died, and it was a terrible, terrible mistake. We didn't get married because we were in love, we got married because we were grieving and it was the only way that we could feel like we were doing anything."<ref name="robin" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nicksfix.com/article_in_style_march2002.htm |title=Desert Rose |publisher=In Style |author=Stephanie Tuck |date=March 2002 |access-date=June 3, 2010 |archive-date=May 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527050753/http://www.nicksfix.com/article_in_style_march2002.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Nicks has said that she [[Voluntary childlessness|consciously chose not to have children of her own]], due to her demanding career and desire to follow her art wherever it should take her: "My mission maybe wasn't to be a mom and a wife; maybe my particular mission was to write songs to make moms and wives feel better."<ref>Stevie Nicks on ABC Downtown, 2001.</ref>

They can have it in their hands, who I was."

Regarding a book based on her life, she has said, "I wouldn't write a book unless I could really tell the truth, and say all the people are in it are represented right{{nbsp}}... If I'm gonna talk about all the people in my life, I need to be old enough and so do they, that nobody's gonna care&nbsp;... I would never write a book about the bad parts. I would mostly revel in the fantastic parts, of which there were so many."<ref name="drew" />

=== Residences ===
Until July 2007, Nicks lived in [[Paradise Valley, Arizona]], a suburb of Phoenix, in a home she had built in 1981 and shared with her brother, Christopher Nicks, his wife, Lori Perry-Nicks, and their daughter, Jessica, her niece. She announced in mid-2007 that her Paradise Valley home would be put up for sale, citing her aspirations to "downsize" and focus more on her charity work, and that in the previous year she had only "spent about two weeks there". The house was put on the market for a reported $3.8 million and later sold for $3 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/01/14/story5.html |title=The Insider: Stevie Nicks sells home in Paradise Valley |work=Phoenix Business Journal |date=January 2008 |access-date=September 16, 2013 |archive-date=December 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213173542/http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/01/14/story5.html |url-status=live }}</ref> She owns an oceanside home in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Doherty |first=Ruth |date=December 1, 2022 |title=Inside the Fleetwood Mac house in Santa Monica |url=https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/fleetwood-mac-house-santa-monica |access-date=October 9, 2024 |website=homesandgardens.com |language=en}}</ref>

In October 2005, Nicks attended the Melbourne Cup Week in Australia, and one of the horse-racing stakes was named after her: The Stevie Nicks Plate. She used this opportunity to launch her promotion of an Australian/New Zealand extension to her ''Gold Dust'' tour in February and March 2006. Nicks toured in Australia and New Zealand with popular Australian performer [[John Farnham]].<ref>By Sharon Krum, Women's Weekly, December 2005.</ref> She also appeared in concert with Tom Petty in June near [[Manassas, Virginia]], and at the [[Bonnaroo]] Music Festival that same month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmlegacy.com/concertssn2006.html |title=The 2006 Stevie Shows |publisher=fmlegacy.com |access-date=June 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510061151/http://www.fmlegacy.com/concertssn2006.html |archive-date=May 10, 2009 }}</ref>
