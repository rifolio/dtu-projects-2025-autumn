'''Shinedown''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Jacksonville, Florida]], formed by singer [[Brent Smith]] in 2001 after the dissolution of his previous band, Dreve. Smith, still under contract with [[record label]] [[Atlantic Records]], recruited the band's original lineup of Jasin Todd as guitarist, [[Brad Stewart]] on bass, and Barry Kerch on drums. Consistent for the first two album cycles, several lineup changes followed in the late 2000s, eventually stabilizing with Smith and Kerch alongside [[Zach Myers]] on guitar and [[Eric Bass]] on bass. The group has released seven studio albums: ''[[Leave a Whisper]]'' (2003), ''[[Us and Them (Shinedown album)|Us and Them]]'' (2005), ''[[The Sound of Madness]]'' (2008), ''[[Amaryllis (Shinedown album)|Amaryllis]]'' (2012), ''[[Threat to Survival]]'' (2015), ''[[Attention Attention]]'' (2018), and ''[[Planet Zero]]'' (2022).

Shinedown has the most number one singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] charts with 21,<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/shinedown-mainstream-rock-airplay-record-killing-fields-1236065824/|title=Shinedown Has 21st Mainstream Rock Airplay No. 1 with 'Killing Fields'|last=Rutherford|first=Kevin|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 12, 2025|access-date=September 13, 2025}}</ref> and all of their released singles have reached the top five on the chart.

===2005–2006: ''Us and Them''===
The band did not start work on a follow-up album until 2005, with the band finding the touring lifestyle too hectic to start writing or recording material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/shinedowns_jasin_todd_we_wrote_the_best_album_we_could.html|title=Shinedown's Jasin Todd: 'We Wrote The Best Album We Could'|website=Ultimate-Guitar.com|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref> This, however, left the band with limited time to record new music, with their record label pressuring the band to get the album out in a six-month time period.<ref name="PGA1"/> Despite the time restrictions, the label did not pressure the band on the album's musical direction after the commercial success of ''Leave a Whisper''.<ref name="GuitarPlayer1"/> The band worked with [[music producer]] Tony Battaglia, and chose to go in a more "mature" and "stripped down" direction for the album's sound, Kerch describing it as just "pure rock."<ref name="PGA1">{{cite web|url=http://puregrainaudio.com/interviews/interview-with-shinedown-bassist-brad-stewart-drummer-barry-kerch|title=Interview with Shinedown bassist Brad Stewart & drummer Barry Kerch|first=Christopher|last=Gonda|website=PureGrainAudio.com|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref><ref name="GuitarPlayer1"/> During the same time, the band was also approached by [[Hollywood Records]] to record a song for a [[tribute album]] for the band [[Queen (band)|Queen]], something the band agreed to out of their respect for the band.<ref name="PGA1"/> They recorded a cover of the track "[[Tie Your Mother Down]]," which was released on ''[[Killer Queen: A Tribute to Queen]]'' (2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/queen-killer-queen-tribute-album-track-listing-revealed/|title=Queen: 'Killer Queen' Tribute Album Track Listing Revealed|date=July 1, 2005|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref>

===2007–2010: ''The Sound of Madness''===
Work on a third studio album began in early 2007. While the record label requested an album to be created in six months, Smith declined, stating that he was not happy with the results of working under the time restraints on the last album, and wished to take his time on the album.<ref name="AlwaysInterview">{{cite web|url=https://alwaysacoustic.com/shinedown-brent-smith-2008-interview/|title=Shinedown Interview with Brent Smith|first=Always|last=Acoustic|date=September 20, 2012|website=AlwaysAcoustic.com|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref> The label agreed to this, ultimately allowing Smith to take 18 months to prep the album.<ref name="AlwaysInterview"/> Part of the long development time was due to internal issues within band members; during this time, Smith fired both Stewart and Todd from the band.<ref name="PilotOnline">{{cite web|url=http://pilotonline.com/entertainment/music/shinedown-has-wrung-hits-out-of-hard-times-and-survived/article_7c12d742-e23f-50bb-81e0-53533850d8de.html|title=Shinedown has wrung hits out of hard times and survived to enjoy good times|first=Alan Sculley|last=Correspondent|website=PilotOnline.com|access-date=October 17, 2017|archive-date=March 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309031536/http://pilotonline.com/entertainment/music/shinedown-has-wrung-hits-out-of-hard-times-and-survived/article_7c12d742-e23f-50bb-81e0-53533850d8de.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Smith let Stewart go due to disagreements with the direction of the band, feeling that Stewart was no longer happy or committed to the band.<ref name="AlwaysInterview"/> Todd was fired due to major disagreements with Smith, and personal problems that were getting in the way of the band.<ref name="AlwaysInterview"/><ref name="SPInterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/a-conversation-with-brent-smith-of-shinedown-1847890668.html |title=A Conversation with Brent Smith of Shinedown |access-date=2017-03-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317055159/http://www.starpulse.com/a-conversation-with-brent-smith-of-shinedown-1847890668.html |archive-date=March 17, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Then-touring guitarist, Zach Myers, later recounted that both Smith and Todd were going through significant [[substance abuse]] issues at the time with drugs and alcohol, which lead to much infighting between the two.<ref name="PilotOnline"/> The band almost broke up during the period, but Smith firing Todd and stopping his drug use helped eliminate the internal issues, and helped the band move forward.<ref name="PilotOnline"/><ref name="SPInterview"/>

Smith spent much of 2007 writing new material with [[Rick Beato]] of Black Dog Sound Recording Studios in Stone Mountain, GA, for the third album.<ref name="SPInterview"/> Sessions were prolific, with Smith writing over 60 songs during the period, though that he now lacked a guitarist and bassist was a constant concern.<ref name="AlwaysInterview"/> Smith recruited a number of studio musicians for its recording sessions; Dave Barrett contributed most of the album's guitars, [[Tim Pierce]] contributed some additional guitar, and [[Chris Chaney]] contributed most of the album's bass guitar.<ref name="SPInterview"/> The rough demos were sent from the record label to music producer [[Rob Cavallo]], who, upon hearing them, told Smith he wanted to produce the album.<ref name="SPInterview"/>

Through multiple successful single releases, and extensive touring, the album ended up being the band's best-selling, staying on the ''Billboard'' 200 charts for 120 consecutive weeks, and eventually being certified double platinum in the United States, indicating two million units sold.<ref name="Billboard2012">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/499358/shinedown-get-harder-better-faster-stronger-on-amaryllis|title=Shinedown Get Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger on 'Amaryllis'|website=Billboard.com|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref><ref name="RIAAcert">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Shinedown&ti=&col=format&ord=asc#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|website=RIAA.com|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref> Six singles were released from the album: "[[Devour (song)|Devour]]", "[[Second Chance (Shinedown song)|Second Chance]]", "[[Sound of Madness]]", "[[If You Only Knew (Shinedown song)|If You Only Knew]]", "[[The Crow & the Butterfly]]", and "[[Diamond Eyes (Boom-Lay Boom-Lay Boom)]]"; each one topping a Billboard rock music chart.<ref name="Billboard2012"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/shinedown-bassist-interviewed-on-103-9-the-x-video/|title=Shinedwon Bassist Interviewed On 103.9 THE X (Video)|date=May 21, 2012|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref><ref name="NC2012"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/28/shinedown-the-sound-of-madness-review |title=Shinedown – The Sound of Madness Review |first=Ed |last=Thompson |date=June 28, 2008 |publisher=IGN |access-date=February 3, 2011 }}</ref> Of particular note was "Second Chance", which crossed over to the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 7, and eventually being certified triple platinum, indicating three million units of the single sold.<ref name="Hot100"/><ref name="RIAAcert"/>
