Frampton was influenced by late 1950s and early 1960s rock acts such as [[Cliff Richard]] and [[the Shadows]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Eddie Cochran]] and later [[the Ventures]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[the Beatles]]. His father introduced him to the recordings of French gypsy [[jazz]] guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]].<ref name=CNN-Phillips /><ref name=TCE-2001-02-04>{{cite web |last=Nager |first=Larry |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/02/04/tem_no_fade_in_framptons.html |title=No fade in Frampton's future |website=Enquirer.com |date=4 February 2001 |access-date=11 March 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130122192714/http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/02/04/tem_no_fade_in_framptons.html |archive-date=22 January 2013}}</ref>

==Music career==
===Early career===
By the age of 12, Frampton played in a band called the Little Ravens. Both he and [[David Bowie]], who was three years older, were pupils at [[Bromley]] Technical School, where Frampton's father was Bowie's art teacher.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Gosling|first1=Emily|title=Teaching David Bowie|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/may-2012/teaching-david-bowie/|access-date=1 January 2017|magazine=Design Week|date=24 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102081741/https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/may-2012/teaching-david-bowie/|archive-date=2 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Little Ravens played on the same bill at school as Bowie's band, George and the Dragons.<ref name=60s70s /> Peter and David would spend lunch breaks together, playing Buddy Holly songs.<ref name=60s70s />

At the age of 14, Peter was playing with a band called the Trubeats followed by a band called the Preachers, who later became Moon's Train, produced and managed by [[Bill Wyman]] of [[the Rolling Stones]].<ref name=60s70s /> Frampton's parents were at the time concerned about their son playing regular late night gigs whilst still at school, so Alex Brown, a member of the Preachers, was designated to meet his parents at their house, along with his son Steven, to show that the band members were responsible people. After this meeting, Frampton was allowed to join the band.

Frampton became a successful child singer, and in 1966 he became a member of [[The Herd (UK band)|the Herd]]. He was the lead guitarist and singer, scoring several British pop hits. Frampton was named "The Face of 1968" by [[teen magazine]] ''Rave''.<ref name=60s70s /><ref name=TCE-2001-02-04 /><ref name=TCE-50>{{cite web |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/02/04/tem_50_years_of_peter.html |title=50 years of Peter Frampton |website=Enquirer.com |date=4 February 2001 |access-date=11 March 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130122085748/http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/02/04/tem_50_years_of_peter.html |archive-date=22 January 2013}}</ref>

In 1969, when Frampton was 18 years old, he joined [[Steve Marriott]] of the [[Small Faces]] to form [[Humble Pie]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Slice of Humble Pie: Peter Frampton's Underrated Band Deserves Another Listen|url=https://www.howardstern.com/show/2016/2/24/8-slices-peter-framptons-humble-pie/|website=Howard Stern|date=24 February 2016|publisher=The Howard Stern Production Company, Inc.|access-date=4 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105083250/https://www.howardstern.com/show/2016/2/24/8-slices-peter-framptons-humble-pie/|archive-date=5 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

While playing with Humble Pie, Frampton also did session recording with other artists, including [[George Harrison]], [[Harry Nilsson]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[John Entwistle]] (on ''[[Whistle Rymes]]'' in 1972). During a recording session with George Harrison at Abbey Road Studios in London in 1970,<ref name=TCE-50 /> [[Pete Drake]] introduced him to the "[[talk box]]" that was to become one of his trademark guitar effects.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Giles|first1=Jeff|title=How Peter Frampton Met the Talk Box|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-frampton-talk-box/|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|date=9 September 2014 |access-date=4 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104234921/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-frampton-talk-box/|archive-date=4 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Lux, Joanna. and David Dayen. – [http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/30669/Peter_Frampton_More_Alive_Than_Ever.html "Peter Frampton: More Alive Than Ever"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111559/http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/30669/Peter_Frampton_More_Alive_Than_Ever.html |date=29 September 2007}}. – [[G4 Media (TV company)|G4 Media]]. – 13 June 2002.</ref><ref>Lovelady, Nicholas. – [http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~ni900332/ "Frampton and the Talkbox"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184009/http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~ni900332/ |date=12 October 2007}}. – [[University of Central Florida]]</ref>

===Solo career===
After four studio albums and one live album with [[Humble Pie]], Frampton left the band and went solo in 1971, just in time to see [[Performance Rockin' the Fillmore|''Rockin' the Fillmore'']] rise up the US charts.<ref name=60s70s /> He remained with [[Dee Anthony]] (1926–2009), the same personal manager that Humble Pie had used.<ref>Crowe, Cameron. – "Frampton: Rock Star of the Year" – ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' – 10 February 1977 – RS232</ref><ref>Greenblatt, Mike. "Peter Frampton". Goldmine 37, no. 10 (09, 2011): 60–64.</ref>

Frampton's own debut was 1972's ''[[Wind of Change (album)|Wind of Change]]'', with guest artists [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Billy Preston]].<ref name=TCE-2001-02-04 /><ref name=TCE-50 /> This album was followed by ''[[Frampton's Camel]]'' in 1973, which featured Frampton working within a group project. In 1974, Frampton released ''[[Somethin's Happening]]''. Frampton toured extensively to support his solo career, joined for three years by his former Herd mate [[Andy Bown]] on keyboards, [[Rick Wills]] on bass, and American drummer John Siomos. In 1975, the ''[[Frampton (album)|Frampton]]'' album was released. The album went to No. 32 in the US charts and is certified [[Gold Album|Gold]] by the [[RIAA]].<ref name=60s70s />

Frampton had little commercial success with his early albums. This changed with his best-selling live album, ''[[Frampton Comes Alive!]]'', in 1976, from which "[[Baby, I Love Your Way]]", "[[Show Me the Way (Peter Frampton song)|Show Me the Way]]", and an edited version of "[[Do You Feel Like We Do]]", were hit singles. The latter two tracks also featured his use of the [[talk box]] guitar effect. The album was recorded in 1975, mainly at the [[Winterland]] Ballroom in San Francisco, California, where Humble Pie had previously enjoyed a good following. Frampton had a new line-up, with Americans [[Bob Mayo]] on keyboards and rhythm guitar and Stanley Sheldon on bass. Wills had been sacked by Frampton at the end of 1974, and Bown had left on the eve of ''Frampton Comes Alive'', to return to England and new fame with [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]. ''Frampton Comes Alive'' was released in early January, debuting on the charts on 14 February at number 191. The album was on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for 97 weeks, of which 55 were in the top 40, of which 10 were at the top. The album beat, among others, [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'' to become the top selling album of 1976,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://americansongwriter.com/on-this-day-in-1976-peter-framptons-classic-frampton-comes-alive-album-topped-the-billboard-200/ | title=On This Day in 1976: Peter Frampton's Classic 'Frampton Comes Alive!'

A tribute to the album's staying power, readers of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked ''Frampton Comes Alive'' No. 3 in a 2012 poll of all-time favourite live albums. The article's text stated, "He was loved by teenage girls, ''and'' their older brothers.

In late 1976, Frampton and manager Dee Anthony visited the [[White House]] at the invitation of [[Steven Ford]], the president's son.<ref>"Random Notes" – 16 December 1976 – RS228</ref>

On 24 August 1979, Frampton received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6819 [[Hollywood Boulevard]] for his contributions to the recording industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/peter-frampton|title=Peter Frampton {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=Walkoffame.com|access-date=14 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624022805/http://www.walkoffame.com/peter-frampton|archive-date=24 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/peter-frampton/|title=Peter Frampton|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=14 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603085426/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/peter-frampton/|archive-date=3 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Setbacks and decline in popularity ===
Frampton's following album, ''[[I'm in You]]'' (1977), contained the hit title single and went platinum, but fell well short of expectations compared to ''[[Frampton Comes Alive!]]''.<ref name="60s70s" /> He starred, with the [[Bee Gees]], in producer [[Robert Stigwood]]'s poorly received film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1978). Frampton's career seemed to be falling as quickly as it had risen.<ref name="60s70s" /><ref name="TCE-2001-02-04" /> He also played guitar on the [[Grease (song)|title song]] of the 1978 film [[Grease (film)|''Grease'']], a song newly written for the film by [[Barry Gibb]].

Frampton suffered a near-fatal car accident in the Bahamas in 1978 that marked the end of his prolific period and the beginning of a long period during which he was less successful. However, he returned to the studio in November 1978 to begin recording the album ''[[Where I Should Be]]''. Among those contributing to the album were past band members [[Stanley Sheldon]] (bass), [[Bob Mayo]] (keyboards/guitar/vocals), and [[John Siomos]] (drums/vocals).<ref name="60s70s" /><ref name="AllMusic-Bio" />  Released in June 1979, the album was certified gold status by July.  The single, "I Can't Stand It," reached No. 14 on the US chart.  This was to be Frampton's last hit single.

In 1980, Frampton's album ''[[Rise Up (Peter Frampton album)|Rise Up]]'' was released to promote his tour in Brazil, although he suffered another serious setback that year when all his guitars were thought destroyed in a [[Latin Carga Convair CV-880 crash|cargo plane crash]] that killed four people. Among the instruments he lost was the black [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] Custom which he had named "Phenix"<ref name=GibsonGuitarGreats>[http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Gibson-Guitar-Greats-Peter-Frampton.aspx Gibson Guitar Greats: Peter Frampton] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916235152/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Gibson-Guitar-Greats-Peter-Frampton.aspx |date=16 September 2018}}, at Gibson.com; published 4 April 2017; retrieved 16 September 2018.</ref> (pictured on the cover of ''Frampton Comes Alive'') given to him by Mark Mariana and first used on the night of the recording of the Humble Pie live album ''Performance'', and which he had used all through his early solo career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gibson.com/news-lifestyle/features/en-us/peterframptontalksaboutwan.aspx |title=Gibson Guitars: "Peter Frampton On Wanting to Find a New Guitar, Not Wanting to Be Alive, and Definitely Not Wanting to be Eric Clapton" |website=Gibson.com |access-date=29 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130091310/http://www.gibson.com/news-lifestyle/features/en-us/peterframptontalksaboutwan.aspx |archive-date=30 January 2018}}</ref> As it turned out the guitar was saved from burning in the crash and sold to a musician; many years later it was recovered and returned to him, in December 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/peter-frampton-reunited-with-best-guitar-after-31-years/?_r=0|title=Peter Frampton Reunited with 'Best Guitar' After 31 Years|first=James C.|last=McKinnley Jr.|date=3 January 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=3 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204143134/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/peter-frampton-reunited-with-best-guitar-after-31-years/?_r=0|archive-date=4 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The album eventually turned into ''[[Breaking All the Rules (Peter Frampton album)|Breaking All the Rules]]'', released the next year in 1981.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK0iAAAAIBAJ&dq=%22Rise+Up%22+Peter+Frampton+album&pg=PA16&article_id=3547,2986018 |title=The Beaver County Times}}</ref> These albums were the first he recorded almost completely live.<ref name=80s>{{cite web |url=http://www.frampton.com/80.html |title=Peter Frampton History – 80's |website=Frampton.com |access-date=11 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015061814/http://www.frampton.com/80.html |archive-date=15 October 2013}}</ref> In 1982, following the release of ''[[The Art of Control]]'', Frampton tried unsuccessfully to split his ties with [[A&M Records]]; he re-signed with the label in 2006 and released his [[Grammy Award]]–winning ''[[Fingerprints (Peter Frampton album)|Fingerprints]]''.<ref name="GRAMMY">{{cite web| url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4302|pure_url=yes}} | title = Grammy awards | work = [[AllMusic]]| access-date = 17 December 2008}}</ref>

=== Return ===
Although his albums generally met with little commercial success, Frampton continued to record throughout the 1980s. He achieved a brief, moderate comeback of sorts in 1986 with the release of his ''[[Premonition (Peter Frampton album)|Premonition]]'' album, and the single "Lying", which became a hit on [[Mainstream Rock]] chart. Most notably, he also united with old friend David Bowie, and both worked together to make albums. Frampton played on Bowie's 1987 album ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'' and sang and played on the accompanying [[Glass Spider Tour]].<ref name="AllMusic-Bio" /><ref name="TCE-2001-02-04" /><ref name="80s" /> In 2013, he credited his participation in this tour for helping revive his career.<ref name="AM13">{{Citation | title=David Bowie Helped Revive Peter Frampton | url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/13/January/03David_Bowie_Helped_Revive_Peter_Frampton.shtml | access-date=3 January 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105231807/http://www.antimusic.com/news/13/January/03David_Bowie_Helped_Revive_Peter_Frampton.shtml | archive-date=5 January 2013 | url-status=live}}</ref>

Looking for the band experience again after touring with Bowie, Frampton kept referencing Steve Marriott, and at the beginning of 1991 rejoined his old Humble Pie mate for some shows (Marriott's last English gigs) at the Half Moon in Putney, London. The chemistry was still there for a while, as both Frampton and Marriott laid down some tracks in L.A. and prepared to do a "Frampton-Marriott" tour. Marriott abruptly returned to England in April and he died in a house fire less than 24 hours after his return. Broken up by Marriott's death, Frampton went off the road for a time, then reformed his old touring band with his old friends Bob Mayo and John Regan. At least three songs, and possibly a fourth, from the ended Marriott-Frampton partnership were subsequently recorded; two ending up on Frampton's "Shine On" compilation, a third on his subsequent solo album.

In the late 1990s, Frampton starred in an [[infomercial]] plugging the eMedia Guitar Method, a piece of instructional software represented as an alternative to taking actual guitar lessons. He claimed in the infomercial that the software was the best way to learn guitar.<ref name=90s>{{cite web |url=http://www.frampton.com/90.html |title=Peter Frampton History – '90s |website=Frampton.com |access-date=11 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417143914/http://www.frampton.com/90.html |archive-date=17 April 2014}}</ref>

In 1994, Frampton wrote and released the album ''[[Peter Frampton (album)|Peter Frampton]]'', the final version of which contained material recorded on Tascam cassette recorders.

===Marriages, other relationships and family===
Frampton has been married three times and has three children. His first marriage was to Mary Lovett, from 1972 to 1976.

Frampton was sued by J. "Penny" McCall in 1978 for [[palimony]]. McCall asked for Frampton's earnings during the five years that they were together. According to McCall, she left her husband and gave up her job as a rock promoter and devoted herself full-time to Frampton, just as he achieved superstar status. A New York judge ruled that Frampton and McCall never intended to marry each other and "never held themselves out to the public as husband and wife" and dismissed her complaint because to act otherwise would condone [[adultery]]. The case set precedent in New York.<ref>{{cite news | title=Peter Frampton Leaves Mark on Divorce and Family Law | url=http://www.johnkgrubb.com/peter-frampton-leaves-mark-on-divorce-and-family-law.html | work=John K.

He moved to [[Indian Hill, Ohio]], a suburb of [[Cincinnati]], in June 2000. This is the birthplace of his ex-wife Elfers, and the city in which they were married in 1996. They chose to live there to be closer to Elfers' family.<ref name=TCE-2001-02-04 /> In 2014, Frampton moved back to Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cincinnati.com/blogs/arts/2013/02/05/peter-frampton-has-moved-to-nashville/|title=Peter Frampton has moved to Nashville &#124; Arts in Focus|website=Cincinnati.com|access-date=11 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311053014/http://www2.cincinnati.com/blogs/arts/2013/02/05/peter-frampton-has-moved-to-nashville/|archive-date=11 March 2014}}</ref>

{{Quote box| quote = The worst thing about playing for me is when I'm soloing, I have to actually think about what I'm playing. I don't want to think – I want it just to be coming from my heart. That's how I always played. And now I do have to think a little bit, because I'll be in the middle of the passage and I'll say, 'That finger is not going to get there in time!' So I do a regroup and I use one finger for many notes that I used to use three fingers for.}}

As to people asking if he's depressed with his condition, he responds, "you have to accept the things you cannot change. I learned that in [[Alcoholics Anonymous|A.A.]], and in many other places. What I have is not life-threatening, thank God, but it's life-changing, and I'm going with the flow."<ref name=":0" />

==Equipment==
On the cover of the double live album ''Frampton Comes Alive'', Frampton plays a highly customized 1954 black Gibson Les Paul Custom that was given to him during a concert by his friend, Marc Mariana. While touring in 1980, the guitar and other instruments and stage equipment were placed on a cargo flight from Venezuela to Panama. The plane [[1980 Latin Carga Convair CV-880 crash|crashed shortly after takeoff]] and the cargo was presumed destroyed. However, the guitar apparently had survived and Frampton was able to recover it in 2011 after a collector spotted it in Curaçao .<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/07/144799712/framptons-dream-guitar-recovered-decades-later|title=Frampton's Dream Guitar, Recovered Decades Later|website=NPR|date=7 January 2012}}</ref> He continues to play the Les Paul now known as the "Phenix".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/2015/Custom/Peter-Frampton-Phenix-1954-Les-Paul-Custom.aspx|title=Peter Frampton 'Phenix' 1954 Les Paul Custom|website=Legacy.com|access-date=17 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Peter Frampton's 'Phenix' Les Paul: The Guitar That Rose From the Ashes | website=ThaliaCapos.com | date=2018-07-20 | url=https://www.thaliacapos.com/blogs/blog/peter-frampton-s-phenix-les-paul-the-guitar-that-rose-from-the-ashes | access-date=2025-07-19}}</ref>

Frampton was known as the artist who made the [[talk box]] famous. Frampton's talk box was used to transfer the guitar's sound through a plastic tube attached to a microphone. The effect is Frampton's melodic guitar simulating speech while asking the audience on the live track "Do You Feel Like We Do?" Frampton also now sells his own line of custom-designed "Frampton" products, including the talk box.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.frampton.com/framptone.html|title=Peter Frampton Frampton products|date=13 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713161422/http://www.frampton.com/framptone.html|archive-date=13 July 2006}}</ref>

In 1987, Frampton played two natural-finish maple bodies [[Pensa Custom Guitars|Pensa-Suhr Strat types]], hand-made by New York-based John Suhr. He used a Coral electric sitar, given to him in the late 70s and previously owned by [[Jimi Hendrix]], on David Bowie's 1987 album ''[[Never Let Me Down]]''.<ref name=MusicianMag>{{Citation | last=Isler | first=Scott | title=David Bowie Opens Up – A Little | journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |date=August 1987 | pages=60–73}}</ref>
