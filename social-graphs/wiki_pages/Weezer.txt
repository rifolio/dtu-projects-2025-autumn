'''Weezer''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1992. Since 2001, the band has consisted of [[Rivers Cuomo]] (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), [[Patrick Wilson (drummer)|Patrick Wilson]] (drums, backing vocals), [[Brian Bell]] (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), and [[Scott Shriner]] (bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals). They have sold 10 million albums in the United States and more than 35 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|date=September 22, 2013|title=Weezer Album Sales Statistics|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/weezer-album-sales-statistics/|access-date=April 10, 2014|publisher=Statistic Brain|archive-date=September 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925023544/http://www.statisticbrain.com/weezer-album-sales-statistics/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After signing to [[Geffen Records]] in 1993, Weezer released their acclaimed self-titled debut album, also known as the [[Weezer (Blue Album)|Blue Album]], in May 1994. Backed by music videos for the singles "[[Undone – The Sweater Song]]", "[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]", and "[[Say It Ain't So]]", the Blue Album became a [[multi-platinum]] success. Weezer's second album, ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'' (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but achieved [[cult following|cult status]] and acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and ''Pinkerton'' are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for ''Pinkerton'', the founding bassist, [[Matt Sharp]], left and Weezer went on hiatus.

In 2001, Weezer returned with the [[Weezer (Green Album)|Green Album]] with their new bassist, [[Mikey Welsh]]. With a more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented sound, and promoted by singles "[[Hash Pipe]]" and "[[Island in the Sun (Weezer song)|Island in the Sun]]", it was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left for health reasons and was replaced by Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'' (2002), incorporated a [[hard rock]] sound and achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]]'' (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single "[[Beverly Hills (Weezer song)|Beverly Hills]]" became Weezer's first single to top the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and their first to reach the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

In 2008, Weezer released the [[Weezer (Red Album)|Red Album]]; its lead single, "[[Pork and Beans (song)|Pork and Beans]]", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a [[Grammy]]-winning music video. ''[[Raditude]]'' (2009) and ''[[Hurley (album)|Hurley]]'' (2010) both featured more modern pop production,<ref>{{cite web|title=In the studio: Weezer talks lyrics, the new album title, Ric Ocasek - The Music Mix - EW.com|work=EW.com|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/07/17/weezer-new-album-title-ric-ocasek/|access-date=October 3, 2014|archive-date=July 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719045150/http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/07/17/weezer-new-album-title-ric-ocasek/|url-status=dead}}</ref> along with songs co-written with other artists, receiving further mixed reviews and moderate sales. ''[[Everything Will Be Alright in the End]]'' (2014) and the [[Weezer (White Album)|White Album]] (2016) returned to a rock style that was reminiscent of their 1990s sound, mixed with modern alternative production, and achieved more positive reviews. ''[[Pacific Daydream]]'' (2017) returned to more mainstream pop sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/10/27/560044425/how-weezer-traded-power-chords-for-pop/|title=How Weezer Traded Power Chords For Pop|date=October 27, 2017|publisher=National Public Radio|access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref> In 2019, Weezer released an album of covers, the [[Weezer (Teal Album)|Teal Album]], followed by the [[Weezer (Black Album)|Black Album]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/11/weezer-black-album-release-date-zombie-bastards/|title=Weezer Set Release Date for The Black Album, Share "Zombie Bastards"|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|access-date=February 20, 2019}}</ref> In 2021, they released ''[[OK Human]]'', which featured an [[orchestral pop]] sound and received acclaim, followed by the hard rock-inspired ''[[Van Weezer]]''.

===Formation and first years (1986–1994)===

They returned to live shows in June 2000, playing small unpromoted concerts once again under the name Goat Punishment.{{sfn|Luerssen|2004|p=286}} In June 2000, the band joined the American [[Warped Tour]] for nine dates.{{sfn|Luerssen|2004|p=292}}<ref>{{cite web|first=Rob|last=Mancini|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1431310/no-doubt-lit-weezer-to-get-warped/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316214005/http://www.mtv.com/news/1431310/no-doubt-lit-weezer-to-get-warped/|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 16, 2018|title=No Doubt, Lit, Weezer To Get Warped|publisher=MTV|date=June 16, 2000|access-date=March 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/warped-tour-lineup-best-years/|title=10 most memorable Warped Tour lineups|date=May 10, 2019|magazine=Alternative Press|language=en-US|access-date=January 11, 2022}}</ref>

Eventually the band went back into the studio to produce a third album, the "[[Weezer (Green Album)|Green Album]]".

Weezer took an experimental approach to the recording process of its fourth album by allowing fans to download in-progress mixes of new songs from its official website in return for feedback.{{sfn|Luerssen|2004|p=398}} After the release of the album, the band said that this process was something of a failure, as the fans did not supply the group with coherent, constructive advice. Cuomo eventually delegated song selection for the album to the band's original A&R rep, Todd Sullivan, saying that Weezer fans chose the "wackest songs". Only the song "Slob" was included on the album due to general fan advice.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://wma.weezernation.com/200205gw.html|title=Odder Than Hell|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103123917/http://wma.weezernation.com/200205gw.html|archive-date=November 3, 2007|access-date=July 9, 2005}}</ref>

The recording was also done without input from Weezer's record label, [[Interscope]]. Cuomo had what he then described as a "massive falling out" with the label. In early 2002, well before the official release of the album, the label sent out a letter to radio stations requesting the song be pulled until an official, sanctioned single was released. Interscope also briefly shut down Weezer's audio/video download webpage, removing all the MP3 demos. In April 2002, former bassist Matt Sharp sued the band, alleging, among several accusations, that he was owed money for cowriting several Weezer songs. The suit was later settled out of court.<ref name="allm"/>

The band's fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'', was released on May 14, 2002, only one year after its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/maladroit-mw0000222105|title=Maladroit – Weezer|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 15, 2011}}</ref> The album served as a harder-edged version of the band's trademark catchy pop-influenced music, and was replete with busy 1980s-style guitar solos. Although met with generally positive critical reviews, its sales were not as strong as those for the Green Album. Two singles were released from the album. The music video for "[[Dope Nose]]" featured an obscure [[Bōsōzoku|Japanese motorcycle gang]], and was put into regular rotation. The song reached No. 8 on the [[Alternative Airplay|Billboard Modern Rock chart.]]<ref name="Weezer"/> The music video for "[[Keep Fishin']]" combined Weezer with [[the Muppets]], and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.

After the success of ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]],'' the band decided to take a break. Cuomo returned to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he ended up graduating [[cum laude]] and as a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 2006.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Rivers Cuomo's Harvard Graduation|newspaper=Spin|date=June 9, 2006|url=https://www.spin.com/2006/06/rivers-cuomos-harvard-graduation/}}</ref> Cuomo also married Kyoko Ito on June 18, 2006, a woman he had known since March 1997. The wedding was attended by the current members of the band as well as [[Matt Sharp]] and [[Jason Cropper]]. During this break, Wilson and Bell appeared in the 2006 film ''[[Factory Girl (2006 film)|Factory Girl]]'' playing [[John Cale]] and [[Lou Reed]] respectively, as well as contributing a cover of the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] song "[[Heroin (The Velvet Underground song)|Heroin]]" for the film.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Weezer Covers Velvet Underground For Biopic Soundtrack|newspaper=Spin|date=January 25, 2006|url=https://www.spin.com/2006/01/weezer-covers-velvet-underground-biopic-soundtrack/}}</ref> Also during this time, Bell started a new project, [[the Relationship]].

In October 2008, the group announced that the third single would be "[[The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)]]", the song was met with critical praise.

On May 30, 2008, the [[Toledo Free Press]] revealed in an interview with Shriner that Weezer would be unveiling the "Hootenanny Tour", in which fans would be invited to bring their own instruments to play along with the band. Said Shriner: "They can bring whatever they want... oboes, keyboards, drums, violins, and play the songs with us as opposed to us performing for them."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toledofreepress.com/?id=7947|title=Toledoan still 'freaks out' over being in Weezer|publisher=Toledofreepress.com|access-date=September 26, 2010}}</ref>

The band performed five dates in Japan at the beginning of September and then embarked on what was dubbed the "Troublemaker" tour, consisting of 21 dates around North America, including two in Canada. [[Angels and Airwaves]] and [[Tokyo Police Club]] joined the band as support at each show, and Bell's other band the Relationship also performed at a handful of dates. Shortly before the encore at each show, the band would bring on fans with various instruments and perform "Island in the Sun" and "Beverly Hills" with the band. At a show in Austin, after Tokyo Police Club had played its set, Cuomo was wheeled out in a box and mimed to a recording of rare Weezer demo, "My Brain", dressed in pajamas and with puppets on his hands, before being wheeled off again. This bizarre event later surfaced as the climax to a promo video for Cuomo's second demo album, ''[[Alone 2|Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo]]''.

Weezer toured with [[Blink-182]] in 2009, including an August 30 stop at the [[Virgin Festival]] at [[Merriweather Post Pavilion]] in [[Columbia, Maryland]]. Drummer [[Josh Freese]] joined Weezer on a temporary basis to play drums on the tour, while Wilson switched to guitar. Wilson said in an interview for Yahoo!

Soon after the release of the White Album, Cuomo discussed plans for Weezer's next album, provisionally titled the "Black Album". Cuomo said the album would tackle "more mature topics" and be "less summer day and more winter night", and suggested the band could return to the recording studio as soon as October 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/weezer-4-1205507|title=Weezer's next album could sound like 'Beach Boys gone bad'|date=2016-04-20|newspaper=NME|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-20}}</ref> Weezer delayed recording after Cuomo felt his new material was more "like reveries from a beach at the end of the world [... as if] [[the Beach Boys]] and [[the Clash]] fell in love by the ocean and had one hell of an amazing baby".<ref name="billboard">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/weezer-new-album-pacific-daydream-7933887/|title=Weezer Announces New Album 'Pacific Daydream'|magazine=Billboard|access-date=October 28, 2017|date=August 17, 2017}}</ref>

To write the album, Cuomo used various musical and lyrical fragments he had collected over time. He kept an archive of song ideas and hired programmers to organize a spreadsheet of lyric snippets by [[beats per minute]], syllable, and [[Key (music)|key]] to call from whenever stuck. "Instead of trying to force myself to feel inspired, I can just go into the spreadsheet and search [...] I just try them out to see which ones work magically."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vogel|first=Gretchen|date=September 14, 2016|title='Motherless babies!'

=== Instrumentation and lyrics ===
Weezer's music is generally characterized by loud guitars, abundance of [[Hook (music)|hooks]], and perceived [[Nerd|nerdiness]]. According to [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of ''[[AllMusic]]'', the band's style "merges the heavy [[power pop]] of arena rockers like [[Cheap Trick]] and the angular guitar leads of [[Pixies (band)|the Pixies]] while injecting their melodies with doses of '70s metal."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Weezer Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More {{!}} Al... |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/weezer-mn0000243008#biography |access-date=2025-03-30 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref> Throughout its career, Weezer has maintained what has been described as a "heavy, guitar-oriented sound [played] over a steady, danceable groove."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Covach|first1=John|last2=Flory|first2=Andrew|title=What's That Sound?: An Introduction to Rock and Its History|date=July 1, 2022|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|page=478|edition=Sixth}}</ref> The band's early material, such as the material on its debut album, was said to have "embodied the self-awareness of the intelligent alternative rock slacker." According to Tim Sendra of ''AllMusic'', the group's debut album "fuses the raucous energy of punk, the loser-friendly geekiness of indie rock, the guitar power of grunge, and the huge hooks of radio rock [combined with] some heavy metal guitar heroics."<ref>{{Citation |title=Weezer [Blue Album] - Weezer {{!}} Album {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/weezer-blue-album--mw0000329481 |access-date=2025-03-30 |language=en}}</ref>  The sound present on the band's second album, ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'', has been described as "darker [and] messier" than its predecessor.<ref>{{Cite web|author1=Richard Bienstock|date=May 13, 2021|title=Rivers Cuomo on the Biological Need to Shred, Heavy Metal, and Why Singing Your Solos First Makes For Good Phrasing|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/rivers-cuomo-on-the-biological-need-to-shred-heavy-metal-and-why-singing-your-solos-first-makes-for-good-phrasing|access-date=November 13, 2024|website=Guitar Player|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hickie |first=James |title=9 bands commonly mistaken as emo who really aren't |url=https://www.altpress.com/bands-mistaken-as-emo/ |access-date=2025-03-30 |website=Alternative Press Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> ''[[Weezer (Green Album)|Green]]'' was considered to be a return to the "tight" pop sound of Weezer's debut album.<ref>{{Citation |title=Weezer [Green Album] - Weezer {{!}} Album {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/weezer-green-album--mw0000719526 |access-date=2025-05-12 |language=en}}</ref> According to Erlewine, ''[[Maladroit]]'' features "a tougher sound -- nowhere near as raw as ''Pinkerton'', yet similarly loud and raucous, overflowing with guitars spitting out riffs and solos with a gleeful abandon."<ref>{{Citation |title=Maladroit - Weezer {{!}} Album {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/maladroit-mw0000222105 |access-date=2025-05-12 |language=en}}</ref> 2005's ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]]'' was considered to be a "return to [the] musical, emotional bloodletting" of ''Pinkerton''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Make Believe - Weezer {{!}} Album {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/make-believe-mw0000476929 |access-date=2025-05-12 |language=en}}</ref> On ''[[Weezer (Red Album)|Red]]'', the band began to incorporate longer song forms.<ref>{{Citation |title=Weezer [Red Album] - Weezer {{!}} Album {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/weezer-red-album--mw0000789075 |access-date=2025-05-12 |language=en}}</ref>   

The band's aesthetic and lyrics have been described as "blurring the line between serious and humorous." The lyrical tone on ''Pinkerton'' has been described as "confessional." According to Erlewine, "None of the members of Weezer, especially leader Rivers Cuomo, were conventional rockers: they were kids who holed up in their garage to play along with their favorite records when they weren't studying or watching TV. As a result, their music is infused with a quirky sense of humor and an endearing awkwardness."<ref name=":1" /> 

== Legacy and influence ==
Weezer has sustained a cult following throughout its career.
