Thanks to their Split Enz connection, the newly formed Crowded House had an established [[Australasia]]n fanbase.<ref name="McF"/> They began by playing at festivals in Australia and New Zealand and released their debut album, ''Crowded House'', in August 1986.<ref name="McF"/> Capitol Records initially failed to see the band's potential and gave them only low-key promotion,<ref name="sss"/> forcing the band to play at small venues to try to gain attention. The album's first single, "[[Mean to Me (Crowded House song)|Mean to Me]]", reached the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart top 30 in June.<ref name="Kent"/> It failed to chart in the US,<ref name="AllmusicSingle"/> but moderate American airplay introduced US listeners to the group.

The next single, "[[Don't Dream It's Over]]", was released in October 1986 and proved an international hit, reaching number two on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref name="AllmusicSingle"/> and number one in Canada.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0804&volume=46&issue=4&issue_dt=May%2002%201987&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=50lgngc1daom80fs32cjjs9ne6 "Top Singles – Volume 46, No.&nbsp;4, May&nbsp;02&nbsp;1987"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019145310/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0804&volume=46&issue=4&issue_dt=May%2002%201987&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=50lgngc1daom80fs32cjjs9ne6 |date=19 October 2012 }} ''Library and Archives Canada''</ref> New Zealand radio stations initially gave the song little support until months later when it became internationally successful. Ultimately, the song reached number one on the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand singles chart]] and number eight in Australia.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZCharts"/> It remains the group's most commercially successful song.

In March 1987 the group were awarded "Best New Talent", along with "[[ARIA Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]" and "Best Video" awards for "Don't Dream It's Over", at the [[inaugural ARIA Music Awards]].<ref name="ARIA List">{{cite web|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-artist.php?letter=C&artist=Crowded%20House|title=Artist: Crowded House|publisher=[[ARIA]]|access-date=13 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726203141/http://ariaawards.com.au/history-by-artist.php?letter=C&artist=Crowded%20House|archive-date=26 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The video also earned the group the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist]] that year.<ref name=mtv87>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20080830021744/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1987/ "MTV Music Video Awards 1987"]}} ''[[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV]]'' – NOTE: Click on "winners" tab</ref> The song has often been [[cover version|covered]] by other artists and gave [[Paul Young]] a hit single in 1991.

As the band's primary songwriter, Neil Finn was under pressure to create a second album to match their debut and the band joked that one potential title for the new release was ''Mediocre Follow-Up''.<ref name="sss"/> Eventually titled ''Temple of Low Men'', their second album was released in July 1988 with strong promotion by Capitol Records. The album did not fare as well as their debut in the US, only reaching number 40 and selling around 200,000 copies,<ref name="AllmusicAlbum"/> but it achieved Australasian success, reaching number one in [[ARIA Charts|Australia]]<ref name="AusCharts"/> and number two in New Zealand.<ref name="NZCharts"/> The first single "[[Better Be Home Soon]]" peaked at number two on both Australian and New Zealand singles charts<ref name="AusCharts"/><ref name="NZCharts"/> and reached top 50 in the US,<ref name="AllmusicSingle"/> though the following four singles were less successful.<ref name="AusCharts"/><ref name="NZCharts"/>

Crowded House undertook a short tour of Australia and Canada to promote the album, with Eddie Rayner on keyboards. Multi-instrumentalist Mark Hart, who would eventually become a full band member, replaced Rayner in January 1989. After the tour, Finn fired Seymour from the band.<ref name=denton/> [[Music journalist]] [[Ed Nimmervoll]] claimed that Seymour's temporary departure was because Finn blamed him for causing his [[writer's block]];<ref name="Howl"/> however, Finn cited "artistic differences" as the reason.<ref name=denton/> Seymour said that after a month he contacted Finn and they agreed that he would return to the band.<ref name=denton/>

===Early 1990s (1991–1994)===
{{Main|Tim Finn|Woodface|Together Alone}}

Crowded House took a break after the Canadian leg of the ''Temple of Low Men'' tour. Neil Finn and his brother Tim recorded songs they had co-written for their own album, ''[[Finn (album)|Finn]]''.<ref name="sss"/> Following the recording sessions with Tim, Neil began writing and recording a third Crowded House album with Hester and Seymour, but these tracks were rejected by the record company, so Neil asked Tim if Crowded House could use the ''Finn'' songs. Tim jokingly agreed on the proviso that he become a member, which Neil apparently took literally. With Tim as an official member, the band returned to the studio.<ref name="sss"/>

The new tracks, as well as some from the previously rejected recordings were combined to make ''Woodface'', which was released in July 1991. The album features eight tracks co-written by Neil and Tim,<ref name="sss"/> which feature the brothers [[harmony|harmonising]] on lead vocals, except on the sombre "All I Ask" on which Tim sang lead. The track was later used on AIDS awareness commercials in Australia.<ref name="sss"/> Five of the album's tracks were Neil's solo compositions and two were by Hester, the exuberant "Italian Plastic", which became a crowd favourite at concerts<ref name="sss"/> and the [[hidden track]] "I'm Still Here".

"[[Chocolate Cake (song)|Chocolate Cake]]", a humorous comment on American excesses that was not taken well by some US critics and sections of the American public was released in June 1991 as the first single. It failed to chart in the US; however, it reached number two on Billboard's [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name="AllmusicSingle"/> The song peaked at number seven in New Zealand and reached the top 20 in Australia.<ref name="AusCharts"/><ref name="NZCharts"/> The second single, "[[Fall at Your Feet]]", was less successful in Australia and New Zealand but did at least reach the US [[Hot 100]].<ref name="AllmusicSingle"/> The album reached number one in New Zealand,<ref name="NZCharts"/> number two in Australia,<ref name="AusCharts"/> number six in the UK<ref name="UKCharts">[https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ "Official Charts – Crowded House"] ''Official Charts''</ref><ref>{{Cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=[[Guinness World Records|Guinness]]|location=London, UK|isbn=1-904994-10-5}}</ref> and made the top 20 in several European countries.<ref>[http://norwegiancharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Crowded+House "Discography Crowded House"] norwegiancharts.com</ref><ref>[http://swedishcharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Crowded+House "Discography Crowded House"] swedishcharts.com</ref><ref>[http://dutchcharts.nl/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Crowded+House "Discografie Crowded House"] dutchcharts.nl</ref> The third single from ''Woodface'', "[[Weather With You]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;7 in early 1992 giving the band their highest UK chart placement. By contrast, the album had limited success in the US, only reaching number 83 on the Billboard 200 Album Chart and selling 225,000 copies.<ref name="AllmusicAlbum"/>

Despite the success of the album, Tim Finn left Crowded House suddenly part-way through the UK leg of the ''Woodface'' tour, a few hours before the band were due to play at King Tut's Club in Glasgow on 1 November 1991. Neil Finn noted that "on stage, it just didn't feel right for us or him. We're very off-the-cuff and conversational, whereas Tim is into creating a spectacle and the two approaches don't gel all that well... We'd all open our mouths at the same time and then stop and go, Oh, after you. From Tim's point of view it was quite a relief to put it all on the table, I think. For half the set he was standing there with his acoustic guitar, not really feeling part of it." Paul Hester commented that "both sides felt good about parting before it could get ugly."<ref name="McF"/><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/25/crowded-house-internal-tensions-artistic-agony-woodface-rocks-back-pages "Crowded House: internal tensions, artistic agony and the melodic miracles behind Woodface"] – article by Phil Sutcliffe in ''[[Q Magazine]]'', July 1992 (reprinted in ''The Guardian'', 25 March 2015)</ref>

For their fourth album, ''Together Alone'', Crowded House used producer [[Youth (producer)|Martin Glover (aka "Youth")]] and invited touring musician Mark Hart (guitar and keyboards) to become a permanent band member.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/> The album was recorded at [[Karekare, New Zealand|Karekare]] Beach, New Zealand, which gave its name to the opening track, "Kare Kare".

Worried that their goodbye had been too low-key and had disregarded their home fans, the band performed the ''Farewell to the World'' concert on the steps of the [[Sydney Opera House]] on 24 November 1996, which raised funds for the [[Sydney Children's Hospital]]. The concert featured the line-up of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mark Hart and Paul Hester. Tim Finn and Peter Jones both made guest appearances. Support bands on the day were [[Custard (band)|Custard]], [[Powderfinger]] and [[You Am I]].

[[File:Paul-hester-sf-np1.jpg|thumb|Paul Hester (1959–2005)]]Following the 1996 break-up of Crowded House, the members embarked upon a variety of projects. Neil Finn released two solo studio albums, ''[[Try Whistling This]]'' (1998) and ''[[One Nil]]'' (2001), as well as two live albums, ''[[Sessions at West 54th (Neil Finn album)|Sessions at West 54th]]'' (2000) and ''[[7 Worlds Collide (album)|7 Worlds Collide]]'' (2001). ''7 Worlds Collide'' saw him performing with guest musicians including [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Johnny Marr]], [[Ed O'Brien]] and [[Phil Selway]] of [[Radiohead]], Tim Finn, Sebastian Steinberg, [[Lisa Germano]] and Betchadupa (featuring his son [[Liam Finn]]). A double CD and DVD of the shows were released in November 2001.

===Reunion and ''Time on Earth'' (2006–2009)===
{{Main|Time on Earth|Matt Sherrod}}
[[File:Matt Sherrod Crowded House Dublin 220607.jpg|thumb|Matt Sherrod, Dublin, 2007]]In 2006 Neil Finn asked Nick Seymour to play bass on his third solo album. Seymour agreed and the two joined up with producer and multi-instrumentalist [[Ethan Johns]] to begin recording.<ref name="Howl"/> As the recording sessions progressed it was decided that the album would be issued under the Crowded House band name, rather than as a Neil Finn solo album. In January 2007, the group publicly announced their reformation and on 23 February, after 20&nbsp;days of auditions, former [[Beck]] drummer Matt Sherrod joined Finn, Seymour and Mark Hart to complete the new line up.<ref name="Howl"/> As Sherrod and Hart had not participated in the initial sessions, four new tracks were recorded with producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] including the album's first single "[[Don't Stop Now]]".<ref name="Howl"/>

On 17 March 2007 the band played a live show at their rehearsal studio in front of around fifty fans, friends and family. The performance was streamed live as a [[webcast]]. The two-and-a-half-hour set included some new tracks, including "Silent House" co-written by Finn with the [[Dixie Chicks]]. A concert onboard ''[[The Thekla]]'', moored in [[Bristol]], followed on 19 March. Crowded House played at the Marquee Theatre in Tempe, Arizona on 26 April as a warm-up for their appearance at the [[Coachella Festival]] on 29 April in [[Indio, California]]. They played at the Australian [[Live Earth concert, Sydney|Live Earth]] concert in Sydney on 7 July. The next day, Finn and Seymour were interviewed on ''[[Rove Live]]'' and the band, with Hart and Sherrod, performed "Don't Stop Now" to promote the new album, which was titled ''Time on Earth''. The single was a minor hit in Australia<ref name="AusCharts"/> and the UK.<ref name="UKCharts"/> The album was released worldwide in June and July. It topped the album chart in New Zealand<ref name="NZCharts"/> and made number 2 in Australia<ref name="AusCharts"/> and number 3 in the UK.<ref name="UKCharts"/>

On 6 December 2008 Crowded House played the [[Homebake]] festival in Sydney, with warm up gigs at small venues in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney. For these shows the band were augmented by multi-instrumentalist [[Don McGlashan]] and Neil's younger son, Elroy Finn, on guitar. On 14 March 2009 the band joined Neil's older son, Liam Finn, on stage for three songs at the [[Sound Relief]] concert in Melbourne.

Crowded House began recording their follow-up to ''Time on Earth'' in April 2009, at Finn's own [[Roundhead Studios]]. The album, ''[[Intriguer]]'', was produced by [[Jim Scott (producer)|Jim Scott]] who had worked on ''[[The Sun Came Out]]'' by Neil's 7 Worlds Collide project. In August 2009, Finn travelled to Los Angeles to record some overdubs at Jim Scott's Los Angeles studio before they began mixing tracks. The album was released in June 2010, in time for the band's appearance at the [[West Coast Blues & Roots Festival]] near [[Perth]]. Finn stated that the album contains some, "Unexpected twists and turns" and some songs that, "Sound like nothing we've done before."<ref>Thompson, Jody [http://www.spinnermusic.co.uk/2010/04/21/crowded-house-new-album-intriguer/ "Crowded House Return With New Album Intriguer"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100900/http://www.spinnermusic.co.uk/2010/04/21/crowded-house-new-album-intriguer/ |date=28 July 2011 }} spinnermusic.co.uk – 21 April 2010</ref> ''Intriguer'' topped the Australian album chart,<ref name="AusCharts"/> reached number 3 in New Zealand<ref name="NZCharts"/> and number 12 in the UK.<ref name="UKCharts"/>

Crowded House undertook an extensive world tour in 2010 in support of ''Intriguer''. This was the first album where the band regularly interacted with fans via the internet on their own re-launched website. The band sold recordings of the shows on the ''Intriguer'' tour on [[USB flash drive]]s and made individual live tracks available for free download.

A new compilation album, ''[[The Very Very Best of Crowded House]]'', was released in October 2010 to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/crowded-houses-top-hits-and-fan-favorites-gathered-for-the-very-very-best-of-crowded-house-to-be-released-october-26-by-capitolemi-101974448.html "Crowded House's Top Hits and Fan Favorites Gathered for 'The Very Very Best Of Crowded House,' to be Released 26 October by Capitol/EMI"] [[PR Newswire]] – 1 September 2010</ref> It includes 19 of the band's greatest hits and is also available in a box set with a 25 track DVD of their music videos. A deluxe digital version, available for download only, has 32 tracks including a rare 1987 live recording of the band's version of the [[Hunters & Collectors]] song "[[Throw Your Arms Around Me]]". No mention of this album has been made on the band's official website or Twitter page, which suggests that they are not involved with its release.

Following the success of the album ''She Will Have Her Way'' in 2005, a second album of cover versions of Finn Brothers songs (including Crowded House songs) was released on 12 November 2010. Entitled ''[[He Will Have His Way]]'', all tracks are performed by Australasian male artists.<ref name=TSFWO>Kara, [http://www.theinsoundfromwayout.com/2010/10/hwhhw/ "He Will Have His Way: The Songs of Tim & Neil Finn – out 12 November"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717010302/http://www.theinsoundfromwayout.com/2010/10/hwhhw/ |date=17 July 2011 }} ''The Sound From Way Out'' – 26 October 2010</ref>

Former Crowded House drummer [[Peter Jones (drummer)|Peter Jones]] died from brain cancer on 18 May 2012, aged 49.

In September 2015, the song "Help is Coming" from the ''[[Afterglow (Crowded House album)|Afterglow]]'' album, was released as a download and limited edition 7" single to raise money for the charity [[Save the Children]]. The B-side, "Anthem", was a previously unreleased track, recorded at the same demo session as "Help is Coming" in 1995, with vocals added in 2015. [[Peter Jones (drummer)|Peter Jones]] plays drums on both songs. The money will be used to provide shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene for refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. Neil Finn said of "Help Is Coming"..."It was always a song about refugees, even if at the time I was thinking about the immigrants setting off on ships from Europe to America, looking for a better life for their families. There is such a huge scale and urgency to the current refugee crises that barely a day goes by without some crushing image or news account to confront us.

==Style==
===Songwriting and musical influences===
As the primary songwriter for the band, Neil Finn has always set the tone for the band's sound. [[AllMusic]] said that Finn "has consistently proven his knack for crafting high-quality songs that combine irresistible melodies with meticulous lyrical detail."<ref>Woodstra, Chris [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p76135|pure_url=yes}} "Neil Finn > Biography"] AllMusic</ref> Neil's brother Tim was an early and important musical influence. Neil first saw Tim play with Split Enz in 1972, and said "that performance and those first songs made a lasting impression on me."<ref>[http://www.mushroommusic.com.au/songwriters/78/finn-neil "Neil Finn > Biography"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221050636/http://mushroommusic.com.au/songwriters/78/finn-neil |date=21 February 2011 }} ''[[Mushroom Records|Mushroom Music Publishing]]''</ref> His mother was another significant musical influence, encouraging him to listen to a variety of genres, including [[Irish folk music]] and [[Māori music]]. She would play piano at family parties and encourage Neil and Tim to accompany her.

===Album covers, costumes and set design===
Bassist Nick Seymour, who is also an artist, designed or co-designed all of the band's album covers and interior artwork. He also designed some of the costumes worn by the group, notably those from the cover of the group's debut album ''Crowded House''. Seymour collaborated with Finn and Hester on the set design of some of their early music videos, including "Don't Dream It's Over" and "Better Be Home Soon". Since the band reunited, Seymour has again designed their album covers.<ref name=denton/>

The majority of the covers for the band's singles were not designed by Seymour. The artwork for "Pineapple Head" was created by [[Reg Mombassa]] of [[Mental As Anything]]. For the first four albums Mombassa and [[Noel Crombie]], who had been the main designer of Split Enz's artwork, assisted Seymour in creating sets and costumes. For the ''Farewell to the World'' concerts Crombie designed the set, while Mombassa and Seymour designed promotional materials and artwork.<ref>Crowded House, ''Farewell to the World'' concert film end credits, released December 1996.</ref>
