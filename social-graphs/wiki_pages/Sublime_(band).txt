'''Sublime''' is an American [[ska]] [[Punk rock|punk]] band from [[Long Beach, California]], that plays a mix of [[ska]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[reggae]]. Formed in 1988,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Sublime-614/2009/6/members-meet-become-sublime.htm |title=Sublime: How did the members meet and become sublime?, hogans heroes, roots of creation |publisher=En.allexperts.com |access-date=2010-06-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707113446/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Sublime-614/2009/6/members-meet-become-sublime.htm |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> the band's original lineup consisted of [[Bradley Nowell]] (vocals and guitar), [[Eric Wilson (bassist)|Eric Wilson]] (bass), and [[Bud Gaugh]] (drums). Lou Dog, Nowell's [[Dalmatian (dog)|dalmatian]], was the [[mascot]] of the band. Nowell died of a [[heroin]] [[overdose]] in 1996, resulting in the band's breakup. In 1997, songs such as "[[What I Got]]", "[[Santeria (song)|Santeria]]", "[[Wrong Way]]", "[[Doin' Time]]", and "[[April 29, 1992 (Miami)]]" were released to U.S. radio.<ref name="amg">Bush, John.

Sublime released three studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums, three EPs, and one box set. Although their first two albums—''[[40oz. to Freedom]]'' (1992) and ''[[Robbin' the Hood]]'' (1994)—were slightly popular in the United States, Sublime did not experience major commercial success until 1996 with their [[Sublime (album)|self-titled third album]], released two months after Nowell's death. Peaking at No. 13 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], it spawned the hit single "[[What I Got]]", which reached number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Airplay|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. As of 2009, the band has sold over 17 million albums worldwide,<ref>{{cite web |last=Montgomery |first=James |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1620567/20090901/sublime.jhtml |title=Sublime Reunion: New Lead Singer, Same Old Dysfunction - News Story &#124; Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2009-09-02 |access-date=2010-06-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909064601/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1620567/20090901/sublime.jhtml |archive-date=September 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> including about ten million in the U.S. alone.

In 2023, Gaugh rejoined Wilson and Bradley Nowell's son [[Jakob Nowell|Jakob]] to reform Sublime, along with helping on Jakob's ska-punk/alternative rock band, 'Jakobs Castle'.

==History==
===1988–1991: Early career===
Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh were childhood friends. Having grown up in the same Long Beach neighborhood, Eric's father, Billy Wilson taught Gaugh how to read music and play the drums. Gaugh and Wilson, together with future Sublime manager [[Michael Happoldt]], formed a three-piece punk band called The Juice Bros during their high school years. About this time, Bradley Nowell, who had recently dropped out of the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], joined the band. Nowell helped introduce Gaugh and Wilson (who at the time listened exclusively to [[punk rock]]) to [[reggae]] and [[ska]].<ref name="Time">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984977-1,00.html|title=Sublime: When the Music's Over|last=Farley|first=Christopher John|date=1996-08-12|access-date=2011-01-31|magazine=Time|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629034523/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984977-1,00.html|archive-date=June 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Sublime played its first gig on [[Independence Day (United States)|the 4th of July]], 1988 on the Long Beach Peninsula in Belmont Shore. Music venues were skeptical of the band's eclectic musical fusion and many refused to book the band.  In response, the band created their own music label, [[Skunk Records]], and told venues that they were "Skunk Records recording artists", which helped the band seem more accomplished and subsequently book more shows.<ref name="Time" /> For the next several years, the group focused primarily on playing at parties and small clubs throughout [[Southern California]] with local ska bands such as Smokestacks, [[No Doubt]], and Skeletones. The trio recorded a few songs and put forth a number of short [[Demo (music)|demos]].

In February 1990, Nowell adopted an abused [[Dalmatian (dog)|dalmatian]] puppy from a shelter and named him "Louie" after his grandfather.<ref name="VH1behindthemusic" /> Louie Nowell, King Louie, or "Lou Dog", as he was called, became something of a mascot for the band. Lou Dog was often allowed to wander around the stage during the band's concert performances.

One of Sublime's early club venues in 1990 was at a downtown club in Long Beach called Toe Jam. This club was owned and operated by David Rice, James Walker, Jason Burch, and Jeff King. A private party was held in February 1991 at Toe Jam for one of the owners. Special thanks can be found for Toe Jam and the owners on the back of the later produced album, ''40oz. to Freedom''.

In late 1990, music student [[Michael Happoldt|Michael "Miguel" Happoldt]] approached the band, offering to let them record in the studio at the school where Happoldt was studying. The band enthusiastically agreed and trespassed into the school at night, where they recorded from midnight to seven in the morning.<ref name="VH1behindthemusic">{{cite episode |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/behind_the_music/episode.jhtml?episodeID=55758 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304130700/http://www.vh1.com/shows/behind_the_music/episode.jhtml?episodeID=55758 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2010 |title=Sublime | series = [[Behind the Music]] | network = [[VH1]] | airdate = 2001-05-30 | access-date=2011-02-02}}</ref> The recording session resulted in the popular cassette tape called ''Jah Won't Pay the Bills'', which was then released in 1991 and featured songs that would appear on the band's future albums. The tape helped the band gain a grassroots following throughout southern California.<ref name="VH1behindthemusic" />

===1992–1995: ''40oz. to Freedom'' and ''Robbin' the Hood''===
Eventually, Sublime developed a large following in California. After focusing on live shows, the band released ''[[40oz. to Freedom]]'' in 1992 under Nowell's label, [[Skunk Records]]. The record established Sublime's blend of [[ska]], [[reggae]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[surf rock]], and [[hip-hop music|hip hop]], and helped to further strengthen the group's growing California following. Initially being sold exclusively at their live shows, the album became widely known in the [[greater Los Angeles area]] after rock radio station [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] began playing the song "[[Date Rape (song)|Date Rape]]". By 1996, ''40oz. to Freedom'' had sold more than 209,000 units, beating the future self-titled album's running total of 145,000 unit sales.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Reece|first1=Doug|title=MCA's Sublime Climbs Up From Grass Roots|volume=180|agency=Billboard: The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|issue=40|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=October 5, 1996}}</ref>

In 1992/1993, Sublime was briefly signed to Danny Holloway's True Sound imprint.<ref name="amg" /> However, the band stayed on Skunk Records. In June 1994, they were signed to the label Gasoline Alley of [[MCA Records]] by Jon Phillips who subsequently became Sublime's manager. Sublime released their second album ''[[Robbin' the Hood]]'' in 1994, an experimental effort with its diffuse mixture of rock, rap, [[spoken-word]] nonsense, and folk-leaning acoustic home recordings. ''Robbin' the Hood'' was a commercial failure. The band toured extensively throughout 1994–1995, their popularity increasing gradually beyond the West Coast as "Date Rape" began earning radio play. In 1995, the band co-headlined the inaugural nationwide [[Vans Warped Tour]]. The band was eventually asked to leave the tour for a week due to unruly behavior of Sublime guests and Lou Dog biting four different individuals.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Kemp|first1=Mark|title=Life After Death|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=1997-12-25|issue=776/777|page=104}}</ref> Gaugh reflected on the experience: "Basically, our daily regimen was wake up, drink, drink more, play, and then drink a lot more. We'd call people names. Nobody got our sense of humor. Then we brought the dog out and he bit a few skaters, and that was the last straw."<ref name="Time" /> After the Warped Tour and the subsequent Three Ring Circus Tour, the band was pressured to begin producing new studio material as a follow-up to ''Robbin' the Hood''.

===1996: Nowell's death, self-titled final album, and breakup===
In early 1996, Sublime headlined the first [[SnoCore Tour]]. In February, they began recording what would comprise the band's [[Sublime (album)|self-titled third record]] and their major label debut album. Sublime completed it before Nowell died of a [[heroin]] overdose on May 25, 1996, at a motel in San Francisco, California,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1996/05/27/NEWS3710.dtl |title=Band's singer found dead in motel |publisher=sfgate.com |date=1996-05-27 |access-date=2012-02-14 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826165315/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fe%2Fa%2F1996%2F05%2F27%2FNEWS3710.dtl |archive-date=August 26, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> the day after their last live show in Petaluma, California (May 24, 1996), and two months prior to the release of the self-titled album.

Jason Westfall, one of Sublime's managers, was quoted as saying that the surviving members of the band would not continue to perform and record under the "Sublime" name: "Just like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], Sublime died when Brad died."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://Agaric40.tripod.com/info/lb-pt.html |title=Hometown paper talks about Brad |publisher=Agaric40.tripod.com |date=1996-05-27 |access-date=2011-10-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090818024341/http://agaric40.tripod.com/info/lb-pt.html |archive-date=August 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sublime Singer Brad Nowell Dead At 28 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/507671/sublime-singer-brad-nowell-dead-at-28/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923013416/http://www.mtv.com/news/507671/sublime-singer-brad-nowell-dead-at-28/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 23, 2016 |website=MTV.com |access-date=10 April 2020 |date=29 May 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Yagi |first1=Anuhea |title=Sublime With Rome Tries to Recapture the Magic |url=https://mauitime.com/culture/sublime-with-rome-tries-to-recapture-the-magic/ |access-date=10 April 2020 |work=Maui Time |date=18 November 2010}}</ref>

===1997–2023: Post-mortem===
A number of posthumous releases followed, among them ''[[Second-hand Smoke (album)|Second-Hand Smoke]]'' in 1997 and both ''[[Stand by Your Van]]'' and ''[[Sublime Acoustic: Bradley Nowell & Friends]]'' in 1998.<ref name="amg" /> ''[[Second-hand Smoke (album)|Second-Hand Smoke]]'', produced by Michael "Miguel" Happoldt, is described as an "assemblage of leftovers, remixes and rarities" that hints at possible musical directions Sublime may have pursued if Nowell had not died.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Considine|first1=J.D.|title=Sublime's 'Second-Hand' shows the promise that went up in smoke: [FINAL Edition]|agency=The Sun|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company LLC|date=January 8, 1988}}</ref> By the release of their ''[[Greatest Hits (Sublime album)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation in 1999, the band had released as many albums after Nowell's death as during his lifetime.<ref>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

On June 16, 2012, the group reunited to give a show at the D-Tox Rockfest in [[Montebello, Quebec]] (under the [[Sublime with Rome]] moniker).

Nowell's widow, Troy Holmes Nowell, has negotiated with the band's record label and entertainment [[impresario]] Paul Ruffino to produce a documentary film about Sublime's successful association with Brad Nowell; the project was delayed until Mr. Nowell's estate could be settled.

In October 1997, Troy and singer [[Courtney Love]] collaborated with the advocacy group [[Partnership for a Drug-Free America]] on a series of public service announcements for television intended to de-glamorize drug use and help disassociate it from the music industry.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rosen |first=Craig |date=November 8, 1997 |title=Musicians, Anti-Drug Group Team to Deglamorize Usage Via PSAs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QkEAAAAMBAJ&dq=musicians%2C+Anti-Drug+Group+Team+to+Deglamorize+Usage+Via+PSAs&pg=PA12 |website=Billboard.com |publisher=Billboard |id=}}</ref>

Following Sublime's dissolution, former members Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh founded the [[Long Beach Dub Allstars]] in 1997, which also included many frequent Sublime contributors such as Michael "Miguel" Happoldt (former member of [[The Ziggens]]), [[Marshall Goodman]] "Ras MG" (former Sublime member), and [[Todd Forman]] (3rd Alley). LBDAS disbanded in 2002, due to several members of the band breaking a no-drug vow they had taken.

Bud Gaugh joined the short-lived [[Eyes Adrift]], a [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] consisting of Bud on drums, [[Krist Novoselic]] (of Nirvana) on bass, and [[Curt Kirkwood]] (of the [[Meat Puppets]]) on guitar and lead vocals. On September 24, 2002, Eyes Adrift released their only album, a self-titled LP consisting of 12 songs. They released one single from the CD, entitled "Alaska".

In 2005, [[No Doubt]] bassist [[Tony Kanal]], who had performed with the group, recollected on their career, saying "They made a sound that somehow fused rock, reggae, punk and hip-hop in a way that was seamless and credible, bound together by the undeniable soul of Brad Nowell's voice." He was joined by other members of bands that had performed with Sublime, such as [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], punk progenitor [[Mike Watt]], Philadelphia neo-bluesman [[G Love]], Hawai'i beachcomber [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], Latin-rock eclecticists [[Ozomatli]], and progressive hip-hop figures [[Michael Franti]] and [[Gift of Gab (rapper)|Gift of Gab]] on "Look at All the Love We Found: A Tribute to Sublime," to donate money to help support artists with substance abuse problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = POP EYE; Long live the spirit of Sublime: [HOME EDITION]|last = Hochman|first = Steve|date = March 20, 2005|journal = Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

On June 5, 2013, it was announced that Sublime would be celebrating the 25th anniversary of their first show (which happened on July 4, 1988) with the release of their first live album/concert film. The album, titled ''[[3 Ring Circus - Live at The Palace]]'', features footage recorded at a 1995 show in Hollywood and was released on June 18, 2013. The deluxe version features extras including a poster, backstage pass and a separate concert film of the band's performance recorded in 1995 at the Las Palmas Theatre.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130703032623/http://www.987fm.com/pages/harms.html?article=11359765]"Sublime Celebrates 25th Anniversary In 2013 With Live CD/DVD" 987fm.com. 2013-06-05.

In August 2021, Sublime announced a special limited 25th anniversary edition [[cassette tape]] of their third (and final) acclaimed self-titled album. Cassettes were released on October 1, 2021, and include classics like "Santeria", "What I Got", "Doin' Time", and "Wrong Way".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://surfdog.com/sublime-25th-anniversary-cassette-now-available-for-pre-order/|title = Sublime 25th Anniversary Cassette Now Available for Pre-Order!|date = August 13, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shop.udiscovermusic.com/products/sublime-sublime-25th-anniversary-cassette|title = Sublime (25th Anniversary) Cassette}}</ref>

Also in 2021, Sublime created a remix project, ''Sublime Meets Scientist & Mad Professor Inna L.B.C.'', which was released digitally on June 12.

[[Bob Marley]] and associated Jamaican reggae artists [[The Wailers]] and [[Peter Tosh]] feature prominently in Sublime's songs, as do other Jamaican reggae and [[dancehall]] artists such as [[Born Jamericans]], [[Toots & the Maytals]], [[The Melodians]], [[Wayne Smith (musician)|Wayne Smith]], [[Tenor Saw]], [[Frankie Paul]], [[The Wailing Souls]], [[Barrington Levy]], [[Half Pint]], and [[Yellowman]].

Sublime was also heavily influenced by the 1980s and 1990s hip-hop and rap scene of [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]], alluding to or borrowing from such acts as [[N.W.A]] and [[Eazy-E]] (who died 14 months before Nowell), [[Beastie Boys]], [[Just-Ice]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] and [[Flavor Flav]], [[KRS-One]], [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[Too $hort]], and [[Mobb Deep]], as well as the Philadelphia-based rapper [[Steady B]] and [[Texas]] hip-hop group The [[Geto Boys]].<ref name="stp" />

The southern California [[Heavy metal music|metal]], [[surf rock]], and [[Punk rock|punk]] scene influencing Sublime includes [[Big Drill Car]] (who were thanked in the first two albums), [[The Ziggens]], [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[Descendents (band)|Descendents]], [[Bad Religion]], [[The Bel-Airs]], [[Butthole Surfers]], and [[Secret Hate]], as well as new wave/fusion band [[Fishbone]]. Sublime was also influenced by Washington, D.C. hardcore acts such as [[Minor Threat]], [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]] (who were also thanked in the first album), and [[Bad Brains]]. The band also referenced popular West Coast rock bands and artists like [[Grateful Dead]], [[The Doors]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], sixties underground and counter-culture icon [[Frank Zappa]], and even Swedish pop band [[ABBA]].<ref name="stp" />

A few references are made to [[funk]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[Soul music|soul]] artists and bands such as [[James Brown]], the [[Ohio Players]], and [[Aswad (band)|Aswad]], as well as a smattering of Irish, Scottish, and English bands like [[Boomtown Rats]], the ska band [[The Specials]], and [[Primal Scream]].

Sublime's music was highlighted by bass-driven grooves, reggae rhythms, elaborately cadenced rhyme schemes, and transitions between paces and styles throughout a given song, sometimes alternating between thrash punk, ska, and reggae within the same song (see "Seed"). Their music often contains psychedelic, harmonic minor-based or [[blues]]y guitar solos, rhythmically improvised bass solos or dub-lines, [[Scratching|turntable scratching]], rolling drum transitions, and heavy bass lines. They are known for being one of the first and most influential [[reggae fusion]] bands.

==Influence and legacy==

{{refimprove|1=section|date=May 2023}}

With the mainstream success of their self-titled album, going five times platinum and earning worldwide airplay, Sublime's influence persists to this day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdsociety.com/new-stylee-the-return-of-sublime/ |title=New Style: The Return of Sublime – Latest Nerdy Pop Culture News |publisher=Nerdsociety.com |date=2009-11-03 |access-date=2011-03-03 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714163713/http://www.nerdsociety.com/new-stylee-the-return-of-sublime/ |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Their signature sound and their songs are often associated with the beach and coastal areas of [[Southern California]], such as [[San Diego]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]], and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] as well as areas of [[Northern California]] like [[Eureka, California|Eureka]]. Over two decades after Nowell's death and the band's breakup, Sublime remains immensely popular throughout [[North America]], especially in its state of origin, California.

Sublime's songs have been featured via soundtrack in a variety of media. Los Angeles [[alternative rock]] radio station [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] has listed Sublime at No.&nbsp;3 in their annual "Top 106.7 biggest KROQ bands of all time" list for the past six years in a row,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lineup.sunfest.com/band/sublime-with-rome |title=Sublime with Rome |publisher=sunfest.com |access-date=November 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110161621/http://lineup.sunfest.com/band/sublime-with-rome |archive-date=November 10, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> behind [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kroq-data.com/kroqnow/topbands07/index.asp |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20071011153732/http://kroq-data.com//kroqnow//topbands07//index.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-11 |title=KROQ |date=2008-04-12 |access-date=2011-10-15 }}</ref> and No.&nbsp;81 at the "Top 166 Artists of 1980–2008" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiohitlist.com/KROQ/KROQ-top-artists.htm |title=The KROQ Top Artists of 1980-2008 |publisher=Radiohitlist.com |access-date=2011-10-15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928182322/http://www.radiohitlist.com/KROQ/KROQ-top-artists.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

With over 17 million units sold worldwide, Sublime is one of the most successful and "powerfully moving" ska-punk acts of all time influencing many modern reggae and ska acts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2024}}

A tribute band known as [[Badfish]], after one of their songs, was formed. In 2019 [[Lana Del Rey]] created a cover of "Doin Time", boosting the band's name recognition. The music video has over 160 million views on YouTube. 

==Other projects==
In March 2017, for the 25th anniversary of their seminal debut album ''40oz. to Freedom'', Sublime announced that they teamed up with [[AleSmith Brewing Company]] to release a Mexican-style lager initially dubbed "40oz. to Freedom". A limited edition of the batch of beer was bottled in 40-ounce containers and sold through the San Diego brewery.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/sublime-to-mark-25th-anniversary-with-reissue-documentary-w472898|title=Sublime to Mark 25th Anniversary With Reissue, Authorized Documentary|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-03-29|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330080448/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/sublime-to-mark-25th-anniversary-with-reissue-documentary-w472898|archive-date=March 30, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The entire run of 40-ounce bottles sold out in five minutes. The cans, which feature Sublime's trademark sun design created by artist [[Opie Ortiz]], were headed toward 19 states as of September 14, 2017. AleSmith was on pace to ship 3,400 barrels of the beer (renamed to Sublime Mexican Lager) by December 31, which is 8.5% of AleSmith's 40,000 barrels of total production for 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-ska-punk-band-sublime-brought-40-ounce-mexican-lager-to-craft-beer-2017-09-14|title=How ska-punk band Sublime brought 40-ounce Mexican lager to craft beer|last=Notte|first=Jason|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330080312/https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-ska-punk-band-sublime-brought-40-ounce-mexican-lager-to-craft-beer-2017-09-14|archive-date=March 30, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2017, Brad's sister Kellie Nowell, along with her father Jim "Papa" Nowell, started the Nowell Family Foundation and Bradley's House, a drug treatment facility focused on musicians in recovery. Their message is "If there's a will, there's a way out."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2020/12/brad-nowell-sublime-bradleys-house-kellie-nowell-interview/#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20along%20with%20her,focused%20on%20musicians%20in%20recovery.|title = Brad Nowell's Family Keeps Hope Alive for Sublime Frontman's Rehab Facility|date = December 21, 2020}}</ref> The foundation's goal is to have a six-bedroom house as a rehab facility in [[Laguna Beach, California]], that will "supply an affordable 90-day program that pairs music-based social curriculum with help from certified drug treatment professionals along with on-site [[yoga]] and a gym."

As the foundation's executive director, Kellie worked to turn the project into a reality by hiring certified staff and developing new rehabilitation programs. Many musicians and bands including [[Pepper (band)|Pepper]], [[O.A.R.]] and Jim Lindburg of [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] who were close to Bradley or were inspired by his music chipped in with benefit concerts.

On September 4, 2020, a compilation album of Sublime cover songs, ''The House That Bradley Built'', was released on Pepper's label, LAW Records. The compilation was to help raise money for the Nowell Family Foundation's [[opioid]] recovery project for Bradley's House. The idea for the compilation was by LAW Records co-founders, Paul Milbury and Yesod Williams (drummer for Pepper), who both came to Kellie with the idea. The compilation featured never-before-released acoustic covers from the catalogue of Bradley's band, Sublime, performed by 20-plus punk and reggae bands.

Also in 2020, Sublime teamed up with [[Z2 Comics]] to create "The Official Sublime [[graphic novel]]" called "$5.00 at the Door". It comes in hardcover or softcover with an exclusive picture disc vinyl, limited edition Lou Dog vinyl figure, and more through three different bundles. The comic is a "heartfelt anthology of Sublime legends brought to life" from playing backyard parties and selling cassette tapes out of their van to a platinum-selling multi-genre busting band. It was written by Ryan Cady (from [[Green Lantern]] comic) with illustrations by Audrey Mok, Alex Diotto, Hayden Sherman, Logan Faeber, Bill Masuku, Robert Ahmad, and Julianne Griep. "Featuring brand-new cover artwork by Sublime family members [[Opie Ortiz]] and DJ Product ©1969!"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://z2comics.com/products/sublime-5-at-the-door-graphic-novel|title = Sublime: $5 at the Door (Official Graphic Novel)}}</ref>

In October 2021, Sublime collaborated with [[Tempe, Arizona]]'s Dixxon Flannel Company on a Sublime [[flannel shirt]]. To celebrate 30 years of the band's [[Extended play|EP]], ''Jah Won't Pay the Bills'', the "Sublime Flannel" features a gray, black, and green plaid pattern.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dixxon.com/collections/flannels/products/sublime-flannel|title = Sublime Flannel}}</ref>
