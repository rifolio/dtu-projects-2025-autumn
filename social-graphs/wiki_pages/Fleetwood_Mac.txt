'''Fleetwood Mac''' <!--do not change this -->are<!-- to "were" (or "was") without a cited statement from the members of the band--> a British-American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1967 by singer and guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]. Green named the band by combining the surnames of drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]] and bassist [[John McVie]], who have remained with the band throughout its many line-up changes. Fleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling musical acts]].

Primarily a [[British blues]] band in their early years, Fleetwood Mac achieved a UK number one single in 1968 with the instrumental "[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]" and had other UK top ten hits with "[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]", "[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]" (both 1969), and "[[The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)]]" (1970). Green left the band in May 1970 and McVie's wife, [[Christine McVie]], joined as an official member on vocals and keyboards two months later, having previously contributed to the band as a session musician. Other key members during the band's early years were [[Jeremy Spencer]], [[Danny Kirwan]], and [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]]. By the end of 1974, these members had departed, which left the band without a guitarist and male singer. While Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard the American [[folk rock]] duo [[Buckingham Nicks]], consisting of guitarist and singer [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and singer [[Stevie Nicks]]. In December 1974, he asked Buckingham to join Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also join. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more [[pop rock]] sound, and their 1975 album ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'' topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the United States. Their next album, ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977), reached number one in multiple countries around the world and won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1978.

The line-up remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham left in 1987, he was replaced by [[Billy Burnette]] and [[Rick Vito]], although Vito left in 1990 along with Nicks. A 1993 one-off performance for the [[First inauguration of Bill Clinton|first inauguration of President Bill Clinton]] reunited the classic 1974–1987 line-up for the first time in six years. A full-scale reunion took place four years later, and Fleetwood Mac released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' (1997), a live album marking the 20th anniversary of ''Rumours'' and the band's 30th anniversary. Christine McVie left in 1998 after the completion of The Dance Tour, but rejoined in 2014 for their [[On With the Show Tour]]. Fleetwood Mac released their final studio album, ''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'', in 2003. In 2018, Buckingham was fired and replaced by [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], formerly of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and [[Neil Finn]] of [[Split Enz]] and [[Crowded House]]. After Christine McVie's death in 2022, Nicks said in 2024 that the band would not continue without her.

In 1979, Fleetwood Mac were honoured with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 1998, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and received the [[Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music]]. In 2018, Fleetwood Mac received the [[MusiCares Person of the Year]] award from [[the Recording Academy]] in recognition of their artistic achievement in the [[music industry]] and dedication to [[philanthropy]].

The Bluesbreakers then consisted of Green, Fleetwood, [[John McVie]] and Mayall. Mayall gave Green free recording time as a gift, which Fleetwood, McVie and Green used to record five songs. The fifth song was an instrumental that Green named after the rhythm section, "Fleetwood Mac" ("Mac" being short for McVie).<ref name="Definitive History">{{Cite book|title=Fleetwood Mac: The Definitive History|last=Evans|first=Mike|publisher=Sterling|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4027-8630-3|location=New York|pages=24, 28–29, 266–267}}</ref>

Soon after this, Green suggested to Fleetwood that they form a new band. The pair wanted McVie on bass guitar and named the band "Fleetwood Mac" to entice him, but McVie opted to keep his steady income with Mayall rather than take a risk with a new band. In the meantime, Green and Fleetwood teamed up with slide guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]] and bassist [[Bob Brunning]]. Brunning was in the band on the understanding that he would leave if McVie agreed to join.<ref name="Definitive History"/> The band made its debut on Sunday 13 August 1967 at the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]] (a forerunner of [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|the Reading Festival]]), billed as "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer".

Fleetwood Mac's [[Fleetwood Mac (1968 album)|self-titled debut album]] was released by the [[Blue Horizon (record label)|Blue Horizon]] label in February 1968.

The band's second studio album, ''[[Mr. Wonderful (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mr. Wonderful]]'', was released in August 1968.

[[File:Fleetwood Mac Danny Kirwan 11.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[Danny Kirwan]], 18 March 1970]]
Shortly after the release of ''Mr. Wonderful'', 18-year-old guitarist [[Danny Kirwan]] joined the band, making Fleetwood Mac a five-piece band with three guitarists. Kirwan was in the South London blues trio Boilerhouse with Trevor Stevens (bass) and Dave Terrey (drums).<ref>{{cite book|last=Rawlings|first=Terry|title=Then, now and rare British Beat 1960–1969|year=2002|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-9094-8|page=77}}</ref> Green and Fleetwood had watched Boilerhouse rehearse in a basement boiler-room, and Green had been so impressed that he invited the band to play support slots for Fleetwood Mac. Green wanted Boilerhouse to become a professional band, but Stevens and Terrey were not prepared to turn professional, so Green tried to find another rhythm section for Kirwan by placing an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. There were over 300 applicants, but when Green and Fleetwood ran auditions at the Nag's Head in Battersea (home of the [[Mike Vernon (producer)|Mike Vernon]]'s [[Blue Horizon (record label)|Blue Horizon]] Club) the hard-to-please Green could not find anyone good enough. Instead, Fleetwood invited Kirwan to join Fleetwood Mac as a third guitarist.<ref name="Brunning p18" />

In November 1968, with Kirwan in the band, they released their first number-one single in Europe, "[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]", an instrumental with lead guitar by both Green and Kirwan.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Fleetwood Mac Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/fleetwood-mac/biography|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=28 August 2017|archive-date=11 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711154402/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/fleetwood-mac/biography|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Inc.1969">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KygEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4 |title=Sire Europe – Hopping on Deals |date=24 May 1969 |pages=4– |issn=0006-2510 |access-date=13 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208142730/https://books.google.com/books?id=KygEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4 |archive-date=8 December 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Green said later that the success of "Albatross" was thanks to Kirwan: "If it wasn't for Danny, I would never have had a number one hit record."<ref name="vaudeville">{{cite AV media notes |author=Celmins |title=The Vaudeville Years |title-link=The Vaudeville Years |type=CD booklet notes |year=1998 |publisher=Receiver Records |first=Martin}}</ref> In January 1969, the compilation album ''[[English Rose (album)|English Rose]]'' was released in the US, while a similar compilation album, ''[[The Pious Bird of Good Omen]],'' was released in the UK in August.

On tour in the US in January 1969, the band recorded ''[[Fleetwood Mac in Chicago]]'' (released in December as a double album) at the soon-to-close [[Chess Records]] Studio with some of the blues legends of Chicago, including [[Willie Dixon]], [[Buddy Guy]] and [[Otis Spann]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hoekstra |first=Dave |date=20 January 2023 |title=Chess Match: When Fleetwood Mac Spent a Day Recording with Legends of the Chicago Blues in 1969, Jeff Lowenthal Caught the Whole Thing on Film |website=Newcity Music |url=https://music.newcity.com/2023/01/20/chess-match-when-fleetwood-mac-spent-a-day-recording-with-legends-of-the-chicago-blues-in-1969-jeff-lowenthal-caught-the-whole-thing-on-film/ |access-date=14 October 2024|language=en-US}}</ref> These were Fleetwood Mac's last all-blues recordings, with the band moving more towards rock. Along with the change of style, the band was also going through label changes. In early 1969, the band left Blue Horizon and signed with [[Immediate Records]], releasing the single "[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]", which became another British and European hit. For the B-side, Spencer fronted Fleetwood Mac as "Earl Vince and the Valiants" and recorded "[[Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonite]]", typifying the more raucous rock 'n' roll side of the band. Immediate Records was in bad shape however, so the band shopped around for a new deal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recordcollectormag.com/articles/loog-ing-number-one|title=Immediate Records – Loog-ing After Number One OO}}</ref> [[The Beatles]] wanted the band on [[Apple Records]],<ref name="NME">{{Cite magazine |date=2 August 1969 |title=Mac Walks Out On Immediate!

Under the wing of Reprise, Fleetwood Mac released their third studio album, ''[[Then Play On]]'', in September 1969.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tiller |first=Joe |date=19 September 2024 |title=Then Play On: Behind Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac Swansong |url=https://www.thisisdig.com/feature/then-play-on-fleetwood-mac-album-story/ |access-date=14 October 2024 |website=Dig! |language=en-US}}</ref> Although the initial pressing of the American release of this album was the same as the British version, it was altered to contain the song "[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]", which featured consistently in live performances from the time of its release through 1997 and again starting in 2009. The songwriting for ''Then Play On'', which saw the band broaden their style away from straight blues, was handled mostly by Green and Kirwan. Spencer did not contribute any songs, but released [[Jeremy Spencer (album)|a solo album]] in early 1970, which featured backing from Fleetwood, McVie and Kirwan.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |title=Jeremy Spencer (selftitled) review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/jeremy-spencer-mw0000849643 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006023617/https://www.allmusic.com/album/jeremy-spencer-mw0000849643 |archive-date=6 October 2019 |access-date=6 October 2019 |website=AllMusic |language=en-us}}</ref>

By 1969, Green was using [[LSD]]. During a European tour towards the end of that year, he experienced a bad acid trip at a hippie commune in Munich. Clifford Davis, the band's manager, singled out this incident as the crucial point in Green's mental decline.<ref>{{cite book| last = Celmins| first = Martin| title = Peter Green: Founder of Fleetwood Mac| year = 1995| publisher = Castle| isbn = 1-898141-13-4}}</ref> He said: "The truth about Peter Green and how he ended up how he did is very simple. We were touring Europe in late 1969. When we were in Germany, Peter told me he had been invited to a party. I knew there were going to be a lot of drugs around and I suggested that he didn't go. But he went anyway and I understand from him that he took what turned out to be very bad, impure LSD. He was never the same again."<ref>Brunning, B. (1998).

Green's last studio recording with Fleetwood Mac was "[[The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)]]" and its B-side, "World in Harmony". The tracks were recorded at Warner-Reprise's studios in Hollywood on the band's third US tour in April 1970, a few weeks before Green left the band.<ref>{{cite book

The remaining four members, Fleetwood, McVie, Spencer and Kirwan, set about working on their next album. In September 1970, Fleetwood Mac released their fourth studio album, ''[[Kiln House]]'', to generally positive reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/kiln-house-mw0000193528|title=Kiln House – Fleetwood Mac &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic|access-date=18 May 2021|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Kirwan's songs on the album moved the band in a melodic rock direction, while Spencer's contributions focused on re-creating the country-tinged "Sun Sound" of the late 1950s. [[Christine McVie|Christine Perfect]], now Christine McVie following her marriage to John McVie, had retired from the music business after one unsuccessful solo album, though she contributed (uncredited) to ''Kiln House'', singing backup vocals and playing keyboards.

In 1971, [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], which now owned Fleetwood Mac's original record company Blue Horizon (except in the US and Canada), released the band's third compilation album, ''[[The Original Fleetwood Mac]]'', containing previously unreleased material from 1967 and 1968.

While on a US tour in February 1971, Jeremy Spencer said he was going out to "get a magazine" but never returned. After several days of frantic searching, the band discovered that Spencer had joined a religious group, the [[Children of God (cult)|Children of God]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Fong-Torres|first1=Ben|title=Fleetwood Mac Stolen Away:Guitarist Jeremy Spencer leaves the band mysteriously just before their American tour|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-stolen-away-19710318|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=18 March 1971|access-date=14 February 2017|archive-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215124210/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-stolen-away-19710318|url-status=live}}</ref> The band were liable for the remaining shows on the tour and asked Peter Green to step in as a replacement. Green brought along his friend [[Nigel Watson]], who played the [[congas]] (twenty-five years later Green and Watson collaborated again to form the [[Peter Green Splinter Group]]), and insisted on playing only new material and none he had written. Green and Watson played the last week of the tour, with a show in San Bernardino on 20 February 1971 being recorded. Green did not want to re-join the band permanently, and a search for a guitarist to replace Spencer began after the tour was completed.<ref>SPL 1046 Stony Plain Records LP "White Skies" 1981 liner notes</ref>

In the summer 1971, the band held auditions for a replacement guitarist at their large country home, "Benifold", which they had jointly bought with their manager Davis for £23,000 ({{Inflation|UK|23000|1970|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) prior to the ''Kiln House'' tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/benifold.htm|title=Benifold|website=fleetwoodmac.net|access-date=8 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927041715/http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/benifold.htm|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> A friend of the band, Judy Wong, recommended her high school friend [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]], who was living in Paris, France, at the time. The band held a few meetings with Welch and decided to hire him, without actually playing with him, after they heard a tape of his songs.<ref name="Brunning, B 1998 p37">Brunning, B (1998): Fleetwood Mac – The First 30 Years. London: Omnibus Press p37</ref>

In September 1971, the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Future Games]]''. As a result of Welch's arrival and Spencer's departure, the album was different from anything they had done previously, with the band moving further away from their blues rock roots towards a more melodic rock style, and vocal harmonies starting to become a key part of their sound. While it became the band's first studio album to miss the charts in the UK, it helped to expand the band's appeal in the United States. In Europe, CBS released Fleetwood Mac's first ''[[Greatest Hits (1971 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in late 1971.

In 1972, six months after the release of ''Future Games'', the band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Bare Trees]]''. Mostly composed by Kirwan, ''Bare Trees'' featured the Welch-penned single "[[Sentimental Lady]]", which would be a much bigger hit for Welch five years later when he re-recorded it for his solo album ''[[French Kiss (Bob Welch album)|French Kiss]]'', backed by Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie. ''Bare Trees'' also featured "Spare Me a Little of Your Love", a Christine McVie song that became a staple of the band's live act throughout the early to mid-1970s.

While the band was doing well in the studio, their tours started to be problematic. By 1972, Kirwan had developed an alcohol dependency and was becoming alienated from Welch and the McVies. In August 1972, before a concert on a US tour, Kirwan smashed his Gibson [[Les Paul Custom]] guitar and refused to go on stage. The band played the show as a quartet, after which Kirwan criticised their performance, and he was subsequently fired from the band.<ref name="brunning">{{cite book | author-link=Bob Brunning | first=Bob | last=Brunning | title=Fleetwood Mac: Behind the Masks | publisher=New English Library | year=1990 | location=London | isbn=0-450-53116-3 | oclc=22242160}}</ref> Fleetwood said later that the pressure had become too much for Kirwan, and he had suffered a breakdown.<ref name="Farber">{{cite web |last1=Farber |first1=Jim |title=Fleetwood Mac's Forgotten Hero |url=https://web.musicaficionado.com/main.html#!/article/fleetwood_macs_forgotten_hero_by_jimfarber |website=Music Aficionado |access-date=5 December 2018 |archive-date=5 August 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170805005553/https://web.musicaficionado.com/main.html%23!/collection/alexlifeson-1457922214322#!/article/fleetwood_macs_forgotten_hero_by_jimfarber |url-status=live }}</ref>

Following Kirwan's departure, the band recruited guitarist [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]] and vocalist [[Dave Walker]], the latter formerly of [[Savoy Brown]] and [[The Idle Race|Idle Race]].<ref name="Music Legends">{{cite web|publisher=Music Legends|url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/dave-walker-interview-black-sabbath/|title=Dave Walker Interview|access-date=6 May 2013|date=30 December 2011|last=Saulnier|first=Jason|archive-date=6 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006223626/http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/dave-walker-interview-black-sabbath/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Bob Weston was well known as a slide guitarist and had known the band from his touring period with [[Long John Baldry]]. Fleetwood Mac also hired Savoy Brown's road manager, John Courage. Fleetwood, the McVies, Welch, Weston and Walker recorded the band's seventh studio album, ''[[Penguin (album)|Penguin]]'', which was released in January 1973. After the subsequent tour, the band fired Walker because they felt his vocal and performance style did not fit well with the rest of the band.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy 45th: Fleetwood Mac, Penguin|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/happy-45th-fleetwood-mac-penguin|website=Rhino|access-date=12 April 2019|archive-date=12 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412185548/https://www.rhino.com/article/happy-45th-fleetwood-mac-penguin|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:mysteryband2.jpg|thumb|Fleetwood Mac in 1973 with [[Christine McVie]], Mick Fleetwood, [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]], John McVie and [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]].]]
The remaining five members carried on and recorded the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Mystery to Me]]''. This album contained Welch's song "[[Hypnotized (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hypnotized]]", which received strong radio airplay. While ''Mystery to Me'' eventually received a Gold certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], personal problems within the band emerged. The McVies' marriage was under a lot of stress, which was aggravated by their constant working with each other and by John McVie's considerable [[alcohol abuse]].<ref>{{cite web|title="McVie, John."

In 1973, Weston had an affair with Fleetwood's wife [[Jenny Boyd]], sister of [[George Harrison]]'s first wife [[Pattie Boyd]]. Fleetwood found out two weeks into a US tour. His devastation led to the band firing Weston and cancelling the remaining 26 dates of the tour.<ref name="Brunning, B 1998 pp52-54">Brunning, B (1998): Fleetwood Mac – The First 30 Years.

The "New Fleetwood Mac" tour began on 16 January 1974 at the [[Syria Mosque]] in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania,<ref name="mervis">{{cite web|url=https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2018/10/29/Fleetwood-Mac-Pittsburgh-Lindsey-Buckingham-PPG-Paints-Arena-fake-band-1974-Syria-Mosque/stories/201810290096 |last=Mervis |first=Scott |title=Will the Real Fleetwood Mac Please Stand Up? |website=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=31 October 2018 |access-date=21 February 2020|archive-date=21 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221173513/https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2018/10/29/Fleetwood-Mac-Pittsburgh-Lindsey-Buckingham-PPG-Paints-Arena-fake-band-1974-Syria-Mosque/stories/201810290096|url-status=live}}</ref> and was initially successful.

The band was turned away from several gigs and the next six shows were pulled by promoters. The band struggled on and played further dates in the face of increasing hostility and heckling. More dates were pulled, the keyboard player quit, and after a concert in [[Edmonton]] where bottles were thrown at the stage, the tour collapsed. The band dissolved and the remainder of the tour was cancelled.<ref name="Brunning, B 1998 p65"/>

The [[lawsuit]] that followed regarding who owned the rights to the name "Fleetwood Mac" put the real Fleetwood Mac on hiatus for almost a year. Their record company, [[Warner Bros. Records]], when appealed to, said they did not know who owned it.<ref name="Brunning, B 1998 p65"/> The dispute was eventually settled out of court, four years later, in what was described as "a reasonable settlement not unfair to either party".<ref name="Brunning, B 1998 p68">Brunning, B (1998): Fleetwood Mac – The First 30 Years.

Nobody from the alternative line-up was ever made a part of the real Fleetwood Mac, although some of them later played in Danny Kirwan's studio band.

===1974: Return of the authentic Fleetwood Mac===
While the fake Fleetwood Mac were on tour, Welch stayed in Los Angeles and connected with entertainment attorneys. He realised that Fleetwood Mac was being neglected by Warner Bros and that they would need to change their base of operation from England to America, to which the rest of the band agreed. The presence of a false Fleetwood Mac had also confused matters. Rock promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] wrote a letter to Warner Bros to convince them that the real Fleetwood Mac was Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Bob Welch. This did not end the legal battle, but the band was able to record as Fleetwood Mac again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/12/listen-to-fleetwood-mac-play-black-magic-woman-in.html|title=Here's the "Real" Fleetwood Mac Playing "Black Magic Woman" in 1974|website=Paste Magazine |date=14 December 2017|language=en|access-date=15 May 2019|archive-date=15 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515033503/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/12/listen-to-fleetwood-mac-play-black-magic-woman-in.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Instead of hiring another manager, Fleetwood Mac, having re-formed, became the only major rock band managed by the artists themselves.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Marsh |first=Dave |date=1978-01-12 |title=Big (Fleetwood) Mac: The 1978 Cover Story |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/big-fleetwood-mac-the-1978-cover-story-242446/ |access-date=2024-06-12 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>

In September 1974, Fleetwood Mac signed a new recording contract with Warner Bros, but remained on the Reprise label. In the same month, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Heroes Are Hard to Find]]''. This was the first time Fleetwood Mac had only one guitarist. While on tour, they briefly added a second keyboardist, Doug Graves, who had been an engineer on ''Heroes Are Hard to Find''. In 1980, Christine McVie said Graves had been there to back her up, but after the first two or three concerts it was decided that she was better off without him: "The band wanted me to expand my role and have a little more freedom, but he didn't play the same way I did."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Doerschuk|first1=Bob|title=Contemporary Keyboard (10/1980), Christine McVie|url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=11&c=2|website=The Blue Letter Archives|access-date=March 14, 2016|archive-date=12 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312173340/http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?c=2&id=11&page=index_v2|url-status=live}}</ref> Keyboard player Robert ("Bobby") Hunt, who had been in the band Head West with Bob Welch in 1970, replaced Graves for the remaining dates on the tour but was not invited to join the band full time. By the time the tour ended (on 5 December 1974 at Cal State University), the ''Heroes'' album had reached a higher position on the American charts than any of the band's previous records.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Fleetwood Mac (2004 Remastered Edition) |title-link=Fleetwood Mac |others=Fleetwood Mac |year=2004 |first=Parke |last=Puterbaugh|page=4|type=Liner Notes |publisher=Reprise Records|location=Los Angeles}}</ref>

===1974–1987: Addition of Buckingham and Nicks, and global success===
In Bob Welch's words, following the ''Heroes are Hard to Find'' tour, "the buzz that the ''Mystery to Me'' band had started to create...[was] gone. I [was] totally exhausted by writing, singing, touring, negotiating, moving, and frankly so [were] Mick, John and Chris. We were ''all'' discouraged that ''Heroes'' [hadn't] done better. Something needs to change, but what? ... There was also a kind of fatigue, anger and bitterness that all the work we had done hadn't really paid off and we were just all sort of shaking our heads saying 'what do we do now' ...

In 1975, the new line-up released their first album together, the self-titled ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'', the band's tenth studio album overall. The album was a breakthrough for the band and became a huge hit, reaching No. 1 in the US and selling over 7 million copies. Among the hit singles from this album were Christine McVie's "[[Over My Head (Fleetwood Mac song)|Over My Head]]" and "[[Say You Love Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Say You Love Me]]" and Stevie Nicks' "[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]", as well as the much-played album track "[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]", a live rendition of which became a hit twenty years later on ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' album.

In 1976, the band was suffering from severe stress. With success came the end of John and Christine McVie's marriage, as well as Buckingham and Nicks's long-term romantic relationship. Fleetwood, meanwhile, was in the midst of divorce proceedings from his wife, Jenny, and had also begun an affair with Nicks.<ref name = "Play On">{{cite book|title=Play On|author1=Fleetwood, Mick |author2=Bozza, Anthony |year=2014|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0316403405}}</ref> The pressure on Fleetwood Mac to release a successful follow-up album, combined with their new-found wealth, led to creative and personal tensions which were allegedly fuelled by high consumption of drugs and alcohol.<ref name="Rock Nuns">{{cite web |last1=Jonze |first1=Tim |title=Fleetwood Mac's Stevie and Christine: 'We were like rock'n'roll nuns' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/12/fleetwood-mac-stevie-nicks-christine-mcvie-nuns |website=The Guardian |date=12 December 2013 |access-date=3 October 2018 |archive-date=4 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004192005/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/12/fleetwood-mac-stevie-nicks-christine-mcvie-nuns |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Fleetwood Mac Rumours trade ad Billboard 1977.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1977 trade ad for ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' with Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]]]]
The band's eleventh studio album, ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (the band's first release on the main Warner label after Reprise was retired and all of its acts were reassigned to the parent label), was released in February 1977. In this album, the band members laid bare the emotional turmoil they were experiencing at the time. ''Rumours'' was critically acclaimed and won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1977. The album generated four top-ten singles: Buckingham's "[[Go Your Own Way]]", Nicks' US No. 1 "[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]", and Christine McVie's "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]" and "[[You Make Loving Fun]]". Buckingham's "[[Second Hand News]]", Nicks' "[[Gold Dust Woman]]", and "[[The Chain]]" (the only song written by all five band members) also received significant radio airplay. By 2003, ''Rumours'' had sold over 19 million copies in the US alone (certified as a [[diamond album]] by the [[RIAA]]) and a total of 40 million copies worldwide, bringing it to eighth on the [[list of best-selling albums]]. Fleetwood Mac supported the album with a lucrative tour.

On 10 October 1979, Fleetwood Mac were honoured for their contributions to the music industry with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6608 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/fleetwood-mac|title=Fleetwood Mac {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=15 June 2016|archive-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812181905/http://www.walkoffame.com/fleetwood-mac|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/fleetwood-mac/|title=Fleetwood Mac|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=15 June 2016|archive-date=3 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603033724/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/fleetwood-mac/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Buckingham convinced Fleetwood to let his work on their next album be more experimental and to be allowed to work on tracks at home before bringing them to the rest of the band in the studio. The result of this, the band's twelfth studio album ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', was a 20-track double album released in 1979. It produced three hit singles: Buckingham's "[[Tusk (song)|Tusk]]" (US No. 8), which featured the [[Spirit of Troy|USC Trojan Marching Band]]; Christine McVie's "[[Think About Me]]" (US No. 20); and Nicks' six-and-a-half minute opus "[[Sara (Fleetwood Mac song)|Sara]]" (US No. 7). "Sara" was cut to four-and-a-half minutes for both the single and the first CD release of the album in the 1980s, but the full version has since been restored on the 1988 ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'', the 1992 ''[[25 Years – The Chain]]'' box set, 2002's ''[[The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac]]'', and the 2004 remaster of ''Tusk''. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions of ''Tusk'', although his playing on the Christine McVie track "Brown Eyes", is not credited on the album.<ref>{{cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac| url=https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet| url-access=registration|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet/page/214 214]| publisher=Avon Books| isbn=9780380716166}}</ref> In an interview in 2019, Fleetwood described ''Tusk'' as his "personal favourite" and said, "Kudos to Lindsey ... for us not doing a replica of ''Rumours''."<ref>{{cite news|work= Independent |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/fleetwood-mac-interview-tour-uk-wembley |title= Fleetwood Mac: We'll Burn in Hell if We Don't Play Glastonbury One Day: Chris Harvey |date= 27 April 2019 |access-date= 30 April 2019 }}</ref>

''Tusk'' sold four million copies worldwide. Fleetwood blamed the album's relative lack of commercial success on the [[RKO General|RKO]] radio chain having played the album in its entirety prior to release, thereby allowing mass home taping.<ref>{{cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac| url=https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet| url-access=registration|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/fleetwoodmylifea00fleet/page/219 219]| publisher=Avon Books| isbn=9780380716166}}</ref>

The band embarked on an 11-month tour to support and promote ''Tusk''. They travelled around the world, including the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, they shared the bill with reggae musician [[Bob Marley]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Stevie Nicks: Visions, Dreams, & Rumours|last=Howe|first=Zoë|pages=146, 154–156|year=2015|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-4683-1066-5|url=https://archive.org/details/stevienicksvisio0000howe/page/156/mode/2up}}</ref> On this world tour, the band recorded music for [[Live (Fleetwood Mac album)|their first live album]], which was released at the end of 1980.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Martoccio |first=Angie |date=20 February 2021|title=Fleetwood Mac Prep Deluxe Edition of 1980 Live Album, Drop 'The Chain' Performance |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/fleetwood-mac-1980-live-album-deluxe-1126278/ |access-date=28 January 2024|magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>

The band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'', was released in 1982. Following 1981 solo albums by Nicks (''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]''), Fleetwood (''[[The Visitor (Mick Fleetwood album)|The Visitor]]''), and Buckingham (''[[Law and Order (album)|Law and Order]]''), there was a return to a more conventional approach. Buckingham had been chided by critics, fellow band members, and music business managers for the lesser commercial success of ''Tusk''. Recorded at [[Château d'Hérouville]] in France and produced by [[Richard Dashut]], ''Mirage'' was an attempt to recapture the huge success of ''Rumours''. Its hits included Christine McVie's "[[Hold Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hold Me]]" and "[[Love in Store]]" (co-written by [[Robbie Patton]] and Jim Recor, respectively), Nicks' "[[Gypsy (Fleetwood Mac song)|Gypsy]]", and Buckingham's "[[Oh Diane]]", which made the Top 10 in the UK. A minor hit was also scored by Buckingham's "[[Can't Go Back (Fleetwood Mac song)|Can't Go Back]]".

In contrast to the [[Tusk Tour]], the band embarked on only a short tour of 18 American cities, with the Los Angeles show being recorded and released on video. They also headlined the first [[US Festival]], on 5 September 1982, for which the band was paid $500,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|500000|1982|r=-3|fmt=c}} in 2024). ''Mirage'' was certified double platinum in the US.

Following ''Mirage'' the band went on hiatus, which allowed members to pursue solo careers. Nicks released two more solo albums (1983's ''[[The Wild Heart (album)|The Wild Heart]]'' and 1985's ''[[Rock a Little]]''). Buckingham issued ''[[Go Insane (album)|Go Insane]]'' in 1984, the same year that Christine McVie made an [[Christine McVie (album)|eponymous album]] (yielding the Top 10 hit "[[Got a Hold on Me]]" and the Top 40 hit "[[Love Will Show Us How]]"). All three became successful in their solo efforts, with Nicks being the most popular. During this period, Fleetwood had filed for bankruptcy, Nicks was admitted to the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] for addiction problems, and John McVie had suffered an addiction-related seizure – all of which were attributed to the lifestyle of excess afforded to them by their worldwide success. It was rumoured that Fleetwood Mac had disbanded, but Buckingham commented that he was unhappy at allowing ''Mirage'' to remain the band's last effort.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=785&c=18 |title=Fleetwood Mac: Return Without Leaving |work=[[Creem]] |last=Kordosh |first=J. |date=September 1987 |access-date=25 October 2011 |archive-date=27 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527211656/http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=785&c=18 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The lineup featuring Fleetwood, the McVies, Buckingham, and Nicks recorded one more album, their fourteenth studio album, ''[[Tango in the Night]]'', in 1987. The recording started off as a Buckingham solo album before becoming a full group project. The album went on to become their best-selling release since ''Rumours'', especially in the UK where it hit No. 1 three times in the following year. The album sold three million copies in the US and contained four hits: Christine McVie's "[[Little Lies]]" and "[[Everywhere (Fleetwood Mac song)|Everywhere]]" ("Little Lies" being co-written with her new husband, Eddy Quintela), [[Sandy Stewart (musician)|Sandy Stewart]] and Nicks' "[[Seven Wonders (song)|Seven Wonders]]", and Buckingham's "[[Big Love (Fleetwood Mac song)|Big Love]]". "[[Family Man (Fleetwood Mac song)|Family Man]]" (Buckingham and [[Richard Dashut]]) and "[[Isn't It Midnight]]" (Christine McVie) were also released as singles.

===1987–1995: Departures of Buckingham and Nicks===
With a ten-week tour scheduled, Buckingham held back at the last minute, saying he felt his creativity was being stifled. A group meeting at Christine McVie's house on 7 August 1987 resulted in turmoil. Tensions were coming to a head. Fleetwood said in his autobiography that there was a physical altercation between Buckingham and Nicks. Buckingham left the band the following day.<ref name="Play On"/> After Buckingham's departure, Fleetwood Mac added two new guitarists to the band, [[Billy Burnette]] and [[Rick Vito]], again without auditions.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Ressner|first1=Jeffrey|title=Lindsey Buckingham Leaves Fleetwood Mac|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lindsey-buckingham-leaves-fleetwood-mac-19870924|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=24 September 1987|access-date=24 February 2017|archive-date=7 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407215542/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lindsey-buckingham-leaves-fleetwood-mac-19870924|url-status=live}}</ref>

Burnette was the son of [[Dorsey Burnette]] and nephew of [[Johnny Burnette]], both of [[The Rock and Roll Trio]]. He had already worked with Fleetwood in Zoo, with Christine McVie as part of her solo band, had done some session work with Nicks, and backed Buckingham on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Fleetwood and Christine McVie had played on his ''Try Me'' album in 1985. Vito, a Peter Green admirer, had played with many artists from [[Bonnie Raitt]] to John Mayall, to [[Roger McGuinn]] in [[Thunderbyrd]] and worked with John McVie on two Mayall albums.

The 1987–88 "Shake the Cage" tour was the first outing for this line-up. It was successful enough to warrant the release of a concert video, also titled ''Tango in the Night'', which was filmed at San Francisco's [[Cow Palace]] arena in December 1987.

Capitalising on the success of the ''Tango in the Night'' album, the band released a ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in 1988. It featured singles from the 1975–1988 era and included two new compositions, "[[No Questions Asked (Fleetwood Mac song)|No Questions Asked]]" written by Nicks and Kelly Johnston, and "[[As Long as You Follow]]", written by Christine McVie and Quintela. 'As Long as You Follow' was released as a single in 1988 but only made No. 43 in the US and No. 66 in the UK, although it reached No.1 on the US Adult Contemporary charts. The ''Greatest Hits'' album, which peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 14 in the US (though it has since sold over 8 million copies there) was dedicated by the band to Buckingham, with whom they were now reconciled.

In 1990, Fleetwood Mac released their fifteenth studio album, ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]''. With this album, the band veered away from the stylised sound that Buckingham had evolved during his tenure (which was also evident in his solo work) and developed a more [[adult contemporary]] style with producer [[Greg Ladanyi]]. The album yielded only one Top 40 hit, Christine McVie's "[[Save Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Save Me]]". ''Behind the Mask'' only achieved [[RIAA certification|Gold]] album status in the US, peaking at No. 18 on the ''Billboard'' album chart, though it entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1. It received mixed reviews and was seen by some music critics as a low point for the band in the absence of Buckingham (who had actually made a guest appearance playing on the title track). But ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine said that Vito and Burnette were "the best thing to ever happen to Fleetwood Mac".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/behind-the-mask-19900531|title=''Behind the Mask'' review|last=Berger|first=Arion|date=31 May 1990|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=23 February 2012|archive-date=28 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228030534/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/behind-the-mask-19900531|url-status=live}}</ref> The subsequent "Behind the Mask" tour saw the band play sold-out shows at London's Wembley Stadium. In the final show in Los Angeles, Buckingham joined the band onstage. The two women of the band, McVie and Nicks, had decided that the tour would be their last (McVie's father had died during the tour), although both stated that they would still record with the band. In 1991, however, Nicks and Rick Vito left Fleetwood Mac altogether.

In 1992, Fleetwood arranged a 4-CD box set, spanning highlights from the band's 25-year history, entitled ''[[25 Years – The Chain]]'' (a cut-down 2-CD box set, ''Selections from 25 Years – The Chain'', was also released). A notable inclusion in the box set was "[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]", a Nicks composition that was recorded during the ''Rumours'' sessions but was omitted from the album and used as the B-side of "Go Your Own Way". Nicks had requested use of this track for her 1991 best-of compilation ''TimeSpace'', but Fleetwood had refused as he had planned to include it in this collection as a rarity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The disagreement between Nicks and Fleetwood garnered press coverage and was believed to have been the main reason for Nicks leaving the band in 1991.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Spanos |first1=Brittany |title='Silver Springs': Inside Fleetwood Mac's Great Lost Breakup Anthem |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/silver-springs-inside-fleetwood-macs-great-lost-breakup-anthem-201303/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=17 August 2017 |access-date=3 October 2018 |archive-date=6 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200106213741/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/silver-springs-inside-fleetwood-macs-great-lost-breakup-anthem-201303/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The box set also included a new Nicks/Vito composition, "[[Paper Doll (Fleetwood Mac song)|Paper Doll]]", which was released in the US as a single and produced by Buckingham and Richard Dashut.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boehm|first1=Mike|title=Life After Mac|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-12-10-ol-2617-story.html|website=Los Angelis Times|date=10 December 1992|access-date=14 November 2016|archive-date=23 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423143200/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-10/news/ol-2617_1_fleetwood-mac/3|url-status=live}}</ref> There were also two new Christine McVie compositions, "Heart of Stone" and [[Love Shines (song)|"Love Shines]]". "Love Shines" was released as a single in the UK and elsewhere. Buckingham also contributed a new song, "Make Me a Mask". Fleetwood also released a deluxe hardcover companion book to coincide with the release of the box set, titled ''My 25 Years in Fleetwood Mac''. The volume featured notes written by Fleetwood detailing the band's 25-year history and many rare photographs.

The classic 1974–1987 line-up reunited in 1993 at the request of US President [[Bill Clinton]] for his first [[United States presidential inaugural balls|Inaugural Ball]]. Clinton had made Fleetwood Mac's "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]" his campaign theme song. His request for it to be performed at the Inauguration Ball was met with enthusiasm by the band, although this line-up had no intention of reuniting permanently.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Greene|first1=Andy|title=Flashback: Fleetwood Mac Reunite for Bill Clinton's Inauguration|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-fleetwood-mac-reunite-for-bill-clintons-inauguration-20130122|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=22 January 2013|access-date=23 February 2017|archive-date=24 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224053117/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-fleetwood-mac-reunite-for-bill-clintons-inauguration-20130122|url-status=live}}</ref>

Inspired by the new interest in the band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Billy Burnette recorded another album as Fleetwood Mac, with [[Bekka Bramlett]], who had worked a year earlier with Fleetwood's Zoo, joining the band. Solo singer-songwriter/guitarist and original [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] member [[Dave Mason]], who had worked with Bekka's parents [[Delaney & Bonnie]] twenty-five years earlier, was also added.

Although she remained an official band member and would be part of the next studio album, Christine McVie chose to take a break from touring around this time. The other five members (Fleetwood, J. McVie, Burnette, Bramlett and Mason) toured in 1994, opening for [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]], and in 1995 as part of a package with [[REO Speedwagon]] and [[Pat Benatar]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=DeRiso |first1=Nick |title=Dave Mason on Traffic, Fleetwood Mac and going his own way |url=http://somethingelsereviews.com/2014/02/12/something-else-interview-dave-mason-on-traffic-fleetwood-mac-going-his-own-way/ |website=Something Else! |date=12 February 2014 |access-date=22 September 2018 |archive-date=10 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510163244/http://somethingelsereviews.com/2014/02/12/something-else-interview-dave-mason-on-traffic-fleetwood-mac-going-his-own-way/ |url-status=live }}</ref> This tour saw the band perform classic Fleetwood Mac songs spanning the band's whole history to that point. In 1995, at a concert in Tokyo, the band was greeted by former member Jeremy Spencer, who performed a few songs with them.<ref name="Definitive History"/>

On 10 October 1995, Fleetwood Mac released their sixteenth studio album, ''[[Time (Fleetwood Mac album)|Time]]'', which was not a success. Although it hit the UK Top 50 for one week, the album had zero impact in the US. It failed to graze the ''Billboard'' Top 200 albums chart, a reversal for a band that had been a mainstay on that chart for most of the previous two decades. Shortly after the album's release, Christine McVie informed the band that the album would be her last. Bramlett and Burnette subsequently formed a [[country music]] duo, [[Bekka & Billy]].<ref name="Definitive History"/><ref>{{Cite web |date=10 August 1997 |title=Melbourne Herald Sun (08/10/1997), Bekka & Billy |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=88&c=14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230223254/http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=88&c=14|archive-date=30 December 2015|access-date=22 October 2023|website=The Blue Letter Archives}}</ref>

=== 1995–2007: Reformation, reunion, and Christine McVie's departure ===
Just weeks after disbanding Fleetwood Mac, Mick Fleetwood started working with Lindsey Buckingham again. John McVie was added to the sessions, and later Christine McVie. Stevie Nicks also enlisted Buckingham to produce a song for a soundtrack. In May 1996, Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Nicks performed together at a private party in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], Kentucky, prior to the [[Kentucky Derby]], with [[Steve Winwood]] filling in for Buckingham. A week later, the ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' film soundtrack was released, which featured the Nicks-Buckingham duet "[[Twisted (Stevie Nicks song)|Twisted]]", with Fleetwood on drums. This eventually led to a full reunion of the ''Rumours'' line-up, which officially reformed in March 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/mick-fleetwood-fleetwood-mac-is-the-most-abused-franchise-in-the-business|title=Mick Fleetwood: 'Fleetwood Mac is the most abused franchise in the business'|last=October 2017|first=Dave Everley02|website=Classic Rock Magazine| date=2 October 2017 |language=en|access-date=21 February 2020|archive-date=21 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191546/https://www.loudersound.com/features/mick-fleetwood-fleetwood-mac-is-the-most-abused-franchise-in-the-business|url-status=live}}</ref>

The regrouped Fleetwood Mac performed a live concert on a soundstage at [[Warner Bros.]] [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California, on 22 May 1997. Buckingham said in an interview with ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo magazine]]'' regarding the five of them coming together again that their "chemistry was very present".<ref name="DigWebsite">{{cite web |last1=Tiller |first1=Joe |title='The Dance': Behind Fleetwood Mac's Emotional 90s Reunion |url=https://www.thisisdig.com/feature/the-dance-fleetwood-mac-live-album/ |website=Dig! |date=19 August 2022}}</ref> The concert was recorded and filmed, and from this performance came the 1997 live album and video ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'', which brought the band back to the top of the US album charts for the first time in ten years. In addition to live performances of their most notable songs, the album also featured new songs including "[[Bleed to Love Her]]" and "[[Temporary One]]".<ref name="DigWebsite"/> The album was certified five million units by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Fleetwood+Mac%22|title=RIAA – Gold and Platinum Searchable Database|publisher=riaa.com|access-date=7 May 2014|archive-date=24 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924133402/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Fleetwood+Mac%22|url-status=live}}</ref> An arena tour followed the [[MTV]] premiere of ''The Dance'' video and kept the reunited Fleetwood Mac on the road throughout much of 1997, the 20th anniversary of ''Rumours''. With additional musicians Neale Heywood on guitar, Brett Tuggle on keyboards, Lenny Castro on percussion and Sharon Celani (who had toured with the band in the late 1980s) and Mindy Stein on backing vocals, this would be the final appearance of the classic line-up including Christine McVie for 16 years.

In 1998 Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fleetwood Mac Hall of Fame|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/fleetwood-mac|work=rockhall.com|access-date=6 March 2020|archive-date=14 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614002723/https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/fleetwood-mac|url-status=live}}</ref> Members inducted were the 1968–1970 band – Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, and Danny Kirwan – and ''Rumours''-era members Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks, and Lindsey Buckingham. Bob Welch was not included, despite his key role in keeping the band alive during the early 1970s. The ''Rumours''-era version of the band performed both at the induction ceremony and at the Grammy Awards programme that year. Peter Green attended the induction ceremony but did not perform with his former bandmates, opting instead to perform his composition "[[Black Magic Woman]]" with [[Santana (band)|Santana]], who were inducted the same night. Neither Jeremy Spencer nor Danny Kirwan attended. Fleetwood Mac also received the "Outstanding Contribution to Music" award at the [[Brit Awards]] (British Phonographic Industry Awards) the same year.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1998|access-date=13 February 2019|website=BRIT Awards|archive-date=13 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213123855/https://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1998|url-status=live}}</ref> Shortly after this, Christine McVie officially left the band.

2002 saw the release of ''[[The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac]]'', issued as a 21-track single CD in the UK and a 40-track double CD in the US. Christine McVie's departure left Buckingham and Nicks as the two singer-songwriters on the band's seventeenth studio album, ''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'', released in 2003 (although Christine contributed some backing vocals and keyboards as a guest). The album debuted at No.3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart (No. 6 in the UK) and yielded chart hits with "[[Peacekeeper (Fleetwood Mac song)|Peacekeeper]]" and the title track, and a successful world arena tour which lasted through 2004. The tour grossed $27,711,129 and was ranked No. 21 in the top 25 grossing tours of 2004.

Around 2004–05 there were rumours of a reunion of the early line-up of Fleetwood Mac involving Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer. While these two apparently remained unconvinced,<ref name="wasserzeiher">{{cite journal | title=The Return of Jeremy Spencer | last=Wasserzieher | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Wasserzieher |journal=Blues Revue | url=http://www.bluesrevue.com/jeremyspencer.html | access-date=20 May 2008 |date=October 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080220105101/http://www.bluesrevue.com/jeremyspencer.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 20 February 2008}}</ref> in April 2006 bassist John McVie, during a question-and-answer session on the ''Penguin'' Fleetwood Mac fan website, said of the reunion idea:

In interviews given in November 2006 to support his solo album ''[[Under the Skin (Lindsey Buckingham album)|Under the Skin]]'', Buckingham stated that plans for the band to reunite once more for a 2008 tour were still in the cards. Recording plans had been put on hold for the foreseeable future. In an interview Nicks gave to the UK newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in September 2007, she stated that she was unwilling to carry on with the band unless Christine McVie returned.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Stevie Nicks: a survivor's story |first=Mick |last=Brown |date=8 September 2007 |access-date=2 May 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814182335/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3667803/Stevie-Nicks-a-survivors-story.html |archive-date=14 August 2015}}</ref>

===2008–2013: Touring activity===
In March 2008, it was mooted that [[Sheryl Crow]] might work with Fleetwood Mac in 2009. Crow and Stevie Nicks had collaborated in the past and Crow had stated that Nicks had been a great teacher and inspiration to her.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/17/people.crow.ap/ |title=Sheryl Crow to sing with Fleetwood Mac |agency=Associated Press |date=17 March 2008 |publisher=CNN |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323033610/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/17/people.crow.ap/ |archive-date=23 March 2008}}</ref> Later, Buckingham said that the potential collaboration with Crow had "lost its momentum"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044691/sans-crow-fleetwood-mac-to-tour-in-2009 |title=Sans Crow, Fleetwood Mac To Tour In 2009 |first=Gary |last=Graff |magazine=Billboard |date=23 July 2008 |access-date=25 March 2013 |archive-date=13 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913062105/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044691/sans-crow-fleetwood-mac-to-tour-in-2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the idea was abandoned.

In March 2009, Fleetwood Mac started their "[[Unleashed (concert tour)|Unleashed]]" tour, again without Christine McVie. It was a greatest hits show, although album tracks such as "[[Storms (Fleetwood Mac song)|Storms]]" and "[[I Know I'm Not Wrong]]" were also played. During their show on 20 June 2009 in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, Stevie Nicks premiered part of a new song that she had written about [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/showpost.php?p=827021&postcount=14 |title=The Ledge – View Single Post – New Orleans Arena, NOLA – June&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2009 |publisher=Ledge.fleetwoodmac.net |access-date=29 August 2010 |archive-date=25 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125095317/http://www.ledge.fleetwoodmac.net/showpost.php?p=827021&postcount=14 |url-status=live }}</ref> The song was later released as "New Orleans" on Nicks's 2011 album ''[[In Your Dreams (Stevie Nicks album)|In Your Dreams]]'' with Mick Fleetwood on drums. In October 2009 and November, the band toured Europe, followed by Australia and New Zealand in December. In October, 2002's ''[[The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac]]'' was re-released in the UK, this time using the US 2-CD track listing, entering at number six on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 November 2009 a one-hour documentary, ''Fleetwood Mac: Don't Stop'', was broadcast in the UK on [[BBC One]], featuring recent interviews with all four current band members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nq7q9|title=Fleetwood Mac: Don't Stop – BBC One|publisher=BBC|access-date=26 May 2016|archive-date=25 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625014316/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nq7q9|url-status=live}}</ref> During the documentary, Nicks gave a candid summary of the current state of her relationship with Buckingham, saying, "Maybe when we're 75 and Fleetwood Mac is a distant memory, we might be friends."

On 6 November 2009, Fleetwood Mac played the last show of the European leg of their ''Unleashed'' tour at London's [[Wembley Arena]]. Christine McVie was in the audience. Nicks paid tribute to her from the stage to a standing ovation from the audience, saying that she thought about her former bandmate "every day", and dedicated that night's performance of "[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]" to her. On 19 December 2009, Fleetwood Mac played the second-to-last show of their ''Unleashed'' tour to a sell-out crowd in New Zealand, at what was intended to be a one-off event at the [[Brooklands, Taranaki|TSB Bowl of Brooklands]] in New Plymouth. Tickets, after pre-sales, sold out within twelve minutes of public release. Another date, Sunday 20 December, was added<ref>{{cite web|title=Front Row King|url=http://frontrowking.com/buy-fleetwood-mac-concert-tickets/index.html|access-date=26 February 2014|archive-date=26 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226204823/http://frontrowking.com/buy-fleetwood-mac-concert-tickets/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and also sold out. The tour grossed $84,900,000 and was ranked No. 13 in the highest grossing worldwide tours of 2009. On 19 October 2010, Fleetwood Mac played a private show at the Phoenician Hotel in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] for TPG ([[Texas Pacific Group]]).

On 3 May 2011, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] broadcast an episode of ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' entitled "Rumours" that featured six songs from the band's 1977 album.<ref>{{cite web|last=Semigran|first=Aly|title=Fleetwood Mac Teach 'Glee' Kids A Lesson On Rumours:New Directions took on six songs from the classic album as their own internal strife mirrored the band's|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663211/glee-fleetwood-mac-rumours.jhtml|publisher=MTV|access-date=29 August 2011|archive-date=12 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812043339/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1663211/glee-fleetwood-mac-rumours.jhtml|url-status=dead}}</ref> The show sparked renewed interest in the band and its most commercially successful album, and ''Rumours'' re-entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart at No.11 in the same week that Nicks's solo album ''[[In Your Dreams (Stevie Nicks album)|In Your Dreams]]'' debuted at No.6.

Music downloads accounted for 91 per cent of the ''Rumours'' sales. The spike in sales for ''Rumours'' represented an increase of 1,951%.

The band's 2013 tour, which took place in 34 cities, started on 4 April in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. The band performed two new songs ("[[Sad Angel]]" and "Without You"), which Buckingham described as some of the most "Fleetwood Mac-ey"-sounding songs since ''Mirage''. "Without You" was rerecorded from the Buckingham-Nicks era.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/04/fleetwood-mac-tour-band-34-city-april_n_2238053.html |title=Fleetwood Mac Tour: Band To Start 34-City Tour In April |work=HuffPost |date=4 December 2012 |access-date=4 December 2012 |archive-date=5 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205010346/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/04/fleetwood-mac-tour-band-34-city-april_n_2238053.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The band released their first new studio material in ten years, ''[[Extended Play (Fleetwood Mac EP)|Extended Play]]'', on 30 April 2013.<ref name="Fleetwood Mac EP">{{cite web|last=Gallucci|first=Michael|title=Fleetwood Mac, 'Extended Play' Album Review|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/fleetwood-mac-extended-play-album-review/|access-date=24 May 2013|date=30 April 2013|archive-date=11 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511135138/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/fleetwood-mac-extended-play-album-review/|url-status=live}}</ref> The EP debuted and peaked at No. 48 in the US and produced one single, "[[Sad Angel]]".

In January 2015, Buckingham suggested that the new album and tour might be Fleetwood Mac's last, and that the band would cease operations in 2015 or soon afterwards.

He said that after their performance at the MusiCares event, the band's manager, Irving Azoff, had told him that, among other things, Nicks was not happy about his reaction to the intro music for their acceptance speech being "Rhiannon", and about the way he had allegedly smirked during her thank-you speech. Buckingham conceded the first point, stating that it wasn't the specific song choice that was the issue, but how it reduced the impact of the band's entrance. Azoff subsequently told him that Nicks had given the rest of the band an ultimatum: either Buckingham went or she would.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lindsey-buckingham-fleetwood-mac-firing-733460/|title=Lindsey Buckingham: Life After Fleetwood Mac|first=David|last=Fricke|date=10 October 2018|website=rollingstone.com|access-date=10 October 2018|archive-date=11 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011013912/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lindsey-buckingham-fleetwood-mac-firing-733460/|url-status=live}}</ref>
