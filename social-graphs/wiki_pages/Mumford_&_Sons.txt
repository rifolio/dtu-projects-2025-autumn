'''Mumford & Sons''' are an English [[folk rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2008/10/29/londoncalling_mumford_and_sons_feature.shtml|title=Mumford and Sons|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The band consists of [[Marcus Mumford]] (lead vocals, guitar, drums), [[Ted Dwane]] (vocals, bass), and [[Ben Lovett (British musician)|Ben Lovett]] (vocals, keyboards).

Mumford & Sons have released five studio albums: ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'' (2009), ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'' (2012), ''[[Wilder Mind]]'' (2015), ''[[Delta (Mumford & Sons album)|Delta]]'' (2018), and ''[[Rushmere (album)|Rushmere]]'' (2025). Their debut ''Sigh No More'' peaked at number two on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US, with ''Babel'', ''Wilder Mind'' and ''Delta'' all debuting at number one in the US, the former becoming the fastest-selling rock album of the decade and leading to a headline performance at [[Glastonbury Festival in 2013]].<ref name=BabelUK/><ref name=BabelUS/>

The band has won music awards throughout their career, with ''Sigh No More'' earning the band the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for [[2011 BRIT Awards|Best British Album]] in 2011, a [[Mercury Prize]] nomination and six overall [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations. The live performance at the 2011 Grammy ceremony with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Avett Brothers]] led to a surge in popularity for the band in the US. The band received eight total Grammy nominations for ''Babel'' and won the Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. The band also won the Brit Award for [[2013 BRIT Awards|Best British Group]] in 2013 and an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for International Achievement in 2014.

==History==
===Early years (2007–2009)===
Mumford & Sons was formed in late 2007<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mumford-and-Sons|title=Mumford & Sons &#124; British music group|website=Britannica.com|date=10 May 2023 }}</ref> by multi-instrumentalists [[Marcus Mumford]], [[Ted Dwane]], [[Ben Lovett (British musician)|Ben Lovett]], and [[Winston Marshall]]. Band members play acoustic guitar, drums, keyboard instruments, bass guitar, and traditional folk instruments such as [[banjo]], [[mandolin]] and [[resonator guitar]].<ref>{{Cite magazine <!-- Deny Citation Bot--> |magazine=Billboard|last=Kamps|first= Garrett|volume=127|issue=13|date=May 9, 2015|page=47 |id = {{ProQuest|1686669917}}|title=Bye, Banjos: Mumford & Sons Plug In and Rock Out}}</ref><ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2008/10/29/londoncalling_mumford_and_sons_feature.shtml|title=London – Radio – Mumford and Sons|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> The band name originates from Marcus Mumford being the most visible member, organising the band and their performances. Lovett indicated that the name was meant to evoke the sense of an "antiquated family business name".<ref name=Collis>Collis, Clark (4 March 2011). [http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/03/04/mumford-and-sons-sigh-no-more/ "Mumford and Sons: Ben Lovett talks about playing with Dylan, recording with Ray Davies, and high-fiving R. Kelly"]. ''Entertainment Weekly Music Mix''. Retrieved 6 January 2011.</ref>

A handful of similar bands were increasing their visibility in [[West London (sub region)|West London]] around the same time, giving rise to the label "West London folk scene". Mumford downplays that characterisation as an exaggeration—Mumford & Sons and a few other folk acts just happened to be operating in the same general area at the time. In an interview with the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', Marcus Mumford said, "It's not folk really. Well, some of it is, and it's certainly not a scene. Someone got over-excited about a few bands who live in a hundred-mile radius and put it in a box to sell it as a package. It's a community, not a scene. It's not exclusive." Having developed in the same musical and cultural environment, Mumford & Sons' sound has been compared to that of artists such as [[Noah and the Whale]], [[Johnny Flynn (musician)|Johnny Flynn]] or [[Laura Marling]], whose backing band had included Marshall, Mumford, and Dwane.<ref>Walker, Tim (28 July 2008).

In early 2008, the band began working with manager Adam Tudhope, who, as part of management company Everybody's, also represents [[Keane (band)|Keane]] and Laura Marling.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Bloom.html |title=Interview With Louis Bloom |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=4 April 2011 |access-date=18 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704123311/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Bloom.html |archive-date=4 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was through Tudhope's connection that Mumford & Sons was exposed to their future [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] at Island, Louis Bloom, who began monitoring the band. Bloom told [[HitQuarters]] that they were still at a fledgling state and not yet ready for a label deal: "There was no one there for it, just a few friends, and they needed time to develop. Over the next six months I kept going to see them and they were literally picking up fans every time."<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>

In February 2008, the band completed an extensive UK tour with support from [[Alessi's Ark]], [[Sons of Noel and Adrian]], [[Peggy Sue (band)|Peggy Sue]] and others. June 2008 marked the band's first appearance at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2008|Glastonbury Festival]].<ref name="bbc"/> They also toured Australia with Laura Marling, whose disinclination to interact with audiences encouraged Mumford into the spotlight. The experience helped inform his attitude towards Mumford & Sons audiences, which is to interact frequently and to try to create a comfortable, casual atmosphere.<ref name=Betts>Betts, Marianne (25 March 2010).

===''Sigh No More'' (2009–2012)===
Throughout 2008 and into 2009, Mumford & Sons performed in small to moderate venues in the UK and US, exposing audiences to ''Love Your Ground'' tracks and other material that would eventually become ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]''. The band finally recorded ''Sigh No More'' with [[Markus Dravs]], who had produced albums with artists such as [[Arcade Fire]].<ref name=Betts /> At the time, band members did not even own their own instruments—Dravs initially turned them away when they showed up at the recording sessions empty-handed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/mumfordandsons/46631|title=Mumford And Sons: 'We were banished from studio by producer'|date=12 August 2009|work=NME|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> The only track from ''Love Your Ground'' to be included on ''Sigh No More'' was "[[Little Lion Man]]". The band told the ''Herald Sun'' that they self-financed the album to avoid the artistic and technical compromises that sometimes befall studio-financed projects.<ref name=Betts /> They toured again in support of Laura Marling in 2009, and Mumford & Sons was contributing musicians to her 2010 album ''[[I Speak Because I Can]]''.<ref name=Betts /><ref name="bbcsound">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7766446.stm|title=BBC Sound of 2009: Mumford & Sons|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref>

In August 2009, Mumford & Sons signed a licensing deal to [[Island Records]] in the UK, to [[Dew Process]] in Australia and New Zealand, to [[Glassnote Records]] in North America and [[V2 Records|Cooperative Music]] in the rest of the world, and through its own label Gentlemen of the Road. Dew Process boss [[Paul Piticco]] signed the band after witnessing a US performance in 2009 and appreciating their "honest" approach and unique sound.<ref name=Betts /> Their debut album was released on 5 October 2009 with "Little Lion Man" as the lead single.

[[Dave Berry (presenter)|Dave Berry]] of [[XFM]] named "Little Lion Man" his record of the week, and in another interview with the band, Berry said "Screw 'of the week', it's my favourite track of the year."

===''Rushmere'' (2025–present)===
On 15 January 2025, Mumford & Sons announced their first album in seven years, ''[[Rushmere (album)|Rushmere]]'', to be released 28 March. The announcement was made alongside an official trailer including snippets of new music and behind-the-scenes studio footage. Its lead single, also titled "Rushmere" was released 2 days later on 17 January. The band went on to confirm that the track and album were co-produced by [[Dave Cobb]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.nme.com/news/music/mumford-sons-announce-first-album-in-seven-years-RUSHMERE-3829463|title= Mumford & Sons announce first new album in seven years, ''RUSHMERE''|website= [[NME]]|date= 16 January 2025}}</ref>

The band relaunched the [[Railroad Revival Tour]] in the summer of 2025, playing venues along the [[East Coast of the United States]] alongside other folk musicians.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Blistein |first=Jon |date=2025-05-13 |title=Mumford & Sons Are Reviving Their Railroad Revival Tour |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mumford-and-sons-2025-railroad-revival-tour-1235337852/ |access-date=2025-08-07 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Musical style and development==
[[File:Mumford drums.jpg|thumb|right|The band members play multiple instruments in live performances. Here Marcus Mumford sits at a drum kit.]]
Mumford & Sons have been described by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and ''[[Forbes]]'' as a [[folk rock]] band.<ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www3.forbes.com/business/the-worlds-highest-paid-musicians-of-2016/4/ |title=The World's Highest-Paid Musicians Of 2016 |author=Greenburg, Zack O'Malley |magazine=[[Forbes]] |date=December 2016 |access-date=14 December 2016 |author-link=Zack O'Malley Greenburg |archive-date=16 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716082441/https://www3.forbes.com/business/the-worlds-highest-paid-musicians-of-2016/4/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> They began by using [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[Folk music|folk]] instrumentation, with the core instruments of acoustic guitar, banjo, piano and a double bass, played with a rhythmic style based in [[alternative rock]] and folk. In the documentary ''Big Easy Express'', Marcus Mumford recognises the [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] influence: "I first heard Old Crow's music when I was, like, 16, 17, and that really got me into, like, folk music, bluegrass. I mean, I'd listened to a lot of Dylan, but I hadn't really ventured into the country world so much. So Old Crow was the band that made me fall in love with country music."<ref name=Hight>{{cite news|last=Hight|first=Jewly|title=Old Crow Medicine Show: The Wheel Of Life|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/08/old-crow-medicine-show-the-wheel-of-life/|access-date=5 September 2012|newspaper=American Songwriter|date=30 August 2012}}</ref> Mumford acknowledges that "the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in London." Ketch Secor, Old Crow front-man, concurs: "Those boys took the message and ran with it."<ref name=Talbott>{{cite news|last=Talbott|first=Chris|title=Old Crow Medicine Show starts new chapter with 'Carry Me Back'|url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2012/08/08/old-crow-medicine-show-starts-new-chapter-with-carry-me-back/|access-date=26 September 2012|newspaper=The Tennessean|date=8 August 2012}}</ref> {{blockquote|[[Emmylou Harris]] was "among the gateway artists who helped Mumford and bandmates Ben Lovett, Ted Dwane and Winston Marshall discover their love for American roots music. It started with the [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' soundtrack]] ... That eventually led them to the Old Crow Medicine Show and then deep immersion in old-timey sounds from America's long-neglected past."<ref name=Talbott2>{{cite news|last=Talbott|first=Chris|title=Emmylou, Mumford & Sons team for 'CMT Crossroads'|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120926/us-music-mumford-and-emmylou/|access-date=26 September 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=26 September 2012}}</ref>}}

Much of Mumford & Sons' lyrical content has a strong literary influence, their debut album name deriving from a line in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''. The track "Sigh No More" includes lines from the play such as ''Serve God love me and mend'', ''For man is a giddy thing'', and ''One foot in sea and one on shore.'' The title of the song "Roll Away Your Stone" is an allusion to ''[[Macbeth]]''; the song includes the line ''Stars hide your fires/ And these here are my desires'' which borrows and pares down Macbeth's line in act 1, scene 4: ''Stars, hide your fires,/ Let not light see my black and deep desires.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare-navigators.com/macbeth/T14.html|title=MACBETH, Act 1 Scene 4|publisher=Shakespeare-navigators.com|access-date=24 September 2012}}</ref> Additionally, "The Cave" includes several references to ''[[The Odyssey]]'', in particular the sirens that Odysseus encounters on his journey home. The song also contains many references to [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s book, ''St. Francis of Assisi'', in which Chesterton uses [[Allegory of the Cave|Plato's Cave]] as a way of explaining how [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] views the world from God's perspective. Both "Timshel" and "Dust Bowl Dance" draw heavily from the [[John Steinbeck]] novels ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'' and ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''.

The band's change in sound on their third album was described by Lovett as a "natural departure". At the end of the ''Babel'' tour Winston Marshall traded his banjo for electric guitar in sound checks and Mumford started playing more drums as the band jammed on heavy instrumentals and even some Radiohead tunes. Banjo, an instrument that had become synonymous with the band, does not feature on the record. ''[[NME]]''<ref name="nme.com"/> reported that the band's sound is "More expansive than ever and decidedly heavier, thanks to the shift in instrumentation." The group also employed a full drumkit instead of kick drum. "We've had our standard line-up of instruments for the last six years and we felt like that was our palette, [but] we started picking up other stuff," said Lovett. "It's a very natural departure from some of that rootsier stuff."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Doyle |first=Patrick |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/mumford-sons-talk-going-electric-on-new-album-wilder-mind-20150302?page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305064359/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/mumford-sons-talk-going-electric-on-new-album-wilder-mind-20150302?page=2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 March 2015 |title=Page 2 of Mumford & Sons Talk Going Electric on New Album 'Wilder Mind' |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=2 March 2015 |access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref>

Lovett told ''NME'' that working with [[James Ford (musician)|James Ford]] for ''Wilder Mind'' was part of trying something new. "We felt a need for change. Not from Markus [Dravs], but he was so closely attached to those first two records that as we had taken that time off, we wanted to try doing something new. It felt like, if we do our third record with Markus, does that mean we do our ninth and 10th records with Markus? At some point you have to try different things, as we collectively felt like it was time to try other stuff. Markus knows that we might well make the next record with him. We definitely haven't broken up [with Dravs], we're just playing the field!"<ref name="nme.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/mumford-and-sons/83246 |title=NME News Mumford & Sons say going electric on new album is 'a natural departure' |website=NME |date=3 March 2015 |access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref>

===Lyrical themes===
Many of Mumford & Sons' songs seem to be "laden with the themes and imagery of faith - often drawing specifically upon the [[Christian]] tradition."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sj-r.com/story/lifestyle/faith/2013/04/13/commentary-marcus-mumford-is-on/41725373007/ |title=Marcus Mumford is on a journey, just like you |newspaper=The State Journal-Register |publisher=The State Journal Register |date=13 April 2013 |access-date=6 March 2024}}</ref> Songs that have been emphasised as correlating with Christian elements include "[[Believe (Mumford & Sons song)|Believe]]", "[[Guiding Light (Mumford & Sons song)|Guiding Light]]" and "[[Roll Away Your Stone]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/mumford-sons-10-best-songs-about-wrestling-faith/ |title=Mumford & Sons' 10 Best Songs About Wrestling with Faith |publisher=Relevant Magazine |date=28 September 2018 |access-date=6 March 2024}}</ref> The band's lead singer, Marcus Mumford, was also raised in a devout Christian home, with his parents, Eleanor and John Mumford leading the Vineyard Church in the United Kingdom and Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deseret.com/2015/3/11/20560482/mumford-and-sons-latest-song-believe-stays-faithful-to-the-band-s-christian-roots/ |title=Mumford and Sons' latest song 'Believe' stays faithful to the band's Christian roots |publisher=Deseret News |date=11 March 2015 |access-date=6 March 2024}}</ref> However, when questioned about their Christian affiliation, Mumford was quick to push away from any form of religious adherence, stating, "I wouldn't call myself a Christian... I've kind of separated myself from the culture of Christianity... [but my] spiritual journey is a work in progress."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mumford-sons-rattle-and-strum-78883/#ixzz3XWyfvpax |title=Mumford & Sons: Rattle and Strum |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=28 March 2013 |access-date=6 March 2024}}</ref> Later, Mumford reaffirmed this position on behalf of the band, responding to a question about whether the band's songs relate to Mumford's journey back to the Christian faith of his childhood by stating, "It's not about that all, sorry! I don't even call myself a Christian. Spirituality is the word we engage with more. We're fans of faith, not religion."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bigissue.com/culture/music/mumford-sons-fans-faith-not-religion/ |title=Mumford & Sons: "We're fans of faith, not religion" |publisher=the Big Issue |date=3 October 2012 |access-date=6 March 2024}}</ref>

==Other ventures==
In 2009, the band founded Gentlemen of the Road, a live promotions company, record label and organiser of the global series of Stopover Festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentlemenoftheroad.com |title=Tickets, Line-up, News & Info |publisher=Gentlemenoftheroad.com |access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref> These festivals tend to take place in towns and villages not normally toured in by bands or singers in an effort to bring money to the place and help businesses there.{{failed verification|date=March 2017}} The band handpicks the supporting acts which play for the Stopover Festivals.
