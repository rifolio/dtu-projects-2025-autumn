    "droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.",
    "Because he's holding a thermal detonator.",
    "The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the",
    "room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the",
    "bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba",
    "stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across",

    "Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.",

    "appreciative creatures.",
    "Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the",
    "scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across",
    "the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling",
    "his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.",

    "At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.",
    "Master Luke, you're standing on...",
    "JABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)",
    "There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.",
    "Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies",
    "into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his",
    "hand.",
    "Oh, no! The Rancor!",
    "At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged",
    "RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries",
    "futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.",
    "The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the",
    "Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few",
    "screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers",
    "and laughs at the guard's fate.",
    "The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just",
    "ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of",
    "an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his",
    "salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the",
    "monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in",
    "rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an",
    "avalanche.",
    "The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes",
    "into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the",
    "holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility",
    "door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into",
    "the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it",
    "down on the Rancor's finger.",
    "Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed",
    "that you are to be terminated immediately.",
    "You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of",
    "Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.",
    "HAN\t (to Luke)",
    "Doesn't sound so bad.",
    "In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as",
    "you are slowly digested over a thousand years.",
    "Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?",
    "Artoo beeps a quick reply.",
    "Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous.",
    "They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!",
    "Artoo whistles a singsong response.",
    "Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.",
    "Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die",
    "honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba",
    "the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.",
    "Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!",
    "Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream,",
    "crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye",
    "dangling from a wire) hurry off.",
    "Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.",
    "Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself,",
    "tumbling toward the sand.",
    "Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she",
    "has brought around to point down at the deck.",
    "Sounds dangerous.",
    "LEIA\t (to Han)",
    "I wonder who they found to pull that off.",
    "\"Exciting\" is hardly the word I would use.",
    "Here we go again.",
    "Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.",
    "THEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering",
    "through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked",
    "nearby.",
    "Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!",
    "Han, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.",
    "Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's",
    "too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.",
    "Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.",
    "They move off into the woods.",
    "THREEPIO\t (to Artoo)",
    "And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!",
    "Oh, Master Luke.",
    "I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.",
    "HAN\t (gravely)",
    "I hope she's alright.",
    "Chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off",
    "through the foliage.",
    "Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-",
    "op!!",
    "Artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net,",
    "crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they",
    "realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long",
    "spear.",
    "Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!",
    "When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among",
    "themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok",
    "nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In",
    "a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled",
    "bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks",
    "begin to chant at Threepio.",
    "Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million",
    "forms of",
    "communication.",
    "Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive",
    "dialect.  But",
    "I do believe they think I am some sort of god.",
    "Chewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange",
    "\"what next?\" looks.",
    "I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.",
    "It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.",
    "Han moves toward Threepio threateningly.",
    "I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the",
    "main course at a",
    "banquet in my honor.",
    "The drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut.",
    "Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening",
    "at the same moment the prisoners see her.",
    "HAN and LUKE",
    "Leia!",
    "As she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.",
    "Your Royal Highness.",
    "Artoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the",
    "assembled Ewoks and sighs.",
    "But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --",
    "You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...",
    "Now the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the",
    "ground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.",
    "... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear!",
    "Oh!",
    "The Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio",
    "begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio",
    "calling out in total panic at his situation.",
    "Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help!",
    "Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!",
    "Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and",
    "release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group",
    "embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at",
    "him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground.",
    "Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground.",
    "When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo",
    "beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him,",
    "finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The",
    "Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group",
    "of Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and",
    "marveling at his height.",
    "Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.",
    "Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.",
    "Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han",
    "Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.",
    "At the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in",
    "agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.",
    "The drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer",
    "and screeches.",
    "Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.",
    "Several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.",
    "He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield",
    "generator.",
    "Chewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders",
    "outside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.",
    "He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.",
    "Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!",
    "I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.",
    "I have decided that we shall stay here.",
    "Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.",
    "Inside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial",
    "commander enters.",
    "Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?",
    "Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?",
    "We surrender.",
    "The stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting",
    "quietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a",
    "band of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.",
    "Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.",
    "In a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK",
    "ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their",
    "fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and",
    "their awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting",
    "Ewoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the",
    "trees above.",
    "In the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for",
    "the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes",
    "to the bunker door control panel.",
    "Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo?",
    "No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!",
    "Biker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the",

    "The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting",

    "Chewie barks a reply.",
    "A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets",

    "Luke!",
    "Fine. Together again, huh?",
    "How are we doing?",
    "That bad, huh? Where's Leia?",
    "Luke looks to Leia.",
    "Good, I hate long waits.",
    "On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?",
    "Chewie barks his agreement.",
    "I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a",
    "big light blur.",
    "You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.",
    "Oh... great!",
    "Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get",
    "no such pleasure from us. Right?",
    "Chewie growls his agreement.",
    "Chewie, you okay? Where is he?",
    "The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.",
    "I'm okay, pal.",
    "For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a",
    "cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong",
    "cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from",
    "the wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight",
    "up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable",
    "and stands free.",
    "Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is",

    "Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?",
    "The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand",
    "whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.",
    "The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts",
    "off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the",
    "side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams",
    "as his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into",
    "the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a",
    "weak congratulations to Han.",
    "Lando, grab it!",
    "I'm trying!",
    "A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han",
    "and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks,",
    "and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot",
    "catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit.",
    "The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit",
    "from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.",

    "pit.",
    "Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!",
    "Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck",
    "gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the",
    "skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail",
    "Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up",
    "the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his",
    "head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks",
    "the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.",
    "The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who",
    "is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron",
    "has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by",
    "lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand",
    "moves him closer to his final reward.",
    "Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!",
    "Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let",
    "go of the spear.",
    "Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.",
    "Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly",

    "Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.",
    "It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.",
    "Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!",
    "I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!",
    "No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest",
