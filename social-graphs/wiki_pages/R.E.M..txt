'''R.E.M.''' was an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in [[Athens, Georgia]], in 1980 by drummer [[Bill Berry]], guitarist [[Peter Buck]], bassist [[Mike Mills]], and lead vocalist [[Michael Stipe]], who were students at the [[University of Georgia]]. R.E.M. was noted for Buck's [[arpeggiated]] "[[jangle]]" guitar playing; Stipe's distinctive vocal style, unique stage presence, and cryptic lyrics; Mills's [[Counter-melody|countermelodic]] bass lines and backing vocals; and Berry's tight, economical drumming. In the early 1990s, other alternative rock acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] named R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left in 1997 due to health issues, the remaining members continued with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011, having sold more than 90 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music acts]].

The band released their first single, "[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, their first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. Over the course of the decade, R.E.M. released acclaimed albums, commencing with their debut ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983), and continuing yearly with ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]'' (1984), ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'' (1985), ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'' (1986), and ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' (1987). During their most successful period, they worked with the producer [[Scott Litt]]. With constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]] following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single "[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]". They signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, releasing ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'' later that year, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing arenas worldwide.

R.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), put them in the vanguard of alternative rock at the time. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single "[[Losing My Religion]]" was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' (1994) continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time [[List of largest music deals|the most expensive recording contract ever]]. The tour was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly during soundchecks. The resulting record, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996), is hailed as the band's last great album and the members' favorite, growing in cult status over the years. Berry left the band the following year for health reasons, and Stipe, Buck and Mills continued as a musical trio, supplemented by studio and live musicians, such as the multi-instrumentalists [[Scott McCaughey]] and [[Ken Stringfellow]] and the drummers [[Joey Waronker]] and [[Bill Rieflin]]. They also parted ways with their longtime manager [[Jefferson Holt]], at which point the band's attorney [[Bertis Downs IV|Bertis Downs]] assumed managerial duties. Seeking to also renovate their sound, the band stopped working with Litt, and hired as co-producer [[Pat McCarthy (record producer)|Pat McCarthy]], who had worked as mixer and engineer on the band's previous two albums.

After the [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Experimental music|experimental]] direction of ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]'' (1998), which was commercially unsuccessful, ''[[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|Reveal]]'' (2001), referred to as "a conscious return to their classic sound",<ref name="amgreveal">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/reveal-mw0000586964 |title=''Reveal'' – R.E.M. |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=August 31, 2020 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |archive-date=October 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020082734/https://www.allmusic.com/album/reveal-mw0000586964 |url-status=live }}</ref> received general acclaim.

In 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in their first year of eligibility. Berry reunited with the band for the ceremony, and to record a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Number 9 Dream|#9 Dream]]" for the 2007 compilation album ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]'' to benefit [[Amnesty International]]'s campaign to alleviate the [[Darfur conflict]]. Looking for a change of sound after lukewarm reception for ''[[Around the Sun]]'' (2004), the band collaborated with the producer [[Jacknife Lee]] on their final two studio albums—the well-received ''[[Accelerate (R.E.M. album)|Accelerate]]'' (2008) and ''[[Collapse into Now]]'' (2011). In 2024, the band reunited to perform "Losing My Religion" at their induction into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and once again in 2025 to perform "[[Pretty Persuasion (song)|Pretty Persuasion]]" at the [[40 Watt Club]] in Athens.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harrison |first=Scoop |date=2024-06-13 |title=R.E.M.

In January 1980, [[Peter Buck]] met [[Michael Stipe]] in [[Wuxtry Records]], the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in [[punk rock]] and [[proto-punk]] artists like [[Patti Smith]], [[Television (band)|Television]], and [[the Velvet Underground]].

They played their first show on April 5, 1980, supported by [[The Side Effects (band)|the Side Effects]] at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers.<ref name="salon" /> After considering names such as "Cans of Piss", "Negro Eyes", and "Twisted Kites",<ref name="salon" /> the band settled on "R.E.M.", which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.{{r|Buckley|page=39}} ''R.E.M.'' is well known as an abbreviation for [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]], the dream stage of sleep; however, sleep researcher Rafael Pelayo reports that when his colleague [[William Dement]], the sleep scientist who coined the term ''REM'', reached out to the band, Dement was told that the band was named "not after REM sleep".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/883017049/the-father-of-sleep-science-dr-william-dement-dies-at-91|title='The Father Of Sleep Science' Dr. William Dement Dies At 91|website=NPR|time=1:38|access-date=June 24, 2020|archive-date=June 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200625183433/https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/883017049/the-father-of-sleep-science-dr-william-dement-dies-at-91|url-status=live}}</ref>

Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. "We made it up as we went along with people who owned bars or pizza joints or coffee shops or gay bars or biker bars," said Mills. "Anybody that wanted this kind of music there, they would make a way for it to happen in their place. It was so exciting."<ref name="Rick Beato" /> The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt (and any band member except Stipe),<ref name="Rick Beato"/> and lived on a food allowance of $2 each per day.{{r|Buckley|pages=53–54}}

In April 1981, R.E.M. recorded their first single, "[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]", at producer [[Mitch Easter]]'s [[Drive-In Studio]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], after a recommendation by [[Peter Holsapple]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabors |first=Gary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ab7oV9kevyMC&q=easter+drive-in+studio+winston-salem |title=Remnants: The R.E.M.

R.E.M. recorded the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' EP with Easter in October 1981, and planned to release it on a new indie label named Dasht Hopes.{{r|Buckley|page=59}} However, [[I.R.S.

===1982–1988: I.R.S. Records and cult success===
I.R.S. first paired R.E.M. with producer [[Stephen Hague]] to record their debut album. Hague's emphasis on technical perfection left the band unsatisfied, and the band members asked the label to let them record with Easter.{{r|Buckley|page=72}} I.R.S. agreed to a "tryout" session, allowing the band to return to [[North Carolina]] and record the song "Pilgrimage" with Easter and producing partner [[Don Dixon (musician)|Don Dixon]]. After hearing the track, I.R.S. permitted the group to record the album with Dixon and Easter.{{r|Buckley|page=78}} Because of their bad experience with Hague, the band recorded the album via a process of negation, refusing to incorporate rock music clichés such as [[guitar solo]]s or then-popular [[synthesizer]]s, in order to give its music a timeless feel.{{r|Buckley|pages=78–82}} The completed album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'', was greeted with critical acclaim upon its release in 1983, with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listing the album as its record of the year.{{r|Buckley|page=73}} The album reached number 36 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album chart.{{r|Buckley|pages=357–58}} A re-recorded version of "Radio Free Europe" was the album's lead single and reached number 78 on the ''Billboard'' singles chart in 1983.<ref>"[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/r-e-m-radio-free-europe-19691231 Radio Free Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712171106/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/r-e-m-radio-free-europe-19691231 |date=July 12, 2012 }}".

R.E.M. made their first national television appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in October 1983,{{r|Gray|page=432}} during which the group performed "Radio Free Europe" and a new, unnamed song.{{r|Gray|page=434}} The piece, eventually titled "[[So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)]]", became the first single from the band's second album, ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]'' (1984), which was also recorded with Easter and Dixon. The album was met with critical acclaim; ''NME''{{'}}s [[Mat Snow]] wrote that it "confirms R.E.M. as one of the most beautifully exciting groups on the planet".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Snow |first=Mat |title=American Paradise Regained: R.E.M.'s Reckoning |magazine=[[NME]] |date=1984}}</ref> While ''Reckoning'' peaked at number 27 on the US album charts—an unusually high chart placing for a [[college rock]] band at the time—scant airplay and poor distribution overseas resulted in it charting no higher than number 91 in Britain.{{r|Buckley|page=115}}

The band's third album, ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'' (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer [[Joe Boyd]], who had worked with [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Nick Drake]], to record the album in London. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food;{{r|Buckley|pages=131–132}} the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up.{{r|Buckley|page=135}} The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines with [[Southern Gothic]] themes, noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by "the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on&nbsp;...&nbsp;legends and fables to the grandchildren".<ref>"Interview with R.E.M.".

For their fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted [[John Mellencamp]]'s producer [[Don Gehman]]. The album, entitled ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'' (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Peter Buck related, "Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1986/10/17/onward-and-upward-and-please-yourself/|last=Popson |first=Tom |title=Onward and Upward and Please Yourself |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=October 17, 1986}}</ref> The album improved markedly upon the sales of ''Fables of the Reconstruction'' and reached number 21 on the ''Billboard'' album chart.

Following the success of ''Lifes Rich Pageant'', I.R.S. issued ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]'', a compilation of tracks recorded by the band during their album sessions, many of which had either been issued as [[B-side]]s or left unreleased altogether. Shortly thereafter, I.R.S. compiled R.E.M.'s music video catalog (except "Wolves, Lower") as the band's first video release, ''[[Succumbs]]''.

R.E.M. reconvened in mid 1990 to record their seventh album, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]''.

After spending some months off, R.E.M. returned to the studio in 1991 to record their next album. In late 1992, the band released ''[[Automatic for the People]]''. Even though the group had intended to make a harder-rocking album after the softer textures of ''Out of Time'',{{r|Buckley|page=216}} the somber ''Automatic for the People'' "[seemed] to move at an even more agonized crawl", according to ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref name="remote control">{{cite magazine |last=Fricke |first=David |title=Living Up to ''Out of Time''/Remote Control: Parts I and II |magazine=[[Melody Maker]] |date=October 3, 1992 |author-link=David Fricke}}</ref> The album dealt with themes of loss and mourning inspired by "that sense of&nbsp;... turning thirty", according to Buck.{{r|Buckley|page=218}} Several songs featured [[string instrument|string]] [[arrangement]]s by former [[Led Zeppelin]] bassist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]]. Considered by a number of critics (as well as by Buck and Mills) to be the band's best album,{{r|Buckley|page= 217}} ''Automatic for the People'' reached numbers one and two on UK and US charts, respectively, and generated the American Top 40 hit singles "[[Drive (R.E.M. song)|Drive]]", "[[Man on the Moon (R.E.M. song)|Man on the Moon]]", and "[[Everybody Hurts]]".{{r|Buckley|pages=357–58}} The album would sell over fifteen million copies worldwide.{{r|Fletcher|page=296}} As with ''Out of Time'', there was no tour in support of the album. The decision to forgo a tour, in conjunction with Stipe's physical appearance, generated rumors that the singer was dying or [[HIV-positive]], which were vehemently denied by the band.<ref name="remote control" />

{{listen|filename=R.E.M. - What's the Frequency, Kenneth?.ogg|title="What's the Frequency, Kenneth?" |description=Sample of "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?" from ''Monster'' (1994). The song's loud, distorted guitars were an intentional departure from the sound of R.E.M.'s previous two albums.}}

After the band released two slow-paced albums in a row, R.E.M.'s 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' was, as Buck said, "a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks." In contrast to the sound of its predecessors, the music of ''Monster'' consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s [[glam rock]].{{r|Buckley|page=236}} Like ''Out of Time'', ''Monster'' topped the charts in both the US and UK.{{r|Buckley|pages=357–58}} The record sold about nine million copies worldwide.{{r|Fletcher|page=296}} The singles "[[What's the Frequency, Kenneth?]]" and "[[Bang and Blame]]" were the band's last American Top 40 hits, although all the singles from ''Monster'' reached the Top 30 on the British charts.{{r|Buckley|pages=357–58}} Warner Bros. assembled the music videos from the album as well as those from ''Automatic for the People'' for release as ''[[Parallel (video)|Parallel]]'' in 1995.{{r|Fletcher|page=270}}

In January 1995, R.E.M. set out on its first tour in six years. The tour was a huge commercial success, but the period was difficult for the group.{{r|Buckley|page=248}} On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, having suffered a [[brain aneurysm]]. He had surgery immediately and recovered fully within a month. Berry's aneurysm was only the beginning of a series of health problems that plagued the ''Monster'' tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal adhesion in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery to repair a [[hernia]].{{r|Buckley|pages=251–255}} Despite all the problems, the group had recorded the bulk of a new album while on the road. The band brought along eight-track recorders to capture its shows, and used the recordings as the base elements for the album.{{r|Buckley|page=256}} The final three performances of the tour were filmed at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, Georgia, and released in home video form as ''[[Road Movie (video)|Road Movie]]''.{{r|Fletcher|page=274}}

R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a reported $80&nbsp;million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated with the media), rumored to be the largest recording contract in history at that point.{{r|Buckley|page=258}} The group's 1996 album ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK.{{r|Buckley|pages=357–58}} The five million copies of the album sold were a reversal of the group's commercial fortunes of the previous five years.{{r|Buckley|page=269}} Critical reaction to the album was mostly favorable.

In September 2021, a decade after disbanding, Stipe reiterated that R.E.M. had no intention of regrouping: "We decided when we split up that that would just be really tacky and probably money-grabbing, which might be the impetus for a lot of bands to get back together."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/michael-stipe-confirms-r-e-m-will-never-reunite-3051669 |title=Michael Stipe confirms R.E.M. will never reunite |work=NME |last=Triscari |first=Caleb |date=September 22, 2021 |access-date=September 27, 2021 |url-status=live |archive-date=September 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210924212014/https://www.nme.com/news/music/michael-stipe-confirms-r-e-m-will-never-reunite-3051669}}</ref> In 2023, R.E.M. was nominated for induction into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]<ref name="swhof">{{Cite web |url=https://americansongwriter.com/bryan-adams-patti-smith-r-e-m-ann-wilson-doobie-brothers-among-2023-songwriters-hall-of-fame-nominees/ |language=en-US |title=Bryan Adams, Patti Smith, R.E.M., Ann Wilson, Doobie Brothers Among 2023 Songwriters Hall of Fame Nominees |work=[[American Songwriter]] |last=Benitez-Eves |first=Tina |date=November 14, 2022 |access-date=November 16, 2022}}</ref> and were inducted in June 2024.<ref name="induction">{{Cite magazine |url=https://americansongwriter.com/r-e-m-steely-dan-and-timbaland-among-the-2024-inductees-into-the-songwriters-hall-of-fame/ |title=R.E.M., Steely Dan, and Timbaland Among the 2024 Inductees Into the Songwriters Hall of Fame |magazine=[[American Songwriter]] |date=2024-01-17 |access-date=2024-01-17 |language=en-US |first=Tina |last=Benitez-Eves |department=Latest News |issn=0896-8993 |oclc=17342741}}</ref> To mark this occasion, on June 13, 2024, all four founding members reunited for their first public live performance since 2007 and performed an acoustic rendition of "Losing My Religion" in New York City.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Aswad |first=Jem |date=2024-06-14 |title=R.E.M.'s Original Lineup Performs Publicly for the First Time in Nearly Three Decades at Songwriters Hall of Fame Ceremony |url=https://variety.com/2024/music/news/rem-original-lineup-live-three-decades-at-songwriters-hall-of-fame-ceremony-1236037599/ |access-date=2024-06-14 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Huhges |first=William |date=2024-06-13 |title=R.E.M. surprises Songwriters Hall Of Fame crowd with first on-stage reunion in 17 years |url=https://www.avclub.com/r-e-m-reunion-songwriters-hall-of-fame-video-1851539591 |access-date=2024-06-14 |website=[[The A.&nbsp;V.

Michael Stipe sings in what R.E.M. biographer David Buckley described as "wailing, keening, arching vocal figures".{{r|Buckley|page=87}} Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs; in the chorus for "Stand", Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue.{{r|Buckley|pages=180–181}} Early articles about the band focused on Stipe's singing style (described as "mumbling" by ''[[The Washington Post]]''), which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable.<ref name=mumble>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1984/05/10/reckoning-with-rem/bb929767-c59c-4ca9-ac56-3338bb5f9824/|author=Joe Sasfy|title= Reckoning with R.E.M.|newspaper= [[The Washington Post]]|date= May 10, 1984}}</ref> ''[[Creem]]'' writer John Morthland wrote in his review of ''Murmur'', "I still have no idea what these songs are about, because neither me nor anyone else I know has ever been able to discern R.E.M.'s lyrics."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Morthland |first=John |title=R.E.M.: Murmur |magazine=[[Creem]] |date=July 1983}}</ref> Stipe commented in 1984, "It's just the way I sing.

Stipe referred to the lyrics in the chorus of "[[Sitting Still]]" from R.E.M.'s debut album, ''Murmur'', as "nonsense", saying in a 1994 online chat, "You all know there aren't words, ''per se'', to a lot of the early stuff. I can't even remember them." In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs.{{r|Buckley|page=88}} Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there."<ref name="Platt bucketfull" /> In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level.{{r|Buckley|page=143}} Mills explained, "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes . . ."{{r|Buckley|page=150}} Songs like "Cuyahoga" and "Fall on Me" on ''Lifes Rich Pageant'' dealt with such concerns as pollution.{{r|Buckley|pages=156–157}} Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on ''Document'' and ''Green''. "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," Stipe said later. "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active."<ref name="Perth">{{cite magazine |last=Olliffe |first=Michael |title=R.E.M. in Perth |magazine=On the Street |date=January 17, 1995}}</ref> Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics.

[[File:Peter Buck Manchester - 2008.jpg|alt=Peter Buck playing guitar and smiling|thumb|left|Peter Buck's guitar-playing style has defined R.E.M.'s sound.]]

=== Instrumentation ===
Peter Buck's style of playing guitar has been singled out by many as the most distinctive aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American [[folk rock]] band [[the Byrds]].{{r|Buckley|page=77}} Buck has stated "[Byrds guitarist] [[Roger McGuinn]] was a big influence on me as a guitar player",{{r|Buckley|page=81}} but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including [[Big Star]] and [[the Soft Boys]], that inspired him more.{{r|Fletcher|page=115}} Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of [[Johnny Marr]] of alternative rock contemporaries [[the Smiths]]. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr,<ref name="date" /> whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M.{{r|Fletcher|page=115}} Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in that. I can do it if I have to, but I don't like it."{{r|Buckley|page=80}} Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by [[Paul McCartney]] of [[the Beatles]] and [[Chris Squire]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]; Mills has said, "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways . . . I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the [[kick drum]], [[root note]] bass work."{{r|Buckley|page=105}} Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality."{{r|Buckley|page=81}}

==Legacy and influence==
[[File:Pavement, the band, in Tokyo.jpg|alt=Pavement members standing before a brick wall posing in a black-and-white photo|thumb|[[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], one of several bands to name R.E.M. as an influence, wrote the song "Unseen Power of the Picket Fence" in honor of them.]]{{See also|List of awards and nominations received by R.E.M.}}
R.E.M. was pivotal in the creation and development of the alternative rock genre. [[AllMusic]] stated, "R.E.M. mark the point when [[post-punk]] turned into alternative rock."<ref name="allmusic" /> In the early 1980s, the musical style of R.E.M. stood in contrast to the post-punk and [[New wave music|new wave]] genres that had preceded it. Music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the post-punk movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s "had taken whole swaths of music off the menu", particularly that of the 1960s, and that "After postpunk's demystification and New Pop's schematics, it felt liberating to listen to music rooted in mystical awe and blissed-out surrender." Reynolds declared R.E.M., a band that recalled the music of the 1960s with its "plangent guitar chimes and folk-styled vocals" and who "wistfully and abstractly conjured visions and new frontiers for America", one of "the two most important alt-rock bands of the day."<ref>Reynolds, Simon. ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984''. Penguin, 2005. {{ISBN |0-14-303672-6}}, p. 392</ref> With the release of ''Murmur'', R.E.M. had the most impact musically and commercially of the developing alternative genre's early groups, leaving in its wake a number of [[jangle pop]] followers.<ref>{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=explore|id=essay/american-alternative-rock--post-punk-t578|pure_url=yes}} | title=American Alternative Rock / Post-Punk |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine  | publisher=AllMusic| access-date=December 3, 2010 | author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine }}</ref>

R.E.M.'s early breakthrough success served as an inspiration for other alternative bands. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' referred to the "R.E.M. model"—career decisions that R.E.M. made that set guidelines for other underground artists to follow in their own careers. ''Spin's'' Charles Aaron wrote that by 1985, "They'd shown how far an underground, punk-inspired rock band could go within the industry without whoring out its artistic integrity in any obvious way. They'd figured out how to buy in, not sellout-in other words, they'd achieved the American Bohemian Dream."<ref>{{cite book |last=Aaron |first=Charles |title=Spin: 20 Years of Alternative Music |section=The R.E.M. method and other rites of passage |publisher=[[Three Rivers Press]] |location=New York |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-307-23662-3 |edition=1st |oclc=60245596 |page=18}}</ref> [[Steve Wynn (songwriter)|Steve Wynn]] of [[Dream Syndicate]] said, "They invented a whole new ballgame for all of the other bands to follow whether it was [[Sonic Youth]] or [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] or [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] or [[Butthole Surfers]].

Throughout R.E.M.'s career, its members sought to highlight social and political issues. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', R.E.M. was considered to be one of the United States' "most liberal and politically correct rock groups."<ref>{{cite news |last=Philips |first=Chuck |title=R.E.M.'s Former Manager Denies Allegations of Sex Harassment |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 21, 1996}}</ref> The band's members were "on the same page" politically, sharing a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] outlook.{{r|Buckley|page=155}} Mills admitted that there was occasionally dissension between band members on what causes they might support, but acknowledged "Out of respect for the people who disagree, those discussions tend to stay in-house, just because we'd rather not let people know where the divisions lie, so people can't exploit them for their own purposes." An example is that in 1990 Buck noted that Stipe was involved with [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], but the rest of the band were not.{{r|Buckley|page=197}}

R.E.M. helped raise funds for environmental, feminist and human rights causes, and were involved in campaigns to encourage [[voter registration]].<ref name=":04"/> During the ''Green'' tour, Stipe spoke on stage to the audiences about a variety of socio-political issues.{{r|Buckley|page=186}} Through the late 1980s and 1990s, the band (particularly Stipe) increasingly used its media coverage on national television to mention a variety of causes it felt were important. One example is during the [[1991 MTV Video Music Awards]], Stipe wore a half-dozen white shirts emblazoned with slogans including "rainforest", "love knows no colors", and "handgun control now".{{r|Buckley|pages=195–196}}

R.E.M. helped raise awareness of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and [[Human rights in Myanmar|human rights violations in Myanmar]], when they worked with the Freedom Campaign and the [[US Campaign for Burma]].<ref>{{cite news | date=September 22, 2004 | url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3679512.stm | title=Bands back Burma activist Suu Kyi | work=[[BBC Online]] | access-date=June 30, 2007 | archive-date=September 22, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922204614/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3679512.stm | url-status=live }}</ref> Stipe himself ran ads for the 1988 election, supporting [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate and [[Massachusetts]] governor [[Michael Dukakis]] over then-Vice President [[George H.

There's no risk involved in it whatsoever, but quite a bit of shoring up of customer loyalty."{{r|Buckley|page=299}}<!-- Expand. Needs better flow -->

From the late 1980s, R.E.M. was involved in the local politics of its hometown of Athens, Georgia.{{r|Buckley|page=192}} Buck explained to ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' in 1987, "Michael always says think local and act local—we have been doing a lot of stuff in our town to try and make it a better place."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Wilkinson |first=Roy |title=The Secret File of R.E.M. |magazine=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] |date=September 12, 1987}}</ref> The band often donated funds to local charities and helped renovate and preserve historic buildings in the town.{{r|Buckley|page=194}}<ref name=":04"/> R.E.M.'s political clout was credited with the narrow election of Athens mayor Gwen O'Looney twice in the 1990s.{{r|Buckley|page=195}}<ref name=":04"/> The band is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://artistsagainstracism.org/artists/|title=Artists - Artists Against Racism|website=artistsagainstracism.org|access-date=June 19, 2018|archive-date=October 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007013905/https://artistsagainstracism.org/artists/|url-status=live}}</ref>
