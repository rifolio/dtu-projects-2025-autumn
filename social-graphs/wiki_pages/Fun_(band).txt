==History==

===2008: Career beginnings and formation===

In February 2008, [[Nate Ruess]]'s former band [[the Format]] split up. Immediately afterwards, Nate Ruess asked Andrew Dost and Jack Antonoff to join his new project. Dost had toured with the Format and provided various instrumentation, and Ruess met Antonoff after the Format toured with Steel Train.<ref>[http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=467591 Introducing: Fun.]. Retrieved June 11, 2010.</ref> The three began working together in [[New Jersey]] within a week.

Their first show was played in Denver, Colorado on November 5, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/archive_4628|title=Jack's Mannequin to play entire new album on fall tour - News - Alternative Press|website=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|date=September 3, 2008}}</ref>  A couple of early demos and covers from other bands were performed. Fun then approached Steven McDonald, who produced [[the Format]]'s album ''[[Dog Problems]]'' with Ruess, to produce their debut album. McDonald was enthusiastic about the project and stated, "I can't believe what we're working on here. This crushes anything I've ever done."<ref name="about"/>

===2009–2010: ''Aim and Ignite''===
Recording took place in the fall of 2008. The band's first single, "At Least I'm Not as Sad As I Used to Be" was made available as a free download on the band's [[Myspace]] page on April 6, 2009.<ref name="AtLeast">{{cite web |title=Dear You: Letter from Nate + new song! |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=402387619&blogId=481510377 |date=April 6, 2009 |work=Fun.'s MySpace Blog |access-date=November 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=February 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> ''[[Aim and Ignite]]'' was released on August 25, 2009, and received positive reviews.

She praised songs "Be Calm" and "The Gambler", but criticized the lyrics and production of the album's early tracks.

Shane applauded the album's songwriting and said "many of the songs are really good," but he objected to the "cute" production, desiring to hear the band "in a more stripped-down form." He ended his review with: "I have a similar problem with Dr. Dog, a band that was recommended to me by a number of people. I think much of their recorded work is too fussed over, but when I saw them live and their sound was more stripped down out of necessity, emphasizing their powerful songwriting, I thought they were wonderful.
