The band spent half the money to record the EP, while Kroeger spent the other half on [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms]]<ref name=":0" /> to resell.

===''Curb'' and ''The State'' (1996–2000)===
In 1996, the band recorded and released their first full-length album, ''[[Curb (album)|Curb]]''. "Fly" was included on both ''Hesher'' and ''Curb'' and was the first single produced by Nickelback. In 1997, Brandon Kroeger left the band and was replaced by Mitch Guindon; however, Guindon soon departed as well. While initially reported due to him starting work at a car company, Guindon's departure came due to him "not [being] meant for the road". Chad Kroeger stated that his skin was not able to handle cold weather and they convinced him to leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/nickelback-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/|title=NICKELBACK PLAY 'WIKIPEDIA: FACT OR FICTION?'|website=Loudwire.com|last=Hartman|first=Graham|date=August 23, 2017|access-date=August 6, 2020}}</ref> In Summer 1998, Ryan Vikedal joined the band.

Roadrunner [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] [[Ron Burman]] told [[HitQuarters]] that one of his [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] scouts sent him the self-released album and, suitably impressed, he travelled to Vancouver to see them perform live. Although an unknown property in the industry at the time, the venue was packed out. In Burman's words: "I immediately got the chills! I thought their song 'Leader of Men' was a smash hit."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/2002/April23_2_33_20.html |title=Interview with Ron Burman |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=April 23, 2002 |access-date=Nov 19, 2010}}</ref> Off the stage he was impressed by their industry and initiative in managing their career. Despite this, it still took Burman three months for him to convince his label bosses to approve the signing, a decision that would mark Roadrunner's first move into mainstream rock.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Nickelback signed a record deal with EMI and [[Roadrunner Records]] in 1999.

''[[The State (album)|The State]]'' was released by Nickelback in 2000 by [[Roadrunner Records]] and [[EMI|EMI Canada]], followed by its release in Europe in 2001. It spawned 4 singles: "Old Enough", "[[Worthy to Say]]", "[[Leader of Men]]" and "[[Breathe (Nickelback song)|Breathe]]", the last two being Top 10 rock hits. The album was the band's first album to be certified gold status and it later went into platinum status in 2008, after the success of their later albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=Gold & Platinum – February 14, 2010 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=February 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031458/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |archive-date=February 25, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The album entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 130 and peaked at number 3 in the Billboard Top Heatseekers albums chart and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Top Independent albums chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Awards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fxEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA55|magazine=Billboard|date= September 16, 2000}}</ref>

=== ''Silver Side Up'' and ''The Long Road'' (2001–2004) ===
Around 2001, [[Chad Kroeger]] started "studying every piece, everything sonically, everything lyrically, everything musically, chord structure. I would dissect every single song that I would hear on the radio or every song that had ever done well on a chart and I would say, 'Why did this do well?'" Kroeger said that Nickelback's single "[[How You Remind Me]]" sold so well because it was about romantic relationships, a universal subject, and contained memorable hooks.<ref name="notablebiographies2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Li-Pr/Nickelback.html |title=Nickelback Biography – born, house, time, year, Career, Sidelights, Selected discography, Sources – Newsmakers Cumulation |publisher=Notablebiographies.com |access-date=November 6, 2011}}</ref>

To record their third album ''[[Silver Side Up]]'', Nickelback collaborated with producer [[Rick Parashar]]. The album was written before the release of ''The State'' and was recorded at the same studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mattsmusicpage.com/nicbio.htm |title=Nickelback Bio |publisher=Mattsmusicpage.com |date=September 11, 2001 |access-date=November 6, 2011}}</ref> The album was released on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The album peaked at number two on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' 200 with over 177,000 copies sold in its first week and peaked at number one at the Canadian albums chart, making it the band's first album to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickelback.com/news.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020805081151/http://www.nickelback.com/news.cfm |archive-date=August 5, 2002 |date=August 5, 2002 |access-date=March 28, 2012|title=NICKELBACK – News }}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=January 2018}} The single "[[How You Remind Me]]" was a number one single on the Mainstream and Modern rock charts, as well as the pop chart.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} It also peaked at number two on [[Adult Top 40]] and became the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single of the year for 2002.

In 2002, Chad Kroeger collaborated with [[Josey Scott]] on the ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' theme song, "[[Hero (Chad Kroeger song)|Hero]]". This recording also featured [[Tyler Connolly]], Mike Kroeger, [[Matt Cameron]], and [[Jeremy Taggart]]. In 2002, Nickelback released their first DVD ''Live at Home''. On August 19, 2002, an incident occurred while the band was performing at the [[Ilha do Ermal]] festival in [[Portugal]]. While performing the second song of their set, Chad Kroeger was sprayed with a full bottle of water hurled from somewhere within the audience. After finishing the song, Chad asked the crowd, "Do you want to hear some rock 'n' roll or do you want to go home?" A person in the audience then threw a rock at Chad's head. The band then left stage, with Chad and Vikedal giving [[the finger]] to the audience as they left. The band's label, Roadrunner, posted video footage of the entire incident on their website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chartattack.com/damn/2002/08/2109.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030705100124/http://chartattack.com/damn/2002/08/2109.cfm|url-status=usurped|archive-date=July 5, 2003|title=Nickelback Get Pelted By Rocks in Portugal  |publisher=[[Chart Attack]]|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDV3ERyc0k | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/AeDV3ERyc0k| archive-date=2021-10-30|title=Nickelback sucking in Portugal | date=April 2009|via=[[YouTube]]|access-date=January 31, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===''All the Right Reasons'' (2005–2007)===
After wrapping up the band's tour in support of ''The Long Road'' on New Year's Day 2005, drummer Ryan Vikedal was fired after a royalty dispute.

The band spent much of 2006 and 2007 touring across the globe. In the fall of 2006, the band opened for [[Bon Jovi]] on the European leg of the [[Have a Nice Day Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mattsmusicpage.com/nicbio.htm |title=Nickelback Bio |publisher=Mattsmusicpage.com |date=September 11, 2001 |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> Over 2 million fans attended Nickelback's shows during those two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/nickelback-to-release-8th-album-here-and-now-november-21 |title=Nickelback To Release 8th Album, 'Here And Now', November 21 |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=February 8, 2012 |access-date=March 5, 2012}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=January 2018}}

The band played at [[Sturgis, South Dakota]] to over 35,000 people at the 2006 [[Sturgis Bike Rally]]. The performance was filmed with 15 high-definition cameras.

===''Dark Horse'' (2008–2010)===
After taking much of 2007 off, the band started recording a new album in earnest.

In a July 2021 interview [[Mike Kroeger]] commented when asked about the band's progress on new music saying "That is happening right now, music is being composed and recorded up in [[Canada]]. We were out there, and something came up and our producer had to take some time off. So I took that opportunity to return home to [[Los Angeles]] with family and spend a little time at home but I'll be headed back up there in a couple of weeks to pick it up again." When asked about a potential timeframe for a release date, Kroeger said "it'll be done when it's done", explaining that the band would rather not be confined to a timescale for fear of making "a shitty record". "Release dates are primarily arrived at by business interests, like record labels and whatever. We don't have one of those", he said. "We've been managing ourselves for about a year. So, the answer is no. We're doing it on our schedule, at our own pace, and it'll be done when it's done. 'Cause we've blown up deadlines in the past lots of times. Because we feel that you can make a good record and be late, but you can't, or you shouldn't, make a shitty record to be on time. So we won't be pressed for time.<ref>{{cite web|first=Merlin|last=Alderslade|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/nickelback-heavy-new-song|title=Nickelback are teasing a seriously heavy new song and the internet is loving it|date=August 24, 2022|access-date=September 7, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/nickelback-is-working-on-new-studio-album-itll-be-done-when-its-done|title=Nickelback is Working on New Studio Album: 'It'll be Done when It's Done'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=July 31, 2021|access-date=September 7, 2022}}</ref>

Journalist Sage Lazzaro claimed that Nickelback's negative reputation began when the band signed to [[Roadrunner Records]] and was disliked by the label's followers, which at the time was known for [[heavy metal music]]. She also wrote that a frequently-aired 2003 commercial for [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]'' contributed to this spreading when it insulted Nickelback and the commercial gained mass exposure.<ref name=":2" /> In 2014, Angelica Leicht of ''[[Houston Press]]'' conferred the title of "the reigning [[Butt rock|butt-rock]] band always and forever" on Nickelback.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leicht |first=Angelica |title=Top 10 Butt-Rock Bands of All Time |url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/top-10-butt-rock-bands-of-all-time-6519109 |access-date=June 25, 2025 |website=Houston Press}}</ref> During 2018, the band was defended in a teaser trailer for the film ''[[Once Upon a Deadpool]]'' by the [[Wade Wilson (film character)|title character]].
