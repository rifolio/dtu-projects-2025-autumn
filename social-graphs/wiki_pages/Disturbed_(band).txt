==History==

===Early years (1994–1996)===
Before [[David Draiman]] joined Disturbed, guitarist [[Dan Donegan]], drummer [[Mike Wengren]] and bassist Steve "Fuzz" Kmak were in a band called Brawl with vocalist Erich Awalt. Before changing their name to "Brawl", however, Donegan mentioned in the band's DVD, ''Decade of Disturbed'', that the name was originally going to be "Crawl"; they switched it to "Brawl", because the name was already being used by another band. Awalt left the band shortly after the recording of a demo tape; the other three members advertised for a singer. They posted an advertisement in the local music publication in Chicago, Illinois, called the "Illinois Entertainer".<ref name="M.O.L. DVD">{{cite AV media notes |title=M.O.L. |others=Nathan "Karma" Cox  |year=2002}}</ref> Draiman answered the advertisement after going to twenty other auditions that month.<ref name="M.O.L. DVD" /> Guitarist Dan Donegan commented on Draiman: "You know, out of all the singers that we had talked to or auditioned, he [Draiman] was the only singer who was ready to go with originals. And that impressed me, just to attempt that".<ref name="M.O.L. DVD" />

With regard to Draiman being the singer for the band, Donegan said, "After a minute or two, he just starts banging out these melodies that were huge...I'm playing my guitar and I'm grinning from ear to ear, trying not to give it away that I like this guy, you know, because I don't want to, you know...[say] 'Yeah, we'll give you a call back. We'll, you know, discuss it.' But I was so psyched. Chill up my spine. I'm like, 'There is something here.'" As drummer Mike Wengren commented, "We clicked right off the bat."<ref name="M.O.L. DVD"/> Draiman then joined the band in 1996, and the band was renamed Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he suggested to name the band "Disturbed", Draiman said, "It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.concertlivewire.com/interviews/disturbed.htm |title=David Draiman of Disturbed Interview&nbsp;— One on One |publisher=concertlivewire.com |date=February 19, 2005 |access-date=March 6, 2009}}</ref>

===''The Sickness'' (1997–2000)===
After renaming the band, Disturbed went on to record two three-track demo tapes, the first containing demos for [[The Game (Disturbed song)|"The Game"]], "[[Down with the Sickness]]", and "Meaning of Life", while the second had demos for "Want", "[[Stupify]]", and "Droppin' Plates". The artwork was composed of the band's newly created mascot, The Guy. The band eventually signed with [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] in August 1999 and opened for [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] at Chicago's [[Riviera Theatre]] around the same time.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dan Donegan [@DanDoneganGtr]|title=Tweet from August 7, 2019|url=https://twitter.com/DanDoneganGtr/status/1158946881701109761|access-date=May 19, 2021|website=[[Twitter]]}}</ref> In 2000, the band released its debut album, titled ''[[The Sickness]]'', which launched the band into stardom.

===''Divisive'' (2021–2024)===
Following a break, the band played its first pandemic-era live shows. The first one was the first time in nearly two years on September 25, 2021, as one of the headliners of the [[Louder Than Life]] festival in Louisville, Kentucky. The band also played later in November at the [[Welcome to Rockville]] festival at the [[Daytona International Speedway]] in Daytona Beach, Florida.

Draiman talked about the progress of the songwriting sessions for the band's follow-up to 2018's ''Evolution'': "It's on in a big, big, big fucking way. It really, really is. I mean, we are so genuinely excited." He also said that the new material is going back to their "meat and potatoes", and that it is close to the vibe of ''The Sickness'' and ''Ten Thousand Fists'' albums.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/david-draiman-says-disturbed-wont-put-out-traditional-full-length-album-two-separate-releases-planned/|title = DAVID DRAIMAN Says DISTURBED Won't Put Out 'Traditional Full-Length' Album; Two Separate Releases Planned|website=Blabbermouth.net|date = November 18, 2021}}</ref> Draiman said that the band wants to begin recording after the New Year of 2022, but they have yet to announce a producer.

''Believe'' is also considered by several critics to be a step away from the [[nu metal]] sound featured on ''[[The Sickness]]'', moving towards a more [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound that was continued in their following albums.<ref name="411mania.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.411mania.com/music/album_reviews/822/Disturbed-%E2%80%93-Ten-Thousand-Fists-Review.htm |title=Disturbed – Ten Thousand Fists Review |first=Brandon |last=Ratliff |publisher=411 Mania |access-date=April 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025061035/http://www.411mania.com/music/album_reviews/822/Disturbed-%E2%80%93-Ten-Thousand-Fists-Review.htm |archive-date=October 25, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="blender.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/new/50905/believe.html |title=Review Disturbed Believe |first=Ben |last=Mitchell |publisher=Blender |access-date=April 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025050947/http://www.blender.com/guide/new/50905/believe.html |archive-date=October 25, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="ew.com">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,350620,00.html |title=Music Review Believe (2002) Disturbed |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |first=Josh |last=Tyrangiel |date=September 20, 2002 |access-date=April 27, 2010 |archive-date=August 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803092443/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,350620,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1382607|pure_url=yes}} |title=Indestructible – Disturbed |author=James Christopher Monger |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=April 27, 2010}}</ref>

=== Lyrics ===
According to frontman David Draiman on the band home documentary ''[[M.O.L.]]'', the lyrics that he writes are inspired by actual experiences of his own, and he stated that he likes to present his ideas with cryptic lyrics.<ref name="M.O.L. DVD" />
These lyrical themes range from the [[Judeo-Christian]] concept of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]], [[domestic abuse]], [[suicide]], [[insanity]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], war, to more fantastical themes, such as [[vampire|vampirism]], [[werewolf|werewolves]] and [[demon]]s. Many of the band's post-hiatus releases have featured political lyrics.

=== Influences ===
They have often cited their influences as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Metallica]], [[Pantera]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Queensrÿche]], and [[Soundgarden]].<ref name="Brinn">{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Music/The-hazan-who-became-Disturbed|title=The hazan who became disturbed|first=Davd|last=Brinn|date=January 2, 2011|work=The Jerusalem Post}}</ref> Draiman's main influences came from funk-infused bands such as [[Faith No More]], and he expresses much admiration for Faith No More singer [[Mike Patton]].<ref name=anniversary/><ref>{{cite web|access-date=January 30, 2021|url=http://newfaithnomore.com/2009/05/22/bands-love-faith-no-more/|title=David Draiman interview|publisher=Fangoria Online |date=2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007180133/http://newfaithnomore.com/2009/05/22/bands-love-faith-no-more/|archive-date=October 7, 2010}}<!-- Original dead link: http://fangoriaonline.com/musick/musick-news/2554-exclusive-talking-horror-with-david-draiman-of-disturbed.html --></ref>

Disturbed's mascot, named "The Guy", was originally a drawing of a face with a large grin, as seen on the back of the album ''[[The Sickness]]''. The original drawing of The Guy was then edited using a digital distorting program. After the original image had been distorted three times, The Guy became the band's official mascot.
