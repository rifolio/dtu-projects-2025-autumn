In December 1966, producer Bob Crewe's vision for Mitch as a blue-eyed soul singer backed by a horn band (a la [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Joe Tex]], etc.) was put into motion. They assembled a 10 piece band of white R&B musicians: from [[Baltimore, Maryland]]; Jimmy Wilson (trumpet), Bob Shipley (sax), Jimmy Loomis (sax), Don Lehnhoff (trombone), Frank Invernizzi (organ); from Chicago, Illinois; [[John Siomos]] (drums), Bob Slawson (guitar), Carmine Riale (bass guitar); from Miami, Florida; Andy Dio (trumpet); from New York; Johnny ? (lead guitar). The band rehearsed for a month in a dance studio above [[Cheetah (nightclub)|Cheetah]], a night club at Broadway and 53rd,<ref name=MRSBB>{{cite web |url=https://baltimorejam.org/Mitch%20Ryder%20Band/MRSBB.html |publisher=baltimorejam.org |title=Mitch Ryder Show "Baltimore Band" |access-date=October 11, 2024}}</ref> then hit the road as The Mitch Ryder Show in February 1967.

Ryder was the last person to perform with [[Otis Redding]]; they performed the song "[[Knock on Wood (Eddie Floyd song)|Knock On Wood]]", on December 9, 1967, in Cleveland, Ohio, on a local TV show called ''[[Upbeat (TV program)|Upbeat]]''. Redding and four members of his touring band, [[The Bar-Kays]], died in a plane crash near Madison, Wisconsin the following day, December 10, 1967.

Ryder's musical endeavors were less successful after the early 1970s.<ref name="Larkin"/> Ryder's participation with the Detroit Wheels ended just as the [[counterculture]] was becoming dominant in 1968. During 1968, trumpeters Mike Thuroff and John Stefan were hired to tour with his horn section and band. Thuroff and Stefan also recorded the trumpet parts of Ryder's song, "Ring My Bell". This song was not permitted to be played by radio in many states due to its sexual innuendos. Ryder had one hit single from that period, a cover version of "[[What Now My Love (song)|What Now, My Love]]". In the early 70's, he formed the band [[Detroit (band)|Detroit]]. The only other original Wheel in the group was the drummer [[Johnny "Bee" Badanjek|John Badanjek]]; other members were guitarists [[Steve Hunter]], [[Brett Tuggle]], organist Harry Phillips, and bassist W.R. Cooke. A single album was released by this grouping, a 1971 self-titled [[long play|LP]] issued on [[Paramount Records (1969)|Paramount Records]] (US #176 in 1972). They had a hit with their version of the [[Lou Reed]]-penned song "[[Rock & Roll (The Velvet Underground song)|Rock & Roll]]", which Reed liked enough to ask Steve Hunter to join his backing band. Detroit was tagged by the critics as the "American Rolling Stones".  

According to [[AllMusic]] (which calls Ryder "the unsung hero" of Michigan rock and roll), Ryder withdrew from music in 1973 after experiencing throat trouble,<ref name="Larkin"/> moving to Colorado with his wife and taking up writing and painting. In 1983, Ryder returned to a major label with the [[John Mellencamp]]-produced album ''Never Kick a Sleeping Dog''. The album featured a cover version of the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] song "[[When You Were Mine (Prince song)|When You Were Mine]]", which was Ryder's last score on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Ryder continues to record and tour in the United States and Europe. In 2005, Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/68-mitch-ryder-a-the-detroit-wheels|title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends - MITCH RYDER & THE DETROIT WHEELS|website=Michiganrockandrolllegends.com|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref> In 2009, Mitch Ryder was inducted as a solo artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/106-mitch-ryder|title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends - MITCH RYDER|website=Michiganrockandrolllegends.com|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref> On February 14, 2012, Ryder released ''The Promise'', his first US release in almost 30 years.<ref name="bmansbluesreport1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bmansbluesreport.com/2012/02/new-release-mitch-ryder-promise-review.html |title=Bman's Blues Report: New Release: Mitch Ryder – The Promise – Review |publisher=Bmansbluesreport.com |date=February 2, 2012 |access-date=April 24, 2012}}</ref>

==Influence==
[[File:Mitch Ryder(ThKraft).jpg|thumb|Ryder in 2008]]
Ryder has influenced the music of such [[blue collar]] rock music artists as [[Bob Seger]], [[John Mellencamp]], and also [[Bruce Springsteen]],<ref name="Larkin"/> whose version of the song "Devil With a Blue Dress" was part of the ''[[No Nukes]]'' concert album in the early 1980s. He has also been cited as a primary musical influence by [[Ted Nugent]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music-illuminati.com/interview-with-ted-nugent/ |title=Interview with Ted Nugent|publisher=Music-illuminati.com|access-date=March 22, 2013}}</ref>

In concert, Bruce Springsteen has often featured a performance informally known as "Detroit Medley" that includes the songs "Devil with a Blue Dress", "Jenny Take a Ride", "[[Good Golly, Miss Molly|Good Golly Miss Molly]]" and "[[See See Rider|C.C. Rider]]". The medley from time to time blends in a variety of other songs, but this remains the core section, often featuring guitar solos from Springsteen and piano solos by Roy Bittan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theimmortaljukebox.com/2016/04/01/mitch-ryder-and-the-detroit-wheels-burn-rubber-and-inspire-bruce-springsteen/|title=Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels burn rubber and inspire Bruce Springsteen!|first=Thom|last=Hickey|website=Theimmortaljukebox.com|date=April 1, 2016|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref>

[[Winona Ryder]], the stage name of Winona Laura Horowitz, was inspired by Mitch Ryder's music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/bio/winona_ryder.shtml |title= Winona Ryder Biography|publisher=Netglimse.com|access-date=March 22, 2013}}</ref>

Ryder has been credited by guitarist [[Steve Hunter]] for giving Hunter his first real break in rock and roll and introducing Hunter to producer [[Bob Ezrin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockguitardaily.blogspot.com/2013/07/steve-hunter-rock-guitar-daily-interview.html |title=Steve Hunter - The Rock Guitar Daily Interview |last=Conley |first=Tony |publisher=Rock Guitar Daily |date=July 22, 2013 |access-date=April 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712024030/http://rockguitardaily.blogspot.com/2013/07/steve-hunter-rock-guitar-daily-interview.html |archive-date=July 12, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2017 he was inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame.

[[Ritchie Blackmore]] acknowledged the influence of Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels on the type of beat [[Deep Purple]] chose for their version of "[[Kentucky Woman]]", the song by [[Neil Diamond]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sexton|first=Paul|date=December 6, 2020|title='Kentucky Woman': Ritchie Blackmore Remembers Deep Purple 1968|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/ritchie-blackmore-remembers-deep-purple-mk/|access-date=December 21, 2020|website=uDiscover Music|language=en-US}}</ref>
