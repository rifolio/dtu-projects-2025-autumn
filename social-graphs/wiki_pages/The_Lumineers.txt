==History==
===2002–2009: Early years===
When Schultz and Fraites began collaborating, writing together and playing gigs around New York City, they did so under various names, including Free Beer, 6Cheek and Wesley Jeremiah.<ref name=Laudadio2013>{{cite magazine|last=Laudadio|first=Marisa|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20665871,00.html|title=Five Things to Know About The Lumineers|magazine=People|date=January 19, 2013|access-date=May 10, 2015|archive-date=May 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518090527/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20665871,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Fraites elaborated, "When Wes and I got together, our first band name was Free Beer. It wasn't serious at first. We were a crappy band doing (terrible) covers. But we slowly started getting away from covers and writing originals. We were doing everything: vanilla singer-songwriter stuff, hard rock, electronic music. There was no focus; it was a mad, random mess."<ref name=Kot2012>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/2012/04/12/lumineers-specialize-in-audience-participation/|title=Lumineers specialize in audience participation|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=April 12, 2012|access-date=May 10, 2015}}</ref>  According to Schultz, the band became The Lumineers after a band called Lumineers (a made up word) were supposed to play at a club in [[Jersey City]] the week after Schultz and Fraites played there.<ref name= People>{{cite magazine |last=Laudadio |first=Melissa |date=January 19, 2013 |title=Five Things to Know About The Lumineers |url=https://people.com/awards/five-things-to-know-about-the-lumineers/ |magazine=People |location=New York, NY }}</ref> The [[emcee]] mistakenly introduced Schultz and Fraites as ''The'' Lumineers, and the name stuck.<ref name="People"/>

The Lumineers struggled to find success in New York according to Schultz, who said, "I was living in Brooklyn and working three jobs just to pay the rent," adding, "it was really infuriating to move to a city that would help us grow musically but then never have any time to work on music. So I decided to do something about it." In 2009, after considering relocating to [[London]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Boston]], Fraites and Schultz, in their "ignorance and naïveté", moved to Denver, Colorado, and joined the [[open mic|open mic scene]]. Before the move, while the band was still called Wesley Jeremiah, they had a former member, Jason "Jay" Van Dyke play with them rarely. Van Dyke sued The Lumineers around 2008, claiming that Schultz and Fraites didn't give him the proper credit he deserved. Later Schultz and Fraites acknowledged Van Dyke, and admitted that they performed for a short period of time. Van Dyke claims that he co-wrote nine songs with Schultz and Fraites.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/cultural_attache/2015/02/lumineers-reject-claims-made-in-new-jersey.html| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150214023913/http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/cultural_attache/2015/02/lumineers-reject-claims-made-in-new-jersey.html| archive-date = February 14, 2015| title = Lumineers reject claims made in New Jersey musician's lawsuit - Denver Business Journal}}</ref><ref name=Kot2012/><ref name=Pareles2013>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/arts/music/the-lumineers-strange-road-to-the-top-10.html?_r=0|title=Go West, Young Band|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 10, 2013|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> The parties settled the lawsuit in 2017, with the terms of the settlement confidential.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/892002/lumineers-settle-with-ex-bandmate-over-song-copyrights|title= Lumineers Settle With Ex-Bandmate Over Song Copyrights |newspaper=Law360| author=Dorothy Atkins |date=February 14, 2017|access-date=October 25, 2024}}</ref>

Schultz has stated, "I write the lyrics, and I co-write the songs with Jer," adding "It's never the same thing with each song. Generally speaking it involves a piano, a guitar, and maybe singing, and we usually start out with the chord structure, a set of chords, a melody especially, and then the lyrics usually follow.  Or it's one phrase that you really find great and then you build the song around that."<ref name=riggs2012>{{cite magazine|last=Riggs|first=Liz|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/04/chatting-it-up-with-the-lumineers/|title=Chatting It Up With: The Lumineers|magazine=American Songwriter|date=April 26, 2012|access-date=May 10, 2015}}</ref> Schultz later claimed, "Your melodies make people want to hear what you're saying," adding, "They've got to be open to hearing it, almost hum it. And if they want to go deeper there is something there."<ref name=Pareles2013/>

Fraites emphasizes the simplicity of the group's style, stating, "we're not reinventing the wheel or doing anything that different, the songs are super simple. The ideas themselves are very simple ideas. Anyone who can play an instrument can play a Lumineers song. I think there's a certain cinematic aspect of our music that I really like."<ref name= Crimson>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Francie|title=Colorado bands brings folk music to Birmingham|url=http://cw.ua.edu/2012/09/13/colorado-bands-brings-folk-music-to-birmingham/ |access-date=September 14, 2012| publisher = University of Alabama | newspaper=The Crimson White|date=September 13, 2012}}</ref> ''Launchpad'' similarly writes, "where most bands these days look for that new, original sound to enhance the digital revolution, 'The Lumineers' do superbly in taking it back to simplicity."<ref>{{cite web|author=Ben|url=http://www.launchpadvenue.com/article/lumineers-album-review|title=The Lumineers: Album Review|type=album review|website=Launchpadvenue.com|date=November 5, 2012|access-date=April 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415054927/http://www.launchpadvenue.com/article/lumineers-album-review|archive-date=April 15, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In another interview, Fraites explains, "I just think people are enamored of going into a room and watching people play their own instruments and sing, rather than using [[Auto-Tune]] and a lot of digital equipment to get their sound across. There is so much digital-ness all around us. People are almost taken aback when you do the opposite of that. It's inspiring."<ref name=Kot2012/>

Alister Roberts of ''Contactmusic'' has described the band's self-titled debut album as, "a perfectly formed collection of rustic folk type songs, slotting in nicely amongst the current roots revival."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Roberts|first=Alister|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/album-review/the-lumineers-the-lumineers|title=The Lumineers – The Lumineers Album Review|type = album review|magazine=Contactmusic|date=November 6, 2012|access-date=April 13, 2015}}</ref> Their folk sound has received comparisons to [[Mumford & Sons]].<ref name=Ratliff2013>{{cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/arts/music/at-the-grammys-new-appreciation-for-the-old-days.html|title=New Appreciation for the Old Days: A Little Bit Raw|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 11, 2013|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Rutherford2015>{{cite web|last=Rutherford|first=Kevin|url=http://radio.com/2015/03/09/mumford-sons-bet-it-all-on-electric-guitars/|title=Mumford & Sons Bet It All On Electric Guitars|website=Radio.com|date=March 9, 2015|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> On Mumford & Sons, Schultz has commented that they, "kicked down doors, and they allowed radio to receive a band like us because we somehow slightly resemble what they're doing."<ref name=Pareles2013/> Jon Pareles of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that, "Mumford comparisons rankle the Lumineers. While both bands wrap moody lyrics in toe-tapping melodies, Mumford & Sons pile on instruments in massive buildups.

Other artists have commented on the folk-style music of The Lumineers and Mumford & Sons; [[alternative rock]] artist [[Jack White]] praised the style, stating, "I think these acts nowadays are keeping people's ears open to the idea of the soulfulness of folk-style music and acoustic music, and you get a little bit closer to the musician, to the writer, at times."<ref name=Hogan2013>{{cite magazine|last=Hogan|first=Marc|url=http://www.spin.com/2013/02/jack-white-praises-mumford-sons-lumineers-success/|title=Jack White Raves About Mumford & Sons and the Lumineers' 'Beautiful' Success|magazine=Spin|date=February 27, 2013|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Conversely, [[hard rock|hard]] and [[shock rock]] artist [[Alice Cooper]] criticized the two bands, calling it "an offense" to label them rock bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/13/alice-cooper-slams-mumford-and-sons_n_3591564.html|title=Alice Cooper Slams Mumford & Sons And The Lumineers, Says Labeling Them Rock Bands Is 'An Offense'|website=Huffington Post|date=July 13, 2013|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/alice-cooper/71420|title=Alice Cooper: 'Calling Mumford And Sons a rock band is an offence to rock 'n' roll'|publisher=NME|date=July 13, 2013|access-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref>

That is the moment I took away from his show. This taught me everything I needed to know."<ref name=Mateer2012/>
