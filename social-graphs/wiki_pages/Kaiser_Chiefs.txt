==History==
===Runston Parva (1996–2000)===
When they were around eleven years old, Nick Hodgson, Nick Baines and Simon Rix met in the same class at [[St. Mary's Catholic High School, Menston]], West Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/image_galleries/music_musical_map_of_leeds_gallery.shtml?10-|title=BBC Leeds – Musical Map of Leeds|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> After leaving school, Rix and Baines left for university in 1996 whereas Hodgson remained in the Leeds area, meeting both Andrew White and Ricky Wilson. Hodgson, White and Wilson formed the band Runston Parva, a deliberate misspelling of a small [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] hamlet called [[Ruston Parva]]. After Runston Parva failed to secure a record deal, the group re-formed as Parva upon the return of Rix and Baines from university.

===Parva and ''22'' (2000–2003)===
Parva's career went beyond the boundaries of Leeds, and the band was able to obtain both a record and publishing deal. However, after [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]] closed the [[Mantra Recordings|Mantra]] label, Parva were dropped and without any direction after the release of an album (''22'') and three singles ("Heavy", "Good Bad Right Wrong" and "Hessles").

According to manager James Sandom in an interview with [[HitQuarters]], as a dropped band they had become damaged goods, "No one would touch them because they had a history. A lot of people used their history against them."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_James_Sandom_Interview.html |title=Interview with James Sandom |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=28 May 2007 |access-date=17 November 2010}}</ref> The band decided that they would aim for a longer-term record deal and started afresh with new songs and a new name: Kaiser Chiefs. The new name was taken from South African football club [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]], the first club of ex-[[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] captain [[Lucas Radebe]].<ref name="Kaiser Chiefs Interview">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/content/articles/2005/04/14/kaiser_chiefs_interview.shtml|title=BBC - South Yorkshire - Entertainment - Kaiser Chiefs interview|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Manager James Sandom was tipped off about the band by [[Drowned in Sound]] founder Sean Adams, who persuaded him to go and see them live. Sandom said: "I went to see a couple of shows and you were just bombarded by a series of potential hit singles." Soon after Sandom became their manager, Kaiser Chiefs signed to [[B-Unique Records]]. [[Atlantic Records]] had also made an offer for the band.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>

=== ''Stay Together'' (2016–2017) ===
''[[Stay Together (album)|Stay Together]]'', the band's sixth studio album, was released on 7 October 2016. It was co-written and produced by [[Brian Higgins(producer)|Brian Higgins]], whose production company [[Xenomania]] has worked with the likes of [[Girls Aloud]] and [[Pet Shop Boys]]. The album's name is a reference to the song "We Stay Together".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/kaiser-chiefs/music/listen-kaiser-chiefs-unveil-parachute-single/#hOwt3Dfjk7RI9FQ3.97|title=LISTEN: KAISER CHIEFS UNVEIL PARACHUTE SINGLE {{!}} Radiox.co.uk/|last=Radiox.co.uk|website=Radiox.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=13 June 2016|archive-date=9 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009084350/http://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/kaiser-chiefs/music/listen-kaiser-chiefs-unveil-parachute-single/#hOwt3Dfjk7RI9FQ3.97|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/kaiser-chiefs/91644|title=Kaiser Chiefs working on new album of love songs |website=Nme.com|language=en-GB|access-date=7 May 2016}}</ref> The first single from the album, "[[Parachute (Kaiser Chiefs song)|Parachute]]", was released on 14 June 2016. The second single, "Hole In My Soul" was released 18 August 2016 and the third and final single, "We Stay Together" was released on 9 December 2016.

This welcome return to the limelight saw ‘Stay Together’ push new boundaries to "take this nondescript sound and stuff it impressively full of sing-a-long hooks, covering topics including monogamy (We Stay Together) and shagging (Good Clean Fun)" as it marked an entirely new direction for the band, who went for a more dance-oriented sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/kaiser-chiefs-stay-together-review-caroline|title=Kaiser Chiefs: Stay Together review – nondescript but still full of hooks|website=The Guardian|date=6 October 2016|access-date=17 May 2017|last1=Aroesti|first1=Rachel}}</ref> While ''[[Education, Education, Education and War]]'' was more focused on politics and the perils of war, the Kaiser Chiefs made the album with a focus on love and relationships. Wilson elaborated further on the stark contrast between this last album and 'Stay Together': "The thing about writing a protest album is it's straightforward. Only an idiot would disagree with you. You're just saying war is bad. But when you start talking about relationships like on this record it's harder because there's a lot more blurred line. There's no right or wrong."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trefor|first1=Cai|title=Kaiser Chiefs' Ricky Wilson Opens Up About New Album Stay Together|url=http://www.gigwise.com/blogs/108272/kaiser-chiefs-stay-together-new-album-parachute-hole-in-my-soul|website=Gigwise|access-date=13 October 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014061046/http://www.gigwise.com/blogs/108272/kaiser-chiefs-stay-together-new-album-parachute-hole-in-my-soul|archive-date=14 October 2016}}</ref>

The band performed a string of best of forest shows in the summer of 2016 as part the ''[[Forestry Commission]]'''s ''Forest Live'' series. Stay Together was toured across Europe in early 2017.

===''Duck'' (2018–2021)===
The band signed with their original label [[Polydor Records]] for their seventh studio album, ''[[Duck (album)|Duck]]'', which released on 26 July 2019. For the album the band reunited with [[Ben H. Allen]], the producer who worked on the band's 2014 album ''[[Education, Education, Education & War]]''. The album was preceded by a UK tour in January and February, including concerts at London's [[O2 Academy Brixton]] and [[O2 Academy Birmingham]], where several new songs from the album were premiered. The band also played a homecoming show at Elland Road in Leeds on 8 June 2019, which was also to celebrate 100 years of [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United.]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kaiser Chiefs To Celebrate 100 Years Of Leeds United With Elland Road Gig |url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/kaiser-chiefs/celebrate-100-years-leeds-united-elland-road-gig/ |access-date=2024-05-06 |website=Radio X |language=en}}</ref>
