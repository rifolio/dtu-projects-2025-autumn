Fender is known for his [[Scientific pitch notation|high]] [[tenor]] voice and strong [[Geordie]] accent ([[North East England]]).<ref name="Jeffers2021"/> His manager said he was "totally struck by this incredible voice" when Fender, then 18, began singing under the encouragement of his boss at Low Lights Tavern.<ref name="Marshall2021"/> Moon described his voice as "earnest" with [[keening]] harmonies. Fender has stated that he tends to sing at the top of his [[vocal range]] when writing and performing, saying he is "always [[Belting (music)|belting]]."<ref name="Moon2021"/> Ellie Harrison of ''[[The Independent]]'' regarded Fender's voice as "big and [[Vocal resonation|sonorous]]" and [[Musical expression|expressing]] "moments of vulnerability".<ref name="Harrison2019"/> ''The Telegraph''{{'}}s James Hall wrote that his live vocals were "rich and vibrant" in the [[Head voice|upper register]], particularly on medium tempo songs like "Mantra".<ref name="Hall2022"/> Petridis observed that in ascending [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] on the song "Aye", Fender's voice "takes on the keening quality" of [[John Lydon]].<ref name="Petridis2021"/>

===Songwriting===
Fender told ''Billboard'' in 2019 that he was entering a phase of writing lyrics first due to his enjoyment of "just writing poetry or just writing freeform".<ref name="Reitman2019"/> Fender mostly writes songs on the piano and converts them to the guitar, continuing the creative development to find slight variations of chords on the latter.<ref name="Jeffers2021"/> Byrne argued that Fender distinguished himself as "an artist interested in expressing lived emotion" when releasing his series of singles from 2017.<ref name="Byrne2018"/> ''Rolling Stone'' music columnist Tim Ingham observed a "near-complete decline of the solo singer-songwriter pop hit" over the previous decade in 2019 and described Fender as "a rarity in the modern music industry: a major label priority act&nbsp;... who entirely writes all of his own material".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Ingham |first=Tim |date=1 April 2019 |title=Hardly Anyone on the Pop Charts Writes Their Own Music (Alone) Anymore |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/hardly-anyone-in-the-pop-charts-writes-their-own-music-alone-anymore-815333/ |url-status=live |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220202021157/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/hardly-anyone-in-the-pop-charts-writes-their-own-music-alone-anymore-815333/ |archive-date=2 February 2022 |access-date=5 March 2022}}</ref>

[[Triple J]]'s Al Newstead wrote that ''Hypersonic Missiles'' "introduced him as a songwriter with skill, honesty, and a great love for anthemic rock". Newstead further said that Fender "embrace the voice-of-a-generation mantle thrust upon him" on the first two albums' [[protest song#20th century|politically charged songs]] but, by contrast, is more effective at addressing mental health-related topics and personal experiences.<ref name="Newstead2021"/> Moon deemed Fender's lyrics "powerful, poetic, personal" and his songwriting "descriptive", imbued with reality and details, exemplified in the lyrics of "The Dying Light", "This town is a world of waifs and strays, comedy giants, penniless heroes/Dead men at the bar, I drank with them all."<ref name="Moon2021"/> Petridis felt he moved away from Springsteen's influence on the second album and noted a significant improvement in the lyrical department through an approach to songwriting that placed greater autobiographical emphasis with the addition of romantic, novelistic aspects.<ref name="Petridis2021"/>

The urban environment and local [[pub]]s' atmosphere often serve as a thematic framework for his songs. Songs provide the narrative of his personal experiences and those of his friends, ranging from "troubled childhoods", working class life in North Shields, to [[Suicide in the United Kingdom|male suicides]].<ref name="Marshall2021"/> His songs also addressed communication, romantic failures, and relationships&mdash;including "complicated" ones between fathers and sons. Some lyrics were about self-esteem and growing up in England, whilst others chronicled the country's political spectrum and the ensuing tensions.<ref name="Jeffers2021"/> Others thematically refer to teenage life, friendship, mental health,<ref>{{cite news |last=Skinner |first=Tom |date=14 December 2021 |title=Sam Fender live in Leeds: close-quarters party from rock's rising star |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/sam-fender-live-in-leeds-brudenell-social-club-review-3116399 |url-status=live |work=NME |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211214110230/https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/sam-fender-live-in-leeds-brudenell-social-club-review-3116399 |archive-date=14 December 2021 |access-date=12 February 2022}}</ref> poverty,<ref name="Hutchinson2019"/> "toxic masculinity",<ref name="Trendell2018"/> [[social media addiction]], and "faceless" [[Political corruption|politicians]].<ref name="Smirke2019"/> ''Seventeen Going Under'' was described as Fender "turning the mirror on himself; his adolescence and the trials and tribulations of growing up", with North Shields as "the ever-present backdrop".<ref name="Lavin2021"/>

In 2022, some of his lyrics are being used for English teaching to [[Year 9]] pupils as part of the [[Key Stage 3]] [[National Curriculum for England]] at Whitley Bay High School due to the quality of their writing and "certain messages" conveyed that "resonate with young people".<ref name="AM2022-02-07"/>
