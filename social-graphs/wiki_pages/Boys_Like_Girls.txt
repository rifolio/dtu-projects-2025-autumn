===Departure of Bryan Donahue and ''Crazy World'' (2010–2013)===
The group began working on their third studio album in 2010. However, it was scrapped after they felt that the album was "disingenuous." According to Johnson, the album originally leaned into an [[electro-pop]] hybrid sound and "didn't really feel like Boys Like Girls."<ref name="Billboard BLG">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/boys-like-girls-frowned-on-third-album-so-they-scrapped-it-474010/|title=Boys Like Girls Frowned on Third Album, So They Scrapped It|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author=Emily Zemler|date=November 26, 2012|access-date=March 11, 2025}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Stylistically, the band lists its musical influences as a variety of contemporary band in genres such as punk, emo pop, and alternative rock, such as [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Blink-182]], [[Secondhand Serenade]], [[Relient K]], [[The Academy Is...]], and [[Dashboard Confessional]]. The punk rock influence is most evident in their guitar and drums style. Given Johnson's characteristic [[tenor]] vocal melodies, the band's all-around sound is more closely geared to late '90s [[alternative rock|alternative]] radio rock, along the lines of [[Vertical Horizon]], [[Goo Goo Dolls]], and [[Eve 6]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=155798 |title=Album Review: Boys Like Girls – Boys Like Girls |first=Tony |last=Pascarella |work=Absolutepunk.net |access-date=October 19, 2006 |archive-date=May 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525204534/http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=155798 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
