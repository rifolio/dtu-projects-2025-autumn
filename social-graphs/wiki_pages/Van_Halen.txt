'''Van Halen''' ({{IPAc-en|v|æ|n|_|ˈ|h|eɪ|l|ə|n}} {{respell|van|_|HAY|len}}) was an American rock band formed in [[Pasadena, California]], in 1972.

From 1974 to 1985, Van Halen consisted of guitarist, keyboardist, backing vocalist and primary songwriter Eddie Van Halen, his brother, drummer [[Alex Van Halen]], lead vocalist [[David Lee Roth]], and bassist [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]].<ref name="Van Halen"/> Upon its release in 1978, the band's [[Van Halen (album)|self-titled debut album]] reached No. 19 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold over 10 million copies in the United States, achieving a [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). By 1982, the band had released four more albums: ''[[Van Halen II]]'' (1979), ''[[Women and Children First]]'' (1980), ''[[Fair Warning (Van Halen album)|Fair Warning]]'' (1981), and ''[[Diver Down]]'' (1982), all of which have been certified multi-platinum. By the early 1980s, Van Halen was among the most commercially successful rock acts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/35-years-later-van-halens-1984-remains-a-high-water-mark-for-the-band-11103309|title=Van Halen's 1984 Turns 35 Today, Is At Least The Second Best Work With That Title|first=Pete |last=Vonder Haar|date=January 9, 2019|newspaper=[[Houston Press]]}}</ref> The album ''[[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]'', released in the eponymous year, was a commercial success with U.S. sales of 10 million copies and four successful singles. Its lead single, "[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]", was the band's only number-one single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]] lead vocalist [[Sammy Hagar]]. With Hagar, the group released four U.S. number-one, multi-platinum albums over the course of 11 years: ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' in 1986, ''[[OU812]]'' in 1988, ''[[For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge]]'' in 1991, and ''[[Balance (Van Halen album)|Balance]]'' in 1995. The group released a double-platinum live album, ''[[Live: Right Here, Right Now]]'', in 1993. Hagar left the band in 1996 shortly before the release of the band's first greatest hits collection, ''[[Best Of – Volume I (Van Halen album)|Best Of – Volume I]]''. Former [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] frontman [[Gary Cherone]] replaced Hagar and recorded the commercially unsuccessful album ''[[Van Halen III]]'' with the band in 1998, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a [[Summer Tour 2004 (Van Halen)|worldwide tour in 2004]] and the double-disc greatest hits collection, ''[[The Best of Both Worlds (Van Halen album)|The Best of Both Worlds]]'' (2004). Hagar again left Van Halen after the tour in 2004. Roth returned in 2006, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, [[Wolfgang Van Halen]]. In 2012, the band released their final studio album, ''[[A Different Kind of Truth]]'', which was critically and commercially successful. It was also the band's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. Eddie was diagnosed with cancer in 2001, and died of the disease on October 6, 2020.<ref name=Wolf>{{cite tweet|user=WolfVanHalen|title=I can't believe I'm having to write this, but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning.

==History==
===1972–1977: Formation and early history===
The Van Halen brothers were born in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands, [[Alex Van Halen]] in 1953 and [[Eddie Van Halen]] in 1955,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ABCDDD:010830689|title=Familiebericht|newspaper=Het Parool |date=January 28, 1955|via=Koninklijke Bibliotheek}}</ref> sons to [[Dutch people|Dutch]] musician Jan Van Halen and Indonesian-born [[Indo people|Indo]] Eugenia Van Beers. The family moved to [[Pasadena, California]], in 1962. Eddie began learning classical piano [[Playing by ear|by ear]], and became so proficient he won an annual piano recital contest two or three years in a row, despite never mastering [[sight-reading]] [[sheet music]]. The brothers began playing music together in the 1960s, with Eddie on drums and Alex on guitar. However, while Ed was delivering newspapers to pay off his drum set, Alex secretly developed a passion and proficiency at them. Eventually, out of frustration and brotherly competition, Eddie told Alex, "OK, you play drums and I'll play your guitar."<ref name="ReferenceA">''Everybody Wants Some: The Van Halen Saga'' by Ian Christie, {{ISBN|978-0-470-03910-6}}</ref>

The Van Halen brothers formed their first band, the Broken Combs, in 1964. As they gained popularity playing backyard parties and local high school functions, they changed their name first to the Trojan Rubber Co, then in 1972 to Genesis, later to Mammoth when they discovered [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] was already in use by a major-label British band. At this time the band included Eddie on both vocals and lead guitar and friend Mark Stone on bass. They rented a [[public address system|sound-system]] from Indiana-born Pasadena transplant [[David Lee Roth]] for $10 per night. Roth fronted a local R&B influenced rock band the Red Ball Jets. Roth's uncle Manny owned [[Cafe Wha?]] in New York City until 1968. Partly to save money, they invited Roth to join as their lead vocalist despite previous unconvincing auditions.<ref name="guitarcom">{{cite web |url=http://www.vhlinks.com/pages/interviews/evh/gu072378.php|website=Vhlinks.com|title=Eddie van Halen |access-date=August 13, 2007}}</ref> Ultimately Roth's charismatic "[[Jim Dandy (song)|Jim Dandy]]" approach would be both an artistic foil to Eddie's circumspect, guitar prodigy talents as well as allowing Eddie to focus his energies on song composition.

[[File:Van halen at La Canada High School 1976.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Van Halen performing at [[La Cañada High School]] in 1975.]]
In 1973, Mammoth changed its name to Van Halen.<ref name="Van Halen"/> According to Roth,<ref>''Crazy from the Heat'' by David Lee Roth</ref> this was his idea. He felt it was a name that held long-term identity, artistic and marketing advantages, like [[Santana (band)|Santana]]. They continued to play Pasadena, San Bernardino, and Venice at clubs, festivals, backyard parties and city parks like Hamilton, drawing up to 2,000 people. Traffic jams and noise complaints to the local police often ensued, as far away as San Pedro.<ref>{{Cite news|date=December 18, 1974|title=Early Van Halen gig, at the Christmas Family Festival at the Greek Theatre.

This tenacious self-promotion soon built them an auspicious, loyal, area following.<ref name="guitarcom"/> 
[[File:Van halen flyer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Flyer handed out at [[La Cañada High School]] show. Eddie playing an [[Ibanez]] Destroyer.]]
By 1974, Roth had been in the band for about a year, and they decided to replace the ambivalent Stone, who was unsure about a career in music. [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony Sobolewski]], a Pasadena college music-classmate of Eddie's, joined the group after an all-night jam session. He had sung and played bass in a number of less successful Arcadia backyard-party bands, including Snake. Although he was hesitant, his bandmate in Snake encouraged him to seize this opportunity.<ref name=guitarcom /> Also in 1974, the band had a major break when it was hired to play regularly at the [[Sunset Strip]] club [[Gazzarri's]]. The Doors had "broken" there in the late 1960s. Owner Bill Gazzarri had previously claimed Van Halen was too loud for the venue. However, their new managers, Mark Algorri and Mario Miranda, took over the club's hiring and booked them through 1976.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} By the Spring of 1975, they were the regular Tuesday night band at Myron's Ballroom.<ref>{{Cite news|date=March 21, 1975|title=Van Halen.

All the club gig success led to the need for a demo tape, which was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Northridge where [[Steely Dan]] had recently completed an LP at the time. [[Rodney Bingenheimer]] saw Van Halen at Gazzarri's in the summer of 1976, and enticed [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] to see them. Impressed to action, Simmons produced a 29-track Van Halen demo tape, entitled "Zero" at [[The Village (studio)|Village Recorder]] studios in Los Angeles and with post-production overdubs completed at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whiskyagogo.com/articles/770104.html |title=Whiskey Articles |website=Whiskyagogo.com |access-date=March 12, 2011}}</ref> Simmons suggested changing their name to "Daddy Longlegs." However, a very disappointed Simmons could do no more once Kiss management opined that Van Halen "had no chance of making it".<ref>Van Halen: The Early Years movie</ref>

===1977–1985: Breakthrough and initial success with David Lee Roth===
Doug Messenger, Van Morrison's band leader guitarist, knowing that [[Ted Templeman]] was looking for a "guitar hero" act, had seen Van Halen at the [[Starwood (nightclub)|Starwood]] in Hollywood and placed a number of calls to [[Warner Records]] for Ted to check them out. "I don't know if it was 4 calls or 10, but I knew this was exactly the act Ted wanted. So on a horrendously rainy night in mid-1977", Warner Bros. executive [[Mo Ostin]] and producer Ted Templeman saw Van Halen perform at the Starwood in Hollywood.{{cn|date=April 2025}} It was Van Halen's first booking at the Starwood and the first time they hired their own roadies. "We wanted to come on with a little class and we couldn't be seen setting up our own stuff in Hollywood," explained Roth.<ref>{{Cite news|date=December 27, 1977|title=LA Times_December 27, 1977_Van Halen|pages=61|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20534174/la-timesdecember-27-1977van-halen/|access-date=May 7, 2020}}</ref> Although the audience was negligible – Messenger claims only a barmaid and himself were there until Ostin and Templeman arrived – the Warner Bros. reps were so impressed that they wrote a [[letter of intent]] on a napkin, and within a week met at a local diner with the band, their future manager Marshall Berle (nephew of comedian [[Milton Berle]]) and Warner touring manager Noel Monk, who had just guided the [[Sex Pistols]] across the United States. According to Noel Monk's book, the band's car had broken down en route to the meeting at the diner, and rather than leave the Warner Bros. reps waiting and appear to be an irresponsible band, the members of Van Halen actually ran the remaining distance of several miles to arrive only slightly late.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Monk |first=Noel |title=Runnin' with the Devil: A Backstage Pass to the Wild Times, Loud Rock, and the Down and Dirty Truth Behind the Making of Van Halen |date=2017 |publisher=Dey Street Books |isbn=978-0062474100 |publication-date=2017 |pages=28 |language=English}}</ref> Warner offered the band a two album recording contract, one that heavily favored Warner, paying the band $0.70 per unit (album) sold, a deal that would leave the band over $1&nbsp;million in debt at the conclusion of their first supporting tour as the opening act for [[Journey (band)|Journey]] and [[Ronnie Montrose]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jas |last=Obrecht |url=http://www.musiciansfriend.com/document?doc_id=81828&src=3SOSWXXA |title=A Legend is Born Eddie Van Halen's First Interview |publisher=Musician's Friend |access-date=November 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218222440/http://www.musiciansfriend.com/document?doc_id=81828&src=3SOSWXXA |archive-date=December 18, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The group recorded their debut album at [[Sunset Sound Recorders]] studio from mid-September to early October 1977, recording guitar parts for one week and then vocals for two additional. All of the tracks were laid down with little [[overdubbing]] or multi-tracking. Minor mistakes were purposely left on the record and a very rudimentary instrument set-up was used to give the record a live feel. During this time, they continued to play various venues in Southern California, including concerts at the Pasadena Convention Center produced by their promoter and impresario, Steve Tortomasi. {{cn|date=April 2025}}

''[[Van Halen (album)|Van Halen]]'' reached No. 19 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] pop music charts, one of rock's most commercially successful debuts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webalmanac.allinfoabout.com/music/1970.html |title=1970s: 100 Best-Selling Albums |publisher=All Info About Web Almanac |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105211239/http://webalmanac.allinfoabout.com/music/1970.html |archive-date=January 5, 2007}}</ref> It was regarded as both a heavy metal and hard rock album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/rs500/listing9.lasso|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531104356/http://www.rhino.com/rs500/listing9.lasso |url-status=dead|archive-date=May 31, 2009|title=Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums Ever Listing 401–450|date=May 31, 2009}}</ref> The album included songs now regarded as Van Halen classics, like "[[Runnin' with the Devil]]" and the guitar solo "[[Eruption (instrumental)|Eruption]]", which showcased Eddie's use of a technique known as [[Tapping|"finger-tapping"]], leading into what became the band's first single, a cover of "[[You Really Got Me]]". The band toured for 9 months more, opening for [[Black Sabbath]] and establishing a reputation for their performances.<ref name="Monk, Noel memoir">Monk, Noel memoir</ref> The band's chemistry was based on Eddie Van Halen's guitar technique and David Lee Roth's charisma. The band returned to the studio for two weeks in late 1978, to record ''[[Van Halen II]]'', a 1979 [[LP record|LP]] similar in style to their debut. This record yielded the band's first hit single, "[[Dance the Night Away (Van Halen song)|Dance the Night Away]]", which peaked at 15 on BB Hot 100.

Over the next four years, the band toured non-stop, never taking more than two weeks to record an album. Their album ''[[Women and Children First]]'' was released in 1980, and further cemented Van Halen's platinum-selling status to Warner Bros. It yielded two hit singles, "[[And the Cradle Will Rock...]]" and "[[Everybody Wants Some!! (song)|Everybody Wants Some!!]]". For the first time, an amplified [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] was used to complement Eddie's guitar.

In 1981, during the recording of ''[[Fair Warning (Van Halen album)|Fair Warning]]'', Eddie's desire for darker, more complex songs in minor keys was at odds with Roth's pop tastes and style. Nonetheless, Roth and veteran Warner Bros. rock producer Ted Templeman acquiesced to Eddie's wishes on this album. Doug Messenger recalled how Ed and engineer Don Landee rerecorded the "[[Unchained (song)|Unchained]]" solo hours after Ted "stormed out of" the studio. This darker album only reached platinum status after $250,000 of [[payola]] pushed it up nationwide from 400,000 copies.<ref name="Monk, Noel memoir"/>

Planning to release a cover single, then take a  hiatus, Roth and Eddie agreed upon a remake of the 1960s [[Roy Orbison]] song "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]", which peaked at 12 on BB Top 100. "Oh, Pretty Woman"'s comical video helped its success, but was also banned by MTV. Due to much pressure from Warner Bros., the hiatus was canceled and the ''[[Diver Down]]'' LP was squeezed out, again, within two weeks time.<ref name="Monk, Noel memoir"/> Roth's preference for pop covers prevailed this time and with Eddie's synthesizer and guitar riffs ''Diver Down'' charted much better. The band earned a spot in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the highest-paid single appearance of a band: $1.5&nbsp;million for a 90-minute set at [[Steve Wozniak]]'s 1983 [[US Festival]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gill |first1=Chris |title=Eddie Van Halen Revisits Van Halen's Landmark '1984' Album |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/eddie-van-halen-looks-back-van-halen-1984-album-5150-studios |website=Guitar World |access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref> a show that both Noel Monk and Doug Messenger considered artistically a disaster, Roth having consumed alcohol to the point of forgetting lyrics.<ref name="Monk, Noel memoir"/> Despite this return to form, Roth and Eddie's differences continued, and this caused friction with other band members. [[Billy Sheehan]], after his band [[Talas (band)|Talas]] completed a tour with Van Halen, claims he was approached by Eddie to replace Michael Anthony; the reasons for this were never completely clear to Sheehan, as nothing came of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025221139/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/Interviews05/billysheehan05.htm|url-status=dead|title=Classic Rock Revisited your online source for Rock and Metal fans|archive-date=October 25, 2007|website=Classicrockrevisited.com}}</ref> During this time, Eddie contributed the score and instrumental songs to the film ''[[The Wild Life (film)|The Wild Life]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Eddie Van Halen – "Good Enough" from 'The Wild Life' Movie Score | date=September 17, 2013 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dw6YrpsPWs| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211028/8Dw6YrpsPWs| archive-date=October 28, 2021|language=en|access-date=May 7, 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The score was laden with drum machine and hinted at sounds and riffs that would come with their next two albums, [[1984 (Van Halen album)|''1984'']] and [[5150 (album)|''5150'']].

Other singles included "[[Panama (song)|Panama]]" (No. 13 U.S.), "[[I'll Wait]]" (also No. 13 U.S.), and "[[Hot for Teacher]]". Three of the songs had popular music videos on MTV. ''1984'' was praised by critics<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r20987|access-date=August 17, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=van%2Bhalen |title=Van Halen |access-date=August 17, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanhalen/albums/album/236834/review/6067491/1984 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202061419/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanhalen/albums/album/236834/review/6067491/1984 |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 2, 2007 |title=Van Halen: 1984 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 17, 2007}}</ref> and peaked at No. 2 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts behind [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' (which notably had a guitar solo by Eddie on "[[Beat It]]").

Following the 1984 Tour, Roth decided to quit and form a new band. Group members have given different reasons for the split, but all were firmly rooted in control of the band's sound, artistic direction, singles released and pace. Roth was concerned about Eddie playing music outside of Van Halen. Roth was also launching a successful solo career with two hit cover songs off his ''[[Crazy from the Heat]]'' EP, a remake of [[the Beach Boys]]' classic "[[California Girls]]" (No. 3 U.S.) and a pairing of the classic [[Al Jolson]] standard "[[Just a Gigolo (song)|Just a Gigolo]]" and "[[I Ain't Got Nobody]]" (No. 12 U.S.), which had previously been paired together by [[Louis Prima]]. Roth was offered a $20-million film deal for a script titled ''Crazy from the Heat''. Roth hoped Van Halen would contribute the soundtrack; however, the film deal fell through when [[TriStar Television|CBS Pictures]] was reorganized in 1986.{{citation needed|date=April 2025}}

===1985–1996: Sammy Hagar era===
[[File:Sammy Hagar.jpg|alt=Hagar playing guitar|thumb|The introduction of Sammy Hagar (pictured in 2005) as vocalist continued the band's worldwide popularity.]]
Eddie invited [[Patty Smyth]] of [[Scandal (American band)|Scandal]] to replace Roth, but she declined.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hillis |first1=Roger |title=Patty Smyth and Scandal returning to Dewey Beach |url=https://www.delawareonline.com/story/entertainment/music/2014/02/13/patty-smyth-and-scandal-returning-to-dewey-beach/5444265/ |website=[[Delaware Online]] |access-date=August 18, 2019}}</ref> [[Daryl Hall]] was offered the lead vocal position in 1985, but also declined.

Eddie was introduced to [[Sammy Hagar]] in 1985, via their mutual car mechanic. Hagar was the former frontman for the hard rock group [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]], and a solo artist coming off a very successful year. His hit single "[[I Can't Drive 55]]" came from his 1984 album [[VOA (Sammy Hagar album)|''VOA'']], produced by [[Ted Templeman]], who had produced Montrose's first album [[Montrose (album)|''Montrose'']], as well as all of Van Halen's albums up to that point. Hagar agreed to sing as well as play rhythm guitar.

When Warner Bros. president Mo Ostin came to the band's [[5150 Studios]] to hear the band's progress, Hagar said the band played "[[Why Can't This Be Love]]" live with Eddie on keyboards, after which Ostin proclaimed: "I smell money."<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Greene |first1=Andy |title=Van Halen's '5150': Sammy Hagar Looks Back |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/van-halens-5150-sammy-hagar-looks-back-97736/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=April 17, 2019 |date=March 24, 2016}}</ref>

The 1986 Van Halen album ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' was a huge hit, becoming the band's first No. 1 album on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts, driven by the keyboard-dominated singles "Why Can't This Be Love" (No. 3 U.S.), "[[Dreams (Van Halen song)|Dreams]]", and "[[Love Walks In]]" (Top 30 U.S.). To further introduce the new era for the band, a new Van Halen logo was put on the cover. It retained elements of the original, but with lines extending from either side of 'VH' wrapped around and formed a ring.

Following the release of the ''5150'' album, the [[5150 Tour]] was launched to support it across North America. Footage was released on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] as ''[[Live Without a Net (Van Halen video)|Live Without a Net]]''. The band minimized the use of pre-Hagar Van Halen songs in the set.<ref>{{cite web |title=Van Halen: Sammy Hagar reflects on 5150 album anniversary |url=http://www.hennemusic.com/2019/03/van-halen-sammy-hagar-reflects-on-5150.html |website=Hennemusic.com |access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref>

All four studio albums produced during this period reached No. 1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] pop music charts and 17 singles breached the top 12 of the mainstream rock tracks chart. During that era, a single taken from 1988's ''[[OU812]]'', "[[When It's Love]]", reached the Top Five, peaking at No. 5. In addition, Van Halen was nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s. The band won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal for the album ''[[For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-02-26-ca-2742-story.html|title=34th Annual Grammy Award Winners|date=February 26, 1992|via=LA Times}}</ref> Van Halen continued to enjoy success throughout the mid-1990s. They recorded a live album and concert film at two 1992 F.U.C.K. tour shows in Fresno, California called ''[[Live: Right Here, Right Now]].'' During the F.U.C.K. and the live album supporting Live: Right Here Right Now tour, [[Night Ranger]]'s [[Alan Fitzgerald]] played keyboards offstage every night allowing Eddie to concentrate on guitar. Fitzgerald returned to play-offstage keyboards on the 2004, 2007, and 2012 tours.

In 1995, Van Halen released the album ''[[Balance (Van Halen album)|Balance]]'' and supported [[Bon Jovi]] on their [[These Days Tour|European Summer stadium tour]]. The [[Balance Tour]] was nicknamed the "Ambulance Tour" by the band due to an amount of physical ailments, as Hagar had throat problems during the first concerts, Eddie suffered a hip injury caused by [[avascular necrosis]], and Alex wore a [[neck brace]] due to ruptured vertebrae.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wilkening |first1=Matthew |title=25 Years Ago: Van Halen Chronicle Balance Tour With Pay-Per-View |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/van-halen-1995-toronto-pay-per-view/ |access-date=April 18, 2022 |work=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=August 22, 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|isbn=9781493062102|page=162|publisher=Backbeat|author=Christopher, Michael|title=Van Halen: The Eruption and the Aftershock|date=October 6, 2021 }}</ref>

The band was working on a compilation album. This led to conflicts with Hagar and the group's new manager, [[Ray Danniels]] (Ed Leffler's replacement and Alex Van Halen's former brother-in-law), even though it was Leffler who had renewed their contract with Warner Bros. Records and had added of a greatest hits album option years before. Hagar was reluctant to work on a compilation album before a new album came out, but if the rest of the band and Danniels insisted on going forward with one at that time, his preference was that it should include only Roth-era songs, or as a third choice, that two volumes should be released, one of Roth-era songs and one of Hagar-era songs. During this same period, competing personal priorities and creative differences contributed to increasing interpersonal tensions within the band, particularly between Eddie and Hagar. The relationship between Hagar and Van Halen broke down.<ref name="GWHuff"/>

===1996: Temporary reunion with Roth===
Roth called Eddie to discuss what tracks would be included on a planned Van Halen compilation (work on which had actually begun before Hagar's departure). They got along well, and Eddie invited him up to his house/studio. Shortly afterwards, Roth re-entered the studio with the band and producer [[Glen Ballard]]. Two songs from those sessions were added to the band's ''[[Best Of – Volume I (Van Halen album)|Best Of – Volume I]]'' album and released as singles to promote it.

In September, Van Halen was asked to present an award at the [[1996 MTV Video Music Awards]]. They agreed, and on September 4, 1996, the four original members of Van Halen made their first public appearance together in over eleven years. This helped to bring the compilation to No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. However, unknown to Roth, Eddie and Alex were still auditioning other singers, including [[Mitch Malloy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/mitchmalloy.html|title=Mitch Malloy – Talks Van Halen|website=Melodicrock.com|access-date=September 2, 2007|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072019/http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/mitchmalloy.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vhnd.com/2012/10/18/audio-mitch-malloys-audition-for-van-halen-1996/|title=Audio: Mitch Malloy's Audition for Van Halen (1996)|date=October 18, 2012|website=Vhnd.com}}</ref>

The band's appearance on the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards fueled reunion speculation. But several weeks after the awards show, it was discovered that Roth was out of Van Halen again. Roth released a statement that Van Halen misled him into thinking they were seriously considering bringing him back into the band and that he had made clear to them beforehand that he did not want to do the awards show unless they were actually reuniting.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Open Letter from David Lee Roth |url=https://mflwp.tripod.com/letter.htm |website=My Filthy Little Web Page |access-date=August 31, 2023 |date=October 2, 1996}}</ref> The next day, the Van Halen brothers and Anthony released their own statement, denying they had in any way led Roth to believe they were planning to bring him back into the band.<ref>{{cite web |title=David Lee Roth Not Rejoining Van Halen |url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/oct/05/david-lee-roth-not-rejoining-van-halen/ |website=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |access-date=August 31, 2023 |date=October 5, 1996}}</ref>

Eddie later recounted that at the MTV Video Music Awards appearance, he was embarrassed and outraged by Roth's antics while on camera behind [[Beck]], who was giving an acceptance speech for the award that Van Halen had presented to him. At a backstage press conference, press queries about a reunion tour were met with Eddie saying that he needed a hip replacement and would have to record an entire new studio album before any tour. Roth told Eddie to avoid talking about negative things like his hip and the two almost came to blows.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Greene |first=Andy |title=Flashback: Watch Van Halen Meltdown Onstage at 1996 VMAs |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/flashback-van-halen-meltdown-onstage-at-1996-vmas-124336/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 30, 2023 |date=October 4, 2016}}</ref>

===1996–2000: Gary Cherone era===
[[File:Gary Cherone-Extreme-2.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright=0.7|Vocalist Gary Cherone (pictured in 2008) joined the band briefly in the late 1990s.]]
Van Halen's next lead singer was [[Gary Cherone]], former frontman of the Boston-based band [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], a group which had enjoyed some popular success in the early 1990s.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-25-boldest-career-moves-in-rock-history-150807/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017171646/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-25-boldest-career-moves-in-rock-history-20110318/van-halen-hire-gary-cherone-19691231|url-status=dead|title=25 Boldest Career Moves in Music|first1=Andy|last1=Greene|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 18, 2011|archive-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref> The result was the album ''[[Van Halen III]]''. Many songs were longer and more experimental than Van Halen's earlier work. It was a notable contrast from their previous material, with more focus on ballads than traditional rock songs ("How Many Say I", with Eddie on vocals). Sales were poor by the band's standards, only reaching a Gold certification, despite the album peaking at No. 4 on the U.S. charts. However, ''Van Halen III'' did produce the hit "[[Without You (Van Halen song)|Without You]]", and another album track, "Fire in the Hole", appeared on the ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'' soundtrack. The album was followed by a tour. The ''III'' Tour saw Van Halen playing in countries they did not visit before, including first visits to Australia and New Zealand. "Without You" acquired No. 1 place on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Charts in 1998, the 13th song of theirs to do so. This made them the band with the most Mainstream Rock No. 1s.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/pro/three-days-grace-most-mainstream-rock-number-ones-van-halen/|title=Three Days Grace Ties Van Halen for Most No. 1s on Mainstream Rock Songs Chart|magazine=Billboard|access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref>

Van Halen returned to the studio and in early 1999 started work on a new album. For the sessions, they brought on [[Danny Kortchmar]] to produce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/van-halen-second-gary-cherone-record/|title=How Far Did Van Halen Get Into Their Second Gary Cherone Record?|website=Ultimateclassicrock.com|date=November 5, 2019 |access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1435099/van-halen-taps-kortchmar-to-produce-next-lp/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106154651/http://www.mtv.com/news/1435099/van-halen-taps-kortchmar-to-produce-next-lp/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2019|title=Van Halen Taps Kortchmar To Produce Next LP|website=Mtv.coms|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref> Working titles of songs included "Left for Dead", "River Wide", "Say Uncle", "You Wear it Well", "More Than Yesterday", "I Don't Miss You&nbsp;...

Cherone stated that he believed if he and the band had toured first and then recorded an album they might have creatively gelled more and the album would have turned out better.{{citation needed|date=April 2025}}

Touring with Cherone had proven disappointing in terms of attendance. Eddie later admitted that Warner Bros. had forced his hand in parting with Cherone.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}} Unlike with the previous two singers, there was reportedly no bad blood behind the breakup, and Cherone remained in contact and on good terms with Van Halen.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}} As when Hagar left, speculation resumed on a Roth reunion.

===1999–2003: Hiatus from public===
Eddie recovered from his hip surgery in November 1999, but from 2000 to early 2004 no statements were made by Van Halen and no music was released. However, information about members past and present trickled in. The Van Halen brothers continued writing at 5150 Studios, Cherone recorded an album and toured with new band [[Tribe of Judah (band)|Tribe of Judah]]. One of the songs that Cherone had written for the scrapped second album with Van Halen, titled "Left For Dead", had its lyrics set to a new musical arrangement with Tribe of Judah.{{cn|date=April 2025}}

[[File:Sammy Hagar and the Waboritas.jpg|alt=The band hugging onstage|thumb|left|After leaving Van Halen, Hagar has focused on his band the Waboritas as well as branching out into the [[Cabo Wabo]] nightclub, merchandise, and alcohol brands.]]
Responding to speculation that he had been approached to replace Cherone, [[David Coverdale]] said, "I called a mutual friend and said, 'Tell Eddie I had nothing to do with this.' It just got ridiculous. I've heard that they were going to approach me, but since I left [[Deep Purple|Purple]] I've always done my own thing. Why would I join anybody else?"<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The big picture: The hands fell off the clock!|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] No. 28|date=June 2001|page=6}}</ref>

In 2000, the band reunited briefly with David Lee Roth attempting to do a new album, only for disputes with Roth to abort these plans. The recorded demos were among the ones reworked into new songs on 2012's ''[[A Different Kind of Truth]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/van-halen-2000-roth-album/|title = Did van Halen Almost Finish a David Lee Roth Reunion LP in 2000?|website=Ultimate classicrock.com| date=July 21, 2021 }}</ref> The band also tried to just schedule some concerts with Roth at a later date.<ref name=ant>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vhnd.com/2006/03/17/michael-anthony-breaks-his-silence/|title=Michael Anthony Breaks His Silence|date=March 17, 2006|website=Vhnd.com}}</ref> In 2001, the band had entered early discussions with [[Ozzy Osbourne]] to serve as the next lead vocalist of the band. Negotiations ended, due to the production schedule of ''[[The Osbournes]]'' however.<ref name="2025_RS" />

In the summer of 2002, Roth and Hagar teamed up in the ''Song for Song, the Heavyweight Champs of Rock and Roll'' tour (also known as the 'Sans-Halen' or 'Sam & Dave' Tour). The tour, with both singers headlining, attracted media and audience fascination because it seemed more improbable than ever a Van Halen tour with Roth or Hagar. It drew large crowds and featured no opening acts, Roth and Hagar alternating as the first act. Roth contrasted his personality with Hagar's: "He's the kind of guy you go out with to split a bottle with a friend. I'm the kind of guy you go out with if you want to split your friend with a bottle."{{cn|date=April 2025}} Anthony guested with Hagar's band, [[the Waboritas]], numerous times and sometimes sang lead vocals. During performances, Hagar would tease Anthony by asking, "Do the brothers know you're here?" Anthony never played with Roth. Cherone appeared on occasion. Hagar released a live album (''Hallelujah''), featuring vocals by Anthony and Cherone, and a documentary DVD, ''Long Road to Cabo'', about touring with Roth. While the two singers promoted the tour and publicly claimed mutual respect, rumors of bitter acrimony and mutual loathing swirled. The allegations were later supported by backstage video, which showed the Roth and Hagar camps maintaining strict separation.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

Next, Hagar joined with [[Joe Satriani]] and [[Journey (band)|Journey]] guitarist Neal Schon to form a side project, Planet Us, with Michael Anthony and Deen Castronovo (also of Journey) on drums. The band recorded just two songs and played live a few times before dissolving when Hagar and Anthony rejoined Van Halen.{{citation needed|date=April 2025}}

On July 4, 2004, Roth performed with the [[Boston Pops]], at United States' annual ''Pops Goes the Fourth'' celebration in Boston. Hagar remained active, releasing five albums and creating his own merchandising brand Cabo Wabo, which lends its name to the line of [[tequila]] he formerly owned,  as well as his franchise of cantinas. He reunited with [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]] in 2003 and 2005 for a few performances and maintained contact with Anthony, often playing with him. With Van Halen inactive, Anthony set up a website and worked on merchandising projects such as his signature [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] bass and range of hot sauces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madanthonycafe.com/ |title=Mad Anthony's Cafe |publisher=madanthonycafe.com |access-date=March 12, 2011}}</ref> He became involved with the annual music industry [[NAMM Show]].

===2003–2005: Reunion with Hagar===
[[Image:VanHalenwithHagar.jpg|thumb|right|Van Halen during their 2004 reunion period. Left to right: Michael Anthony, Sammy Hagar, Eddie Van Halen.]]
Anthony had repeatedly contacted Hagar regarding a reunion, detailing how the attempts to do the same with Roth never worked out. Eventually, Hagar decided to call Alex to spend a day together with him. The two got along and became interested in reuniting on stage.<ref name=ant/> Van Halen and Hagar reunited for a new compilation release and a summer concert tour of the U.S.{{cn|date=April 2025}}

In July 2004, Van Halen released ''[[The Best of Both Worlds (Van Halen album)|The Best of Both Worlds]]'', a double CD compilation featuring three new songs with Hagar: "It's About Time", "Up for Breakfast", and "Learning to See". These new songs were credited to Hagar/Van Halen/Van Halen, which was unusual since normally the entire lineup, which also included Michael Anthony, would be credited. However, the performance was credited to the entire band. Anthony revealed in interviews that Eddie had in fact not wanted him to be a part of the reunion, with him only joining at Hagar's insistence. The new songs had already been recorded, with Eddie playing the bass parts himself instead, and Anthony only provided backing vocals for the three tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/michael-anthony-speaks-candidly-about-van-halen-s-past-and-future/ |title=MICHAEL ANTHONY Speaks Candidly About VAN HALEN's Past And Future |last=Harrell |first=John "Shooter" |publisher=blabbermouth.net |date=March 17, 2006 |access-date=December 17, 2013}}</ref> No songs with Cherone from ''Van Halen III'' were included. It was certified platinum in the US in August 2004.

[[Van Halen Summer Tour 2004|The Summer 2004 tour]] grossed almost US$55&nbsp;million, and Pollstar listed Van Halen in the top 10 grossing tours of 2004.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} Critical reviews of the tour were mixed.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} On some shows, Eddie's son Wolfgang came onstage and played guitar with his father during "316", a song dedicated to his son, taking its name from his March 16 date of birth. During the later stages of the tour, stories of Eddie being drunk began to surface along with fan-shot video footage of poor playing.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} At the band's final show of the tour, in Tucson, Eddie smashed one of his guitars at the end of the show.{{cn|date=April 2025}}

After the tour, things broke down. At first Hagar stated he had yet to decide what he would be doing with Van Halen, although he was still an official member of the band. Soon after, however, both Hagar and Anthony admitted that Eddie had problems with alcohol during the tour that affected everyone involved. Hagar stated that he was "done with Van Halen" and wished that everyone would have "taken it more seriously."{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} Despite this, Eddie later described himself as "satisfied" with the tour.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

After the tour ended, Hagar returned to his solo band [[the Waboritas]], and Anthony appeared with him on tour occasionally. The band quickly faded from view after Hagar left again.{{cn|date=April 2025}}

[[File:VAN HALEN KSAT 20080124 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Roth and the Van Halen brothers performing in San Antonio, Texas in 2008.]]
Rumors of a Roth reunion re-emerged and on January 3, 2006, Roth explained during an interview that he had spoken to Alex Van Halen the previous week and a reunion was "inevitable."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/search/s_409665.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214192404/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/search/s_409665.html |url-status=dead|archive-date=February 14, 2006|title=David Lee Roth makes radio debut - PittsburghLIVE.com|date=February 14, 2006}}</ref> However, he also said that Eddie Van Halen was "off in his own little world". When asked if any problems occurred with Hagar during the 2004 tour Eddie answered, "Sammy is Sammy, and for the most part that's just fine." Roth persisted with suggestions of a reunion,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/02-15-2006/entertainment/story/391333p-331935c.html |title=New York Daily News article |date=October 1, 2010}} {{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=Jennica |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> saying, "People want the reunion," and "No one will pay respect to what any of us do [musically] until we get the reunion out of the way." In May 2006, he told Billboard.com, "There's contact between the two camps."{{cn|date=April 2025}}

On June 3, Anthony began a successful tour with Hagar billed as the Other Half (a reference to them being half of Van Halen with the other half being Eddie/Alex), with Anthony singing lead vocals sometimes. Meanwhile, on June 19 the Van Halen brothers jumped onstage with [[Kenny Chesney]] at [[The Home Depot Center]] performing "Jump" and "[[You Really Got Me]]". This unusual performance was their first onstage since the 2004 tour. This was followed by another Eddie performance on July 19, 2006, at the House of Petals in Los Angeles, playing new material. He followed this with an announcement on July 27, 2006, that some of his new music would be released on the soundtrack for the pornographic film ''Sacred Sin''.{{cn|date=April 2025}}

After nearly 10 months of speculation and rumors, Van Halen (and Roth separately via his own website<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidleeroth.com/ |title=announced on August&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2007,&nbsp;September&nbsp;27.|publisher=Davidleeroth.com |access-date=August 14, 2007}}</ref>) said that the band would be going on a tour of North America. Roth claimed in the press release that, "the idea is that this will continue on and on and on" and also that [[Van Halen World Tour 2008|a world tour]] and a new album were both in the works.

Despite an average ticket price of approximately $150, Van Halen's "[[A Different Kind of Truth Tour]]" proved to be a commercial success as well, with nearly all U.S. arena shows "either sold-out, or close to it."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spinner.com/2012/05/18/van-halen-cancel-summer-tour-dates/ |title=Van Halen Cancel Summer Tour Dates |publisher=Spinner |date=May 18, 2012 |access-date=September 3, 2012 |archive-date=April 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430165612/http://www.spinner.com/2012/05/18/van-halen-cancel-summer-tour-dates/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Critically, the band received mostly positive reviews, particularly when performing throughout the U.S. Northeast and West Coast.

He stated: "There are so many different variables in a band like ours. We don't just walk in the studio and plan, 'Let's make a record,' although we have done that to some degree. But it's not a mechanical process for us. We go in and we play and see what happens, listen to it, invite a couple of people and then see what happens with that. ...But now that Ed's gone, none of those things are really valid because all I have, and Wolf has, is all the recordings in the vault. And they will stay there until we figure out how and why and what to do with them. And again, you have to remember, it has to be on the level of where Ed and I, where we used to play." The musician explained that there is enough material for three to four complete albums.<ref name="2025_BM">{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/alex-van-halen-says-there-is-probably-three-or-four-records-worth-of-unreleased-eddie-van-halen-music\work=Blabbermouth|title=ALEX VAN HALEN Says There Is 'Probably Three Or Four' Records' Worth Of Unreleased EDDIE VAN HALEN Music|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=November 16, 2024|access-date=January 9, 2025}}</ref>

Alex detailed that in addition to the need for collaboration with other musicians to complete these variety of songs, he has looked into the potential use of [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] to duplicate the style of guitar work by his brother, Eddie Van Halen. Additionally, he expressed interest in hiring [[Robert Plant]] as the vocalist for the future albums.<ref name="2025_RS" /> He additionally announced plans to develop a biopic about the band's formation.<ref name="2025_RS" />

==Contract riders==
[[File:Van Halen 027.jpg|alt=A laser show above the band|thumb|Van Halen's elaborate stage productions required extra security included in their contract riders]]
The complex technical demands of a Van Halen tour ultimately had a notable side-effect on modern pop music tours, especially via the concert's technical [[Rider (theater)|contract rider]]. The band used contract riders to verify the venue's power availability, security, structural and weight distribution details. [[Van Halen Test|Their riders]] specified that a bowl of [[M&M's]] candies was to be placed in their dressing room and, separately, in a different area of the contract, that all of the brown M&M's were to be removed.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |date=January 19, 2001 |title=Did Van Halen's Concert Contract Require the Removal of Brown M&Ms? |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/ |access-date=December 8, 2009 |website=[[Snopes]]}}</ref> According to both manager Noel Monk and Roth, this was listed in the technical portion of the contract not because the band wanted to make capricious demands of the venue location, but rather as a test to see if the electrical, structural, security, and safety requirements in the rider had been thoroughly observed.<ref>From ''Crazy from the Heat'', David Lee Roth's autobiography</ref>

If the bowl, without brown M&Ms was present, then the band, management and crew could safely assume the other, more legitimate concerns in the technical rider were fulfilled; conversely, if the bowl was missing, or brown M&M's were present, then Van Halen management would be within their rights to have their crew or the venue inspect the work, redo it or even cancel the night's production at the venue's expense.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Zeveloff |first1=Julie |title=There's a brilliant reason why Van Halen asked for a bowl of M&Ms with all the brown candies removed before every show |url=https://www.insider.com/van-halen-brown-m-ms-contract-2016-9 |website=Insider |access-date=April 7, 2021 |date=September 6, 2016}}</ref> In one notable incident, officials at what is now [[Colorado State University Pueblo]] refused to honor the request, leading the band to go on a rampage that involved throwing food all over a dining area as well as "unmentionable" acts in a nearby restroom. However, even more damage was caused to the basketball floor in the [[Massari Arena|gymnasium]] due to the weight of the stage brought in.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matthew |first1=Amy |title=3/30/1980 - Pueblo, CO (Brown M&M incident) |url=https://www.themightyvanhalen.net/1980/03/30/1980-pueblo-co/ |website=The Mighty Van Halen |access-date=November 23, 2024 |date=March 28, 2010}}</ref>
