'''Paul McCartney and Wings''', often billed simply as '''Wings''', were a British-American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1971 in [[London]] by [[Paul McCartney]], formerly of [[the Beatles]], on vocals and bass, his wife [[Linda McCartney]] on keyboards, [[Denny Laine]], formerly of [[the Moody Blues]], on guitar and vocals, and [[Denny Seiwell]] on drums. They were noted for their commercial successes, musical eclecticism, and frequent personnel changes. They went through three lead guitarists and four drummers. The core trio of the McCartneys and Laine, however, remained intact throughout the group's existence.

Created following the McCartneys' 1971 album ''[[Ram (album)|Ram]]'', the band's first two albums, ''[[Wild Life (Wings album)|Wild Life]]'' (1971) and ''[[Red Rose Speedway]]'' (1973), the latter featuring guitarist [[Henry McCullough]], were viewed as artistic disappointments beside Paul's work with the Beatles. After the release of [[Live and Let Die (song)|the title track]] of the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', McCullough and Seiwell resigned from the band. The McCartneys and Laine then released 1973's ''[[Band on the Run]]'', a commercial and critical success that spawned two top-ten singles in "[[Jet (song)|Jet]]" and [[Band on the Run (song)|the title track]]. Following that album, the band recruited guitarist [[Jimmy McCulloch]] and drummer [[Geoff Britton]], only for Britton to quit shortly afterward and be replaced by [[Joe English (musician)|Joe English]]. With the new line-up, Wings released 1975's ''[[Venus and Mars (Wings album)|Venus and Mars]]'', which included the US number one single "[[Listen to What the Man Said]]", and undertook [[Wings Over the World tour|a highly successful world tour over 1975–76]]. Intended as more of a group effort, ''[[Wings at the Speed of Sound]]'' (1976) was issued midway through the tour and featured the hit singles "[[Silly Love Songs]]" and "[[Let 'Em In]]".

In 1977,  Wings experienced another line-up shuffle, with both McCulloch and English departing before the release of the group's only UK number one single, "[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]", which became one of the best-selling singles in history. Following the 1978 album ''[[London Town (Wings album)|London Town]]'', the McCartneys and Laine again added new members, guitarist [[Laurence Juber]] and drummer [[Steve Holley]]. The resulting album, ''[[Back to the Egg]]'', was a relative flop, with its singles under-performing and the critical reception negative. During [[Wings UK Tour 1979|the supporting tour]], Paul was arrested in Japan for cannabis possession, putting the band on hold. Despite a final US number one with a live-recorded version of "[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]" (1980), Wings discontinued in 1981 after Laine departed from the band. In total, the band had six number-one singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

== History ==
=== Origins ===
After [[break-up of the Beatles|the Beatles' break-up]] in 1970, McCartney recorded two solo albums: ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]'' (1970), credited to himself, and ''[[Ram (album)|Ram]]'' (1971), with his wife, Linda McCartney. He had insisted from the beginning of their marriage that Linda should be involved in his musical projects, notwithstanding her lack of previous experience as a musician, so that they did not have to be apart when he was on tour.<ref name="Lewisohn">{{cite book | author-link=Mark Lewisohn | last=Lewisohn |first=Mark | title=Wingspan| publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] (New York)| year=2002 | isbn=0-316-86032-8}}</ref> ''Ram'' was recorded in [[New York City]], where McCartney auditioned a number of drummers and guitarists, selecting Seiwell and guitarist [[David Spinozza]].<ref name=Diary>{{cite book|editor1=Miles, Barry |editor2=Badman, Keith |title=The Beatles Diary After the Break-Up: 1970–2001 |year=2001 |publisher=Music Sales Group |location=London |isbn=978-0-7119-8307-6 |edition=reprint}}</ref> When Spinozza became unavailable because of other session commitments, [[Hugh McCracken]] was enlisted to take his place.<ref name=AGP147>{{cite book|last=Perone|first=James E.|title=The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37907-9|page=147}}</ref>

=== 1971–1974: Formation and ''Wild Life'' to ''Band on the Run'' ===
After the release of ''Ram'', McCartney decided to form a new group and asked Seiwell and McCracken to join. Seiwell accepted, but McCracken declined, so McCartney invited [[Denny Laine]], whom he had known since the early 1960s, to join.<ref>Sounes, Howard. ''Fab: An Intimate Life of Paul McCartney'' (2010): 285–87</ref> Laine, who was working on a solo album at the time, got a phone call from McCartney enquiring if he would like to work with him, as McCartney said: "I'd known him in the past and I just rang him and asked him, 'What are you doing?' He said, 'Nothing', so I said, 'Right. Come on then!'"<ref name=Diary/> Laine then dropped plans for his album there and then.<ref name=Diary/> As he had in the Beatles, McCartney would serve as the chief bassist and lead singer for Wings and he doubled on guitar, keyboards, drums and assorted instruments at various times. When asked why he stayed on bass guitar rather than change back to guitar after the Beatles disbanded, he has explained that by then, he was "a bass player pretty much, who also happened to play guitar" and also considers himself a bassist who happens to play piano.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paulmccartney.com/news-blogs/news/you-gave-me-the-answer-wild-life-special|title=You Gave Me The Answer' - 'Wild Life' Special|date=26 October 2018|website=PaulMcCartney.com|access-date=5 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510025002/https://www.paulmccartney.com/news-blogs/news/you-gave-me-the-answer-wild-life-special|archive-date=10 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In August 1971, Seiwell and Laine joined Paul and Linda McCartney to record Paul's third post-Beatles album for [[Apple Records]]. The result was ''[[Wild Life (Wings album)|Wild Life]]'', released 7 December. It was the first project to credit Wings as the artist. The band name is said to have come to McCartney as he was praying in the hospital while Linda was giving birth to their second child together, [[Stella McCartney|Stella]], on 13 September 1971.<ref name="Lewisohn"/><ref name=Diary/> Paul McCartney recalled in the film ''[[Wingspan (film)|Wingspan]]'' that the birth of Stella was "a bit of a drama"; there were complications at the birth and that both Linda and the baby almost died. He was praying fervently and the image of wings came to his mind. He decided to name his new band "Wings".<ref name="Lewisohn"/>

In an attempt to capture the spontaneity of live performances, five of ''Wild Life''{{'s}} eight songs were first takes by the band.<ref name="Wright">Wright, Jeb.

[[File:Paul and Linda McCartney.jpg|thumb|right|Paul and Linda McCartney at the Academy Awards at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 2 April 1974]]
Near the end of the ''Red Rose Speedway'' sessions, in October 1972, Wings recorded the [[Live and Let Die (song)|theme song]] to the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', which reunited McCartney with [[The Beatles|Beatles]] producer/arranger [[George Martin]]. Issued as a non-album single in mid-1973, "Live and Let Die" became a worldwide hit and has remained a highlight of McCartney's post-Wings concert performances (often accompanied by [[pyrotechnics]]). That same year, McCartney and Wings filmed a TV special, the critically maligned ''[[James Paul McCartney (TV special)|James Paul McCartney]]'', which featured footage of the group performing in outdoor settings and in front of a studio audience.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Madinger|first1=Chip|last2=Easter|first2=Mark|title=Eight Arms to Hold You: The Solo Beatles Compendium|publisher=44.1 Productions|location=Chesterfield, MO|year=2000|isbn=0-615-11724-4|pages=180–81}}</ref>

=== 1974–1978: ''Venus and Mars'' to ''London Town'' ===
After ''Band on the Run'', [[Jimmy McCulloch]], former lead guitarist in [[Thunderclap Newman]] and [[Stone the Crows]], joined the band. The first Wings project with McCulloch was ''[[McGear]]'', a 1974 collaboration between Paul and his younger brother [[Mike McGear]], with session musician [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] playing drums. [[Warner Bros. Records]] chose not to play up the "Wings" angle in its marketing for ''McGear'', and the album sold poorly. However, the sessions also generated a single credited to McGear's group [[the Scaffold]], "Liverpool Lou", which became a top-10 hit in the UK. Shortly thereafter, [[Geoff Britton]] joined Wings on drums, and the first recording session with this full line-up was held in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where the band stayed at the farm of songwriter [[Curly Putman|Curly Putman Jr]].<ref name="Bailey">Bailey, Jerry.

In a rare occurrence for this era, both sides of the single separately reached the Billboard Top 20 in the US.

In between sections of the tour, Wings recorded ''[[Wings at the Speed of Sound]]'', which was released at the end of March 1976, just prior to the US leg of the world tour. It represented a departure from the previous Wings template in that each of the five members of the band (including English) sang lead on at least one song. However, the two singles, "[[Silly Love Songs]]" and "[[Let 'Em In]]" (the former a US number one), were both sung by Paul. Four of the album tracks were played in the 1976 portion of the tour, which also included five Beatles songs. One of the [[Seattle]] concerts from the American leg of the 1975–76 world tour was filmed and later released as the concert feature ''[[Rockshow]]'' (1980). The tour's American leg, which also included [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City and [[Boston Garden]] in Massachusetts, spawned a triple live album, ''[[Wings over America]]'' (1976), which became the fifth consecutive Wings album to reach number 1 in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paulmccartney.com/albums/10468-wings-over-america |title=Wings Over America |publisher=paulmccartney.com |access-date=15 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415122346/http://www.paulmccartney.com/albums/10468-wings-over-america |archive-date=15 April 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> From this album came a single release of the live version of "[[Maybe I'm Amazed]]"<ref name=Band106>{{cite book|last=McGee|first=Garry|title=Band on the Run: A History of Paul McCartney and Wings|year=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-87833-304-2|page=106}}</ref> originally from the ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]'' album.<ref>{{cite web |last=Calkin |first=Graham |url=http://www.jpgr.co.uk/r6017.html |title=Paul McCartney – Maybe I'm Amazed |publisher=Jpgr.co.uk |access-date=17 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116121224/http://www.jpgr.co.uk/r6017.html |archive-date=16 November 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The single's flipside was "[[Soily]]", a previously unreleased rocker that was often used as a closer for the concerts.

After the tour, and following the release of "Maybe I'm Amazed" in early 1977, Wings took a break. Later in the year, the band started recording their next album in the [[Virgin Islands]], but the sessions were interrupted by Linda's pregnancy and then by the departures of both McCulloch and English. McCulloch, who joined [[Small Faces]], died of morphine and alcohol poisoning in 1979. English joined [[Chuck Leavell]]'s band [[Sea Level (band)|Sea Level]] and later founded the Christian-oriented Joe English Band.

Undeterred by their departure, Wings released the already-completed McCartney–Laine ballad "[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]", an ode to the [[Mull of Kintyre|Scottish coastal region]] where McCartney had made his home in the early 1970s. Its broad appeal was maximised by a pre-Christmas release. It became an international hit, dominating the charts in Britain (where it was Wings' only number 1 single), Australia and many other countries over the Christmas/New Year period. Ultimately, it became the first single to exceed sales of 2 million in the UK, eclipsing the previous all-time best-seller (the Beatles' "She Loves You"), and remains one of the biggest-selling UK singles of all time. However, it was not a success in the US, where the B-side "Girls School" received most of the airplay but barely reached the top 40.

The core trio of Wings then released the album ''[[London Town (Wings album)|London Town]]'' in 1978. Though only the remaining trio are pictured on the sleeve, much of the album included McCulloch and English, having been recorded before their departures. Laine, however, remained and was co-credited on five of the tracks, including the title song.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/london-town-mw0000194661|title= London Town|last= Erlewine|first= Stephen Thomas|website= AllMusic|access-date= 11 March 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171105084821/https://www.allmusic.com/album/london-town-mw0000194661|archive-date= 5 November 2017|url-status= live}}</ref> It was a commercial success, although it became the first Wings album since ''Wild Life'' not to reach number 1 in the US (peaking at number 2).<ref>''Joel Whitburn Presents the Billboard Albums'', 6th edition. {{ISBN|0-89820-166-7}}</ref> ''London Town'' featured a markedly softer-rock, synth-based sound than previous Wings albums.

[[File:Steve Holley Rye 16 cropped.jpg|thumb|170x250px|[[Steve Holley]], the group's last drummer]]
Later in 1978, lead guitarist [[Laurence Juber]] and drummer [[Steve Holley]] joined the band, restoring Wings to touring strength. In 1979, McCartney signed a new record contract, leaving Capitol, the company he had been with in the US and Canada since he was a Beatle, and joining [[Columbia Records]], while remaining with Parlophone in the rest of the world. Influenced by the punk and new wave scenes, Wings abandoned its mellow touch and hired [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] to help in the production process. The result was a somewhat less polished sound. This new version of Wings released the disco-oriented single "[[Goodnight Tonight]]", backed by "[[Daytime Nighttime Suffering]]", which reached the top 5 in both the US and UK.<ref name=OCC/> However, the subsequent album ''[[Back to the Egg]]'' was not favourably received by critics and although it went platinum in the US, sales were disappointing in comparison to its immediate predecessors. It contained the [[Grammy]]-winning song "[[Rockestra Theme]]", the result of an October 1978 superstar session with members of Wings, [[the Who]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Pink Floyd]], among others.<ref>''McCartney: Songwriter'' {{ISBN|0-491-03325-7}} p. 122</ref> Three singles, "[[Old Siam, Sir]]" (UK only), "[[Getting Closer (song)|Getting Closer]]",<ref>''McCartney: Songwriter'' {{ISBN|0-491-03325-7}} p. 123</ref> and "[[Arrow Through Me]]" (US only), were culled from the album, but performed poorly on the charts. During much of 1979, Wings were inactive as McCartney worked on a new solo album (''[[McCartney II]]'') without the band.

In November and December 1979, Wings [[Wings UK Tour 1979|toured the UK]], once again adding the horns and brass section consisting of Tony Dorsey, Howie Casey, Thaddeus Richard, and Steve Howard. This tour climaxed with the [[Concerts for the People of Kampuchea]], a massive "[[Rockestra]]" all-star collection of musicians in London in aid of [[UNICEF]] and [[Kampuchea]]n refugees. Also during this tour, a live version of the ''McCartney II'' track "[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]" was recorded in Glasgow and became Wings' sixth US number one hit the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/wings-back-to-the-egg/|title=The Story of Wings' Last, Most Frustrating LP, 'Back to the Egg'|website=ultimateclassicrock.com|date=8 June 2015|access-date=8 November 2021}}</ref>

By 1980, McCartney was growing weary of maintaining Wings and his personal and professional aspirations began to diverge from the group. The McCartneys now had three school-age children and had moved out of London to the countryside of East Sussex, desiring that their children have a normal upbringing. Musically, McCartney was dissatisfied by the band's performances during the 1979 UK tour, and when rehearsals for the next album began in October, it was apparent his latest songs were not a good fit for the band. Consequently, he and George Martin, who would be producing the album, decided not to use Wings for recording. Instead, top session musicians and guest artists were brought in to make the best possible album.<ref>Green, Paul. "Martin/McCartney 'Tug' Team Scores" ''Billboard'' 26 February 1983: 60</ref> In November 1980, Holley and Juber were told they would not be needed for the new album and other than sessions in January 1981 to finish work on the ''[[Cold Cuts (Paul McCartney album)|Cold Cuts]]'' album of previously unreleased tracks, no further activities were scheduled for Wings.

Laine stayed on for the ''[[Tug of War (Paul McCartney album)|Tug of War]]'' sessions in [[Montserrat]] in February 1981 but his relationship with McCartney had become strained over business and personal matters. Laine had begun to feel that he was not being adequately compensated for his role in Wings, and was particularly bitter that he was employed as a contract writer on "Mull of Kintyre", a song he co-wrote with McCartney. He had been paid a flat fee for his contributions so when the song became a hit, he did not share in the royalties.{{refn|group=nb|After splitting with McCartney in 1981, Laine was paid an additional £135,000 ($255,000 in 1981) for "Mull of Kintyre".<ref>"Penniless Denny" ''[[The Times]]'' 17 December 1986</ref>}} Laine was also upset with McCartney over his drug arrest in Japan which meant a loss of extra income from the tour as well as putting future tour plans in doubt.

'''Suzy and the Red Stripes''' was a pseudonym used by the group for the release of the Linda McCartney and Wings single "[[Seaside Woman]]" in 1977. It was written and sung by Linda McCartney. It was the only release by Wings under that name. Linda said that the "Suzy and the Red Stripes" pseudonym came about because she had been called "Suzi" in Jamaica because of "a fantastic reggae version of 'Suzi Q'", and [[Red Stripe]] is Jamaica's leading brand of beer.<ref name="RS">Gambaccini, Paul [https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/paulmccartney/articles/story/9359339/the_rs_interview_paul_mccartney?source=paulmccartney_rssfeed "The RS Interview: Paul McCartney"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120162649/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/paulmccartney/articles/story/9359339/the_rs_interview_paul_mccartney?source=paulmccartney_rssfeed |date=20 January 2008 }}.

== Legacy ==
Wings had twelve top-10 singles (including one number one) in the UK and fourteen top 10 singles (including six number ones) in the US. All 23 singles released by Wings reached the US [[top 40]], and one two-sided hit, "Junior's Farm"/"Sally G", reached the top 40 with each side. Of the nine albums released by Wings, all went top 10 in either the UK or the US, with five consecutive albums topping the US charts. Paul McCartney was unquestionably Wings' leader and dominant creative force, but Denny Laine, Jimmy McCulloch, and Linda McCartney all contributed a little in songwriting, and Laine, McCulloch, Joe English, and Linda McCartney all performed a few lead vocals.

The success of Wings was a vindication for McCartney.<ref>Bronson, Fred. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&dq=paul+mccartney+wings+vindication&pg=PT445 "Silly Love Songs"], from ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits''; p. 436; Billboard Books, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-8230-7677-2}}. Retrieved on 3 June 2009.</ref> His first few post-Beatles albums were highly criticized and often dismissed by critics as "lightweight" next to the more serious nature of his former bandmates' solo output. But by the mid-1970s, the solo careers of the other three former Beatles were in varying degrees of decline, with John Lennon putting his career on hold in 1975 for the first five years of his son [[Sean Lennon|Sean]]'s life. A year later, [[George Harrison]] had all but retired from live performances, with his new releases failing to match the success of his initial solo output. [[Ringo Starr]] was living in Los Angeles and was writing and recording, but as a solo artist had not been performing onstage other than rare guest appearances. Meanwhile, Wings continued to tour regularly and enjoy much commercial success. According to author [[Robert Rosen (writer)|Robert Rosen]], by 1980, Lennon was envious enough of McCartney's continuing success to make his re-emergence on the music scene.<ref>Rosen, Robert.

In an interview, Juber, Wings' third lead guitarist, said, "I was a sideman, but the job assignment very much included considering myself a part of the band ... In all its incarnations Wings sounded like a band, not like a solo McCartney project and I think that reflects well not only on Paul's ability to share in the creative process, but also on the importance of Denny and Linda's contributions, too. The other players brought their own personalities to the scene."<ref name="Juberint"/>

In addition to its own output, Wings recorded several songs that were released through various outlets both before and after the band's break-up. Denny Laine's 1977 solo album ''[[Holly Days]]'' was a joint effort by Laine with Paul and Linda McCartney;<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Dave |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/holly-days-mw0000538847 |title=Holly Days – Denny Laine : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |access-date=18 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707093533/http://www.allmusic.com/album/holly-days-mw0000538847 |archive-date=7 July 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> three songs on Laine's 1980 solo album ''[[Japanese Tears]]'' were performed by Wings with Laine on lead vocals; Laine also contributed to several songs on Paul McCartney's 1982 and 1983 solo albums ''Tug of War'' and ''Pipes of Peace'', respectively. Juber's instrumental "Maisie"—which was backed by members of Wings—appeared on his solo album ''[[Standard Time (album)|Standard Time]]''. The McCartneys and Laine contributed backing vocals to George Harrison's 1981 tribute to John Lennon, "[[All Those Years Ago]]". Linda McCartney continued to tour and record with her husband up until her death in 1998, after which a compilation of her songs entitled ''[[Wide Prairie]]'' was released that featured seven Wings songs written or co-written by her. Wings also backed Paul's brother [[Mike McGear]] on the ''[[McGear]]'' album, as well as McGear's band [[the Scaffold]] on the single "Liverpool Lou" and its B-side "Ten Years After on Strawberry Jam". Paul McCartney also used three unreleased Wings songs as B-sides of his solo singles several years after Wings' break-up.

Wings' 1977 single "Mull of Kintyre"/"Girls School" is still the biggest-selling non-charity single in the UK (although [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" sold more, its sales include a reissue in aid of the [[Terrence Higgins Trust]]),<ref>Morgan-Gann, Theo.
