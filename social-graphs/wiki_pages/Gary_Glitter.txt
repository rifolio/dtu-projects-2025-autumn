'''Paul Francis Gadd''' (born 8 May 1944), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Gary Glitter''', is an English former singer who achieved fame and success during the 1970s and 1980s. His career ended after his 1999 conviction of downloading [[child pornography]]. He was also convicted of [[child sexual abuse]] in 2006 and a series of sexual offences (including attempted [[rape]]) in 2015.

After performing under the name Paul Raven during the 1960s, Gadd changed his stage name to Gary Glitter in the early 1970s and had a sustained solo career with his hits "[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll (Parts 1 and 2)]]", "[[Do You Wanna Touch Me]]", "[[I Love You Love Me Love]]", "[[I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)]]", and "[[Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again]]". He became known for his energetic live performances and [[glam rock]] persona of glitter suits, make-up, and platform boots. He has sold over 20 million records and had 26 hit [[Single (music)|singles]], which spent a total of 180 weeks in the [[UK Singles Chart]], with 12 reaching the top 10 and three of those charting at number one.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polyhex.com/music/chartruns/chartruns.php/chartruns.php |website=polyhex.com |title=UK singles chartruns |access-date=18 June 2007 |archive-date=13 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613143022/http://www.polyhex.com/music/chartruns/chartruns.php/chartruns.php |url-status=live}}</ref>{{better source needed|reason=Need to run a search to get the info.

==Career==

===Early work as Paul Raven===
By the time he was 16, Gadd was already performing at London clubs. His career grew as he appeared at such venues as the [[The 2i's Coffee Bar|Two I's]] in [[Soho]], and the Laconda and Safari Clubs. His repertoire consisted of early [[rock and roll]] [[Standard (music)|standards]] and gentle [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]].<ref name="Thompson"/> Gadd gained his first break when film producer [[Robert Hartford-Davis]] discovered him and financed a recording session for [[Decca Records]]. In January 1960, at 15, under the stage name Paul Raven, he released his first single, "Alone in the Night".<ref name="The Times">{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.com/best-law-firms/profile-legal/article/nowhere-to-call-home-how-friends-family-and-the-world-have-shunned-gary-glitter-np5s6jcd88n |work=[[The Times]] |location= London |title=Nowhere to call home: how friends, family and the world have shunned Gary Glitter |date=21 August 2008 |first=Valentine |last=Low |access-date=<!--Not verified at this URL due to paywall.

A year later, with a new manager, Vic Billings, he signed a new recording contract with [[Parlophone]] and worked with record producer [[George Martin]], before Martin's association with [[the Beatles]]. Martin produced two singles, "Walk on Boy" and "[[Tower of Strength (Gene McDaniels song)|Tower of Strength]]", but neither sold very well, and Gadd's recording career as Paul Raven stalled. By 1964, he was reduced to working as an assistant, and playing the warm-up for the British music television programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' He did numerous television commercials and film auditions, and in the course of those activities met arranger and record producer [[Mike Leander]], who eventually helped revive his career.  He auditioned for the role of the protagonist in the film ''[[Privilege (film)|Privilege]]'' (1967), which was written and directed by [[Peter Watkins]], known for the television drama ''[[The War Game]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Still using the name Paul Raven, Gadd joined the Mike Leander Show Band in early 1965. He was then deputised to produce a few recording sessions by such artists as Thane Russell and a Scottish [[freakbeat]] band, [[the Poets]].<ref name="Thompson"/><ref name="DAgostino 2001 p. 208">{{cite book | last=D'Agostino | first=G. | title=Glam Musik: British Glam Music '70 History | publisher=Writers Club Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-595-16563-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdDZeCqeQwsC&pg=PA208 | access-date=18 December 2021 | page=208}}</ref> After Leander's group disbanded, he formed Boston International with saxophonist John Rossall, and spent the following five years touring the UK and [[West Germany]], recording occasionally. From 1968 to 1970, several singles including "Musical Man", "Goodbye Seattle" and a cover version of the Beatles' "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" were released, his name briefly changed to Paul Monday. He sang the role of a priest in the original 1970 concept album of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (album)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jesuschristsuperstarzone.com/knowledge-base/discography/original-concept-recording/ |title=Original Concept Recording (1970) – ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200711215334/http://www.jesuschristsuperstarzone.com/knowledge-base/discography/original-concept-recording/ |archive-date=11 July 2020 |website=Jesus Christ Superstar Zone}} (Reference for this and subsequent sections)</ref>

===Gary Glitter===
[[File:Gary Glitter - TopPop 1973 3.png|thumb|Glitter in 1973, during an appearance on ''[[TopPop]]'']]
As the [[Glam rock|glam]] movement took off in 1971, Gadd adopted the new stage name Gary Glitter, which he devised by playing alliteratively with letters of the alphabet, working backwards from Z. Other options included Terry Tinsel, Stanley Sparkle and Vicky Vomit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4766890.stm|title=Profile: Gary Glitter|work=BBC News|access-date=27 September 2014|archive-date=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011183123/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4766890.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The song that made Gary Glitter's name began as a 15-minute [[jam session]]; whittled down to a pair of three-minute extracts it was released in 1972 as the [[A-side and B-side]] of a single called "[[Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)|Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2]]". Part 2 proved to be the more popular side in many countries, although it took about six months before it made its full impact, going to No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reaching the Top Ten in the United States, one of the few British glam rock records to do so. "Rock and Roll Part 1" was also a hit: in France it made number-one, and in the UK both sides were listed together on the charts.

===Mainstream success===
"Rock and Roll" was followed by other successes over the next three years. Glitter, backed by the [[Glittermen]]/[[the Glitter Band]] on stage, competed with [[David Bowie]], [[Elton John]], [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Slade]] and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] for domination of the charts. To reinforce his image, he reportedly owned 30 glitter suits and fifty pairs of silver [[platform boot]]s. He also released several singles which became UK Top 10 hits, with "[[I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)]]" being his first single to reach the number-one position in the summer of 1973, and "[[I Love You Love Me Love]]", its follow-up, his second. Even an atypical ballad, "[[Remember Me This Way (Gary Glitter song)|Remember Me This Way]]", went to No. 3. He had eleven consecutive Top 10 singles, from "Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2" in 1972 to "[[Doing Alright with the Boys]]" in the summer of 1975.<ref name="UKcharts">{{cite web | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14601/gary-glitter/ | title=Gary Glitter songs and albums | website=Official Charts | access-date=24 April 2024 | archive-date=4 June 2023<!--Later archives unfortunately fail to capture the information needed to verify the above--> | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230604031554/https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14601/gary-glitter/ | url-status=live}}</ref> "Rock and Roll (Part 2)" caught on as a popular [[Stadium anthem|sports anthem]] in North America.<ref name=yahoo/>

Despite his success in the UK, Glitter never made the same impact in America where, at best, glam rock was seen as a curiosity. Glitter had one more entry on the US charts with "[[I Didn't Know I Loved You (Till I Saw You Rock and Roll)]]"; after that, the closest chart success for Glitter was a cover recording of "I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)" by [[Brownsville Station (band)|Brownsville Station]].

After "Doing Alright with the Boys", Glitter won the award for Best Male Artist at the ''Saturday Scene'' music awards hosted by [[London Weekend Television|LWT]]. His next release was a cover of [[the Rivingtons]]' novelty [[Nonsense|nonsensical]] doo-wop song "[[Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow]]", but it got no higher than No. 38 on the British charts.<ref name=UKcharts/> After subsequent releases stalled in similar fashion, Glitter announced his retirement from the music industry to start a family life with his new partner in early 1976. That same year, his first hits package, simply titled ''Greatest Hits'', was released. It entered the UK Top 40 best-seller charts. A similar budget album, entitled ''I Love You Love Me Love'', was issued by [[Sonar Entertainment|Hallmark Entertainment]] the following year.

===Comeback and business interests===
In 1976, Glitter faced declining record sales. He took a two-year-long exile, living in France and Australia, before returning to the UK, and beginning his comeback.

Glitter's career took a downturn towards the end of the 1970s, leading him to declare bankruptcy in 1977, though he later blamed the high [[tax rate]] in the UK at the time.<ref name=Russell/><ref name=feb15>{{cite news |title=Gary Glitter: Glamour rock star to paedophile |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31111208 |url-status=live |work=BBC News |date=5 February 2015 |access-date=7 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305214948/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31111208 |archive-date=5 March 2015}}</ref> He entered bankruptcy a second time over unpaid tax in the 1990s. Under financial pressure, not even a pair of Top 40 hit singles ("[[It Takes All Night Long]]" and "[[A Little Boogie Woogie in the Back of My Mind]]") could lift him all the way back. It took the [[post-punk]] audience, and some of its artists who still respected Glitter's work, to do that; he had been an influence on post-punk, [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Britpop]] and [[glam metal]], as well as early [[punk rock]] itself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Punk History |website=The Punk Music Scene |url=http://www.caughtoffguard.co.uk/punk_history.html |quote=individuals such as Gary Glitter have all been honoured as strong influences in Punk<!--sic: capitalisation--> rock evolution |access-date=25 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314231819/http://www.caughtoffguard.co.uk/punk_history.html |archive-date=14 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Duda |first=Christopher |title=The Vibrators – Interview with Knox |website=SugarBuzz Magazine |url=http://www.sugarbuzzmagazine.com/bands/vibrators/vibrators.html |quote=I liked Gary Glitter, Hello, Slade; they were all laying the roots to punk |access-date=25 April 2013 |archive-date=1 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301185652/http://www.sugarbuzzmagazine.com/bands/vibrators/vibrators.html | url-status=live}}</ref> Around this time, Glitter settled into being a performer with a niche following that continued until his conviction for downloading [[child pornography]] in 1999. This helped provide the opportunity for Glitter to cut a dance medley of his greatest hits, "All That Glitters", which charted in 1981. Within three years he was playing 80 shows a year at colleges and [[nightclub]]s, and had chart hits "[[Dance Me Up]]" (UK No. 25) and "[[Another Rock and Roll Christmas]]" (UK No. 7).<ref name=UKcharts/>

Glitter's comeback was boosted in the 1980s by various guest spots and collaborations. In 1982, he appeared on the [[British Electric Foundation]] album ''Music of Quality and Distinction Volume One'' (UK No. 25) along with fellow pop/rock luminaries [[Sandie Shaw]] and [[Tina Turner]]. In 1988, [[The KLF|the Timelords]]' "[[Doctoring the Tardis]]", a ''[[Doctor Who]]'' tribute that sampled "Rock and Roll (Part 2)", reached the number-one spot. In due course, Glitter re-cut "Rock and Roll" with producer [[Trevor Horn]] and also "I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)" with [[Girlschool]]. In the late 1980s, his hit singles were used to compile the Telstar-released ''C'mon... C'mon – The Gary Glitter Party Album''. In 1989, [[Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers]] put a large sample of "Another Rock and Roll Christmas" on their number-one UK hit "[[Let's Party (Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers song)|Let's Party]]". In 1987 Glitter received a ten-year driving ban and narrowly escaped imprisonment after a third conviction for [[Drunk driving law by country|drink-driving]].<ref name="Glitter profile"/>

He had signed to Virgin after leaving [[Arista Records]] in 1984 after twelve years with the label. Attitude Records was merged into Machmain Ltd later in the 1990s, a music company owned by Glitter.

Glitter spent the next decade mostly as an in-demand live performer, and his back catalogue of recordings proved durable enough for several compilations to be successfully released. He appeared in billboard and poster advertisements for [[British Rail]], in one of which he was shown attempting to look younger to obtain a [[16–25 Railcard|Young Person's Railcard]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.advertisingarchives.co.uk/detail/39611/1/Magazine-Advert/Young-Persons-Railcard/1990s | title=Young Persons Railcard | publisher=Advertising Archives | access-date=28 January 2015 | archive-date=20 November 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120164748/http://www.advertisingarchives.co.uk/detail/39611/1/Magazine-Advert/Young-Persons-Railcard/1990s | url-status=live}}</ref> He also released a new studio album, ''[[Leader II]]'', in 1991.

===Career moves since 2001===
In September 2001, he released a new studio album, ''[[On (Gary Glitter album)|On]]'', which included material written before his 1999 British conviction. That material was to have been part of a project called ''Lost on Life Street'' until that album's release was cancelled following his arrest. By December 2004, after releasing a new single, "Control", Glitter was in the news again concerning his behaviour; NGOs had been petitioning the government with their own evidence aimed at arresting Glitter. He moved to Vietnam.

In 2002, [[Snapper Music]] re-promoted ''[[The Ultimate Gary Glitter – 25 Years of Hits]]'', a two-disc compilation album of Glitter's music initially released in 1997, days after his arrest, which covers his commercial breakthrough in 1972 through to 1984 while also including a song that was later released on ''On'', and singles by his former backing band the Glitter Band without him; again it was moderately successful.

In 2005 ''[[Remember Me This Way (film)|Remember Me This Way]]'', the documentary filmed at Glitter's career peak in 1973 (and originally released in 1974), was issued for the first time on DVD. Glitter's music itself still had an audience, further demonstrated by three new album releases, although all of them contained past recordings from the vaults, rather than new product. The first two new albums were issued at the same time, ''The Remixes'' and ''Live in Concert'' (the latter of which was a 1981 recording). These were only for sale on the Internet. A new collection of Glitter's chart hit singles followed, ''The Best of Gary Glitter''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/glitter_gary/958559/album.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112112347/http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/glitter_gary/958559/album.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 January 2008 |title= Gary Glitter Album Download|publisher=[[VH1]]}}</ref> In 2006 his back catalogue was made available via the Internet from sites such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] and [[eMusic]].

In 2011 a collection of hits and B-sides was issued under the title ''All that Glitters''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-That-Glitters-Best-Glitter/dp/B005PYFQ14/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1350605736&sr=8-8 |title=All That Glitters – The Best of Gary Glitter: Amazon.co.uk: Music |website=Amazon UK |access-date=11 November 2012 |archive-date=11 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231111133735/https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-That-Glitters-Best-Glitter/dp/B005PYFQ14/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1350605736&sr=8-8 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{better source needed|reason=Retail website is volatile, not an ideal source|date=April 2024}}

News reports stated that, as of late July 2013, Glitter may have earned a total of £1,000,000 from royalties derived from the Oasis song "Hello" that sampled "Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again". Music industry lawyer Craig Brookes cited this monetary sum in addition to the royalties from his back catalogue of songs—£300,000 a year or more—and the estimated £200,000 Glitter was awarded for [[copyright infringement]] after he enacted legal action against Oasis in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gary Glitter may earn £1m from Oasis royalties |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/29/gary-glitter-royalties-oasis-1m |access-date=30 July 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 July 2013 |last=Gibsone |first=Harriet |archive-date=31 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731102535/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/29/gary-glitter-royalties-oasis-1m |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2014, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that "Rock and Roll Part 2", co-written by Glitter with [[Mike Leander]], was earning an estimated $250,000 a year in royalties due to its use in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/6273999/why-convicted-child-sex-offender-gary-glitters-hey | title=Why Convicted Child-Sex Offender Gary Glitter's 'Hey Song' Is Still Getting Played | magazine=Billboard | date=3 October 2014 | access-date=28 February 2015 | archive-date=3 March 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303051602/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/6273999/why-convicted-child-sex-offender-gary-glitters-hey | url-status=live}}</ref>

==Sexual offences==
===1997 arrest and 1999 conviction===
In November 1997, Gadd was arrested after a technician discovered [[Child pornography|pornographic images of children]] on the hard drive of a laptop that he had taken to a computer retailer in [[Bristol]] to be repaired. Further images were discovered by police during searches of his homes in London and Wedmore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1997/nov/20/alexbellos|title=Gary Glitter facing child porn inquiry|first=Alex|last=Bellos|date=20 November 1997|website=The Guardian|access-date=16 June 2018|archive-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614172402/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1997/nov/20/alexbellos|url-status=live}}</ref> He was castigated in the media over the allegations; additionally, his appearance in the [[Spice Girls]]' musical comedy film ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'' was cut, though a truncated edit of the scene, featuring a cover of "I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)", was retained.

At [[Bristol Crown Court]] on 12 November 1999, Mr Justice Butterfield sentenced Gadd to four months in prison and placed him on the [[sex offender]] register in the UK after he admitted downloading more than 4,000 items of child pornography.<ref name="Glitter jailed over child porn"/> He was acquitted of a charge of having sex with a 14-year-old girl with whom he had a relationship in the late 1970s.<ref name="Gary Glitter 1991"/> It was later revealed that the complainant sold her story to the ''[[News of the World]]'' and stood to earn more money from the newspaper should Gadd be convicted.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/550343.stm |work=BBC News |title=Press warned over witness payments |date=5 December 1999 |access-date=4 January 2010 |archive-date=12 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912042947/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/550343.stm |url-status=live}}</ref>

In late 2002, he was detained over his previous sex offences and spent four days in jail before being released on bail.

===Conviction and release in Vietnam===
From March 2005, Gadd resided in [[Vũng Tàu]], Vietnam, where he rented a luxury seaside villa and applied for permanent Vietnamese residency. He came to the attention of Vietnamese authorities after being banned from a nightclub for allegedly groping a teenage waitress; eyewitnesses also reported seeing him take two young girls into his home. On 12 November 2005, he fled his home. A 15-year-old girl was found living in his flat and was questioned by authorities. Police began searching for Gadd, and he was arrested on 20 November at [[Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport]] in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] while trying to board a flight to Bangkok. Six Vietnamese girls and women, aged from 11 to 23, claimed that Gadd had had sex with them.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4454486.stm| title=Glitter 'had sex with girl, 12'|work=BBC News| date=21 November 2005| access-date=4 January 2010| archive-date=22 February 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222025958/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4454486.stm| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/20/arts.childprotection|title=Glitter arrested over child sex as he tries to flee Vietnam|first1=Antony|last1=Barnett|first2=John|last2=Aglionby|date=20 November 2005|website=The Guardian|access-date=27 January 2019|archive-date=15 April 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240415183346/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/20/arts.childprotection|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-11-20/gary-glitter-arrested-in-vietnam-reports/744212|title=Gary Glitter arrested in Vietnam: reports|date=20 November 2005|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=27 July 2018|archive-date=15 April 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240415183212/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-11-20/gary-glitter-arrested-in-vietnam-reports/744212|url-status=live}}</ref>

After his arrest, Gadd was turned over to provincial police from Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu, returned to Vũng Tàu, and held on suspicion of having sex with the two underage girls. Gadd was held in jail throughout the criminal investigation, which was completed on 26 December 2005. The charge of rape was dropped for "lack of evidence" (according to Gadd's lawyer), although Gadd admitted that an 11-year-old girl had slept in his bed. Gadd could have faced [[Capital punishment in Vietnam|execution by firing squad]] had he been convicted of child rape.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/glitter-may-face-firing-squad-over-child-sex-allegations-516355.html |title=Glitter may face firing squad over child-sex allegations |date=22 November 2005 |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=16 June 2018}}</ref> After having received compensatory payments from Gadd, the families of the girls appealed for clemency for him.<ref name="bbc4559658">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4559658.stm |work=BBC News |title=Glitter police 'drop rape charge' |date=26 December 2005 |access-date=4 January 2010 |archive-date=16 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116151115/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4559658.stm |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 2 March 2006, Gadd was tried on charges of committing obscene acts with two girls, aged 10 and 11, facing up to 14 years in prison if convicted. The following day, he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison.

In an interview with [[BBC News]] in May 2006, Gadd denied that he was a [[Pedophilia|paedophile]] and claimed not to have knowingly had sex with anyone under 18. He said that he had hoped to put his life back on track and have a career after he left prison in England. He continued to blame the press for his downfall and called them "the worst enemy in the world", alleging that they had paid girls in a bar to arrange a photo scoop.

Gadd served his sentence in Thủ Đức Prison in southern [[Bình Thuận province]]. He shared a cell with 18 other foreign inmates and was exempted from hard labour because of his age. In 2007, he suffered from high blood pressure, and was put on medication and told to stop buying beer from the prison canteen. In January 2008, after being taken to a prison clinic for treatment of intestinal problems, tests showed that Gadd also had an irregular heartbeat. Later that month, he suffered a heart attack and collapsed in his cell. He was taken to a hospital in [[Phan Thiết]], where he was kept under police guard.

British [[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]] said that Gadd should be given a Foreign Travel Order (FTO) banning him from overseas travel: "We need to control him, and he will be [controlled] once he returns to this country."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=e5a26c44cb0eb110VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&ss=Hong+Kong&s=News |title=Paedophile rock star flies into Hong Kong |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=21 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011215424/http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2af62ecb329d3d7733492d9253a0a0a0/?vgnextoid=e5a26c44cb0eb110VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&ss=Hong%2BKong&s=News |archive-date=11 October 2008|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

Gadd was released on 19 August 2008. He was escorted under police guard to [[Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport]] in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and put on a flight to London via Bangkok. In Bangkok, he claimed that he had [[tinnitus]] and a heart condition and refused to board the flight to London despite the efforts of British police sent to escort him, although they had no jurisdiction to take action. A doctor attending to him airside diagnosed Gadd with [[costochondritis]], prescribed him painkillers, and declared him fit for travel. Gadd continued to refuse to leave. He booked himself into a transit lounge room and claimed he was a "free man". He was refused admission to Thailand as a threat to domestic morality. Thai immigration officials gave him a deadline to leave the country, and warned that he would be detained and deported to the UK if he did not leave voluntarily.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/2590974/Gary-Glitter-given-unconditional-deadline-to-leave-Thailand.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/2590974/Gary-Glitter-given-unconditional-deadline-to-leave-Thailand.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Gary Glitter given 'unconditional' deadline to leave Thailand|date=20 August 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=16 June 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7569348.stm|work=BBC News|title=Gary Glitter flown out of Vietnam|date=19 August 2008|access-date=4 January 2010|archive-date=28 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328172248/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7569348.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7571429.stm |title='Heart attack' halts Glitter trip |work=BBC News |date=19 August 2008 |access-date=4 January 2010 |archive-date=7 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907164522/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7571429.stm |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7573812.stm |work=BBC News |title=Gary Glitter returns to Thailand |date=21 August 2008 |access-date=4 January 2010 |archive-date=3 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603123910/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7573812.stm |url-status=live}}</ref>
