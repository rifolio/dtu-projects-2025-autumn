'''Janis Lyn Joplin''' (January 19, 1943 – October 4, 1970) was an American singer and songwriter. One of the most iconic and successful [[Rock music|rock]] performers of her era, she was noted for her powerful [[mezzo-soprano]] vocals and her "electric" stage presence.

In 1967, Joplin rose to prominence following an appearance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], where she was the lead singer of the then little-known San Francisco [[psychedelic rock]] band [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]]. After releasing two albums with the band, she left Big Brother to continue as a solo artist with her own backing groups, first the {{interlanguage link|Kozmic Blues Band|it||pt}} and then the [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]]. She performed at the 1969 [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] and on the ''[[Festival Express]]'' train tour. Five singles by Joplin reached the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Kris Kristofferson]] song "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]", which posthumously reached number one in March 1971. Her most popular songs include her cover versions of "[[Piece of My Heart]]", "[[Cry Baby (Garnet Mimms song)|Cry Baby]]", "[[Down on Me (traditional song)|Down on Me]]", "[[Ball and Chain (Big Mama Thornton song)|Ball and Chain]]", and "[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]", as well as her original song "[[Mercedes Benz (song)|Mercedes Benz]]", which was her final recording.

Joplin died of a [[heroin]] overdose in 1970, at the [[27 Club|age of 27]], after releasing three albums (two with Big Brother and the Holding Company and one solo album). A second solo album, ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]'', was released in January 1971, three months after her death. It reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. She was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Joplin  number 28 on its 2008 list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 200 Greatest Singers of All Time|200 Greatest Singers of All Time]]", dropping to number 78 in the 2023 list. As of 2013, she remains one of the top-selling vocalists in the United States, with [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) certifications of 18.5&nbsp;million albums sold.

== Career ==
=== 1962–1965: Early recordings ===
Joplin cultivated a rebellious manner and styled herself partly after her female blues heroines and partly after the [[Beat Generation|Beat poets]]. Her first song, "[[What Good Can Drinkin' Do]]", was recorded on tape in December 1962 at the home of a fellow University of Texas student.<ref name="Paytress 1994">{{Cite magazine |last=Paytress |first=Mark |title=Janis Joplin.

This session included seven tracks: "Typewriter Talk", "[[Trouble in Mind (song)|Trouble in Mind]]", "Kansas City Blues", "[[Hesitation Blues]]", "[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]", "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy", and "Long Black Train Blues", and was released long after Joplin's death as the [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] album ''The Typewriter Tape''.

In 1963, Joplin was arrested in San Francisco for shoplifting. During the two years that followed, her drug use increased and she acquired a reputation as a "speed freak" and occasional heroin user.<ref name="scars" /><ref name="amburn" /><ref name="caserta">{{Cite book |title=Going Down With Janis |first=Peggy |last=Caserta |author-link=Peggy Caserta |publisher=[[Dell Publishing]] |date=1980 |isbn=978-0-440-13194-6}}</ref> She also used other [[psychoactive drugs]] and was a heavy drinker throughout her career; her favorite alcoholic beverage was [[Southern Comfort]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 22, 2015|title=Janis Joplin's creed was 'get stoned, stay happy' but the highs had a dark side|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/22/janis-joplin-teenage-traumas-little-girl-blue|access-date=February 17, 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-date=January 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210112235336/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/22/janis-joplin-teenage-traumas-little-girl-blue|url-status=live}}</ref> In May 1965, Joplin's friends in San Francisco, noticing the detrimental effects on her from regularly injecting [[methamphetamine]]—she was described as "skeletal"<ref name="amburn" /> and "emaciated"<ref name="scars" />— persuaded her to return to Port Arthur. During that month, her friends threw her a [[rent party|bus-fare party]] so she could return to her parents in Texas.<ref name="scars" /> Five years later, Joplin told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine writer David Dalton the following about her first stint in San Francisco: "I didn't have many friends and I didn't like the ones I had."<ref name="dalton" />

Back in Port Arthur in the spring of 1965, after Joplin's parents noticed her weight of {{convert|88|lb}},<ref name="buried" /> she changed her lifestyle. She avoided drugs and alcohol, adopted a [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] hairdo, and enrolled as an [[anthropology]] major at [[Lamar University]] in nearby Beaumont, Texas.

In 1965 and 1966, Joplin commuted from her family's Port Arthur home to Beaumont, Texas, where she had regular sessions with a psychiatric social worker named Bernard Giarritano<ref name="buried" /> at a counseling agency that was funded by the United Fund (now the [[United Way]]).<ref name="scars" /> {{Relevance inline|reason=Why does it matter who her counseling agency was funded by?|date=September 2025}} Interviewed by biographer Myra Friedman after his client's death, Giarritano said Joplin had been baffled by how she could pursue a professional career as a singer without relapsing into drugs, and her drug-related memories from immediately prior to returning to Port Arthur continued to frighten her.<ref name="buried" /> Joplin sometimes brought an acoustic guitar with her to her sessions with Giarritano, and people in other offices within the building could hear her singing.<ref name="scars" /> Giarritano tried to reassure her that she did not have to use narcotics to succeed in the music business.<ref name="buried" /> She also said that if she were to avoid singing professionally, she would have to become a keypunch operator, as she had done a few years earlier, or a secretary, and then a wife and mother, and she would have to become similar to all the other women in Port Arthur.<ref name="buried" /> Approximately a year before Joplin joined [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], she recorded seven studio tracks with her acoustic guitar. Among the songs she recorded were her original composition of "Turtle Blues" and an alternate version of "Cod'ine" by [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]]. These tracks were later released as an album in 1995, titled ''This is Janis Joplin 1965''.

In June 1966, Joplin was still strict about drug use and when she shared an apartment with Travis Rivers upon their arrival in San Francisco, she made him promise that using needles would not be allowed there.<ref name="buried" /> When bandmate Dave Getz accompanied her from a rehearsal to her home, Rivers was not there, but "two or three", according to Getz' recollection 25 years later, guests whom Rivers had invited were in the process of injecting drugs.<ref name="buried" /> "One of them was about to tie off," recalled Getz.<ref name="buried" /> "''Janis went nuts!'' I had never seen anybody explode like that. She was screaming and crying and Travis walked in. She screamed at him: 'We had a pact! You promised me! There wouldn't be any of that in front of me!' I was over my head and I tried to calm her down. I said, 'They're just doing [[mescaline]],' because that's what I thought it was. She said, 'You don't understand! I can't see that! I just can't stand to see that!'"<ref name="buried" />

The debut album spawned four minor hits sung by Joplin including "[[Down on Me (traditional song)|Down on Me]]", a traditional song arranged by Joplin, "Bye Bye Baby", "Call On Me" and "Coo Coo".

After splitting from Big Brother and the Holding Company, Joplin formed a new backup group, the Kozmic Blues Band, composed of session musicians like keyboardist Stephen Ryder and saxophonist Cornelius "Snooky" Flowers, as well as former Big Brother and the Holding Company guitarist [[Sam Andrew]] and future [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]] bassist Brad Campbell. The band was influenced by the [[Stax Records|Stax-Volt]] [[rhythm and blues]] (R&B) and soul bands of the 1960s, as exemplified by [[Otis Redding]] and [[the Bar-Kays]].<ref name="scars" /><ref name="amburn" /><ref name="buried" /> By early 1969, Joplin was allegedly shooting at least $200 worth of heroin per day ({{Inflation|US|200|1969|fmt=eq}})<ref name="caserta" /> although efforts were made to keep her clean during the recording of ''[[I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!]]'', [[Gabriel Mekler]], who produced the album, kept her away from drugs and her drug-using friends during the record's production.<ref name="buried" /> Joplin's appearances with the Kozmic Blues Band in Europe were released in theaters, in multiple documentaries. ''[[Janis (film)|Janis]]'', which was reviewed by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on March 21, 1975,<ref>{{cite news |title='Janis': Purified Joplin |last=Zito |first=Tom |date=March 21, 1975 |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=B11}}</ref> shows Joplin arriving in [[Frankfurt]] by plane. The film ''Janis'' includes interviews with Joplin in Stockholm and from her visit to [[London]], for her gig at [[Royal Albert Hall]]. John Byrne Cooke, road manager for Joplin and the Kozmic Blues Band, wrote a book about her ongoing use of narcotics, particularly when she was outside the United States.<ref name="on the road">{{Cite book |title=On the Road With Janis Joplin |first=John Byrne |last=Cooke |author-link=John Byrne Cooke |year=2014 |publisher=Berkley Books |isbn=978-0-425-27411-8 }}</ref> On the episode of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' that was telecast in the United States on the night of July 18, 1969, Joplin and her band performed "Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)" as well as "[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]".

They did not recognize her or pay attention to her.]]
Joplin performed at [[Woodstock]] starting at approximately 2:00&nbsp;a.m., on Sunday, August 17, 1969. Joplin had informed her band that they would be performing at the concert as if it were just another gig. Joplin was flown by helicopter with the pregnant [[Joan Baez]] and Baez's mother to the festival site.  During the helicopter ride, she saw the enormous crowd and instantly became extremely nervous and giddy, as Baez recalled.<ref name="auto1">{{cite book |last=Baez |first=Joan |title=And a Voice to Sing With |publisher=Summit Books |year=1989 |pages=163–166}}</ref> Initially, Joplin was eager to get on the stage and perform, but was repeatedly delayed as bands were contractually obliged to perform ahead of Joplin. Faced with a ten-hour wait after arriving at the backstage area, Joplin spent some of that time shooting heroin and drinking alcohol<ref name="amburn" /><ref name="caserta" /> with her friend and sometimes lover [[Peggy Caserta]] in a tent. Joplin pulled through, and engaged frequently with the crowd, asking them if they had everything they needed and if they were staying stoned. The audience cheered for an encore, to which Joplin replied and sang "Ball and Chain". [[Pete Townshend]], who performed with [[the Who]] later in the same morning after Joplin finished, witnessed her performance and said in his 2012 memoir, "She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn't at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she'd consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible."<ref>{{cite book |last=Townshend |first=Pete |title=Who I am: a memoir |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2012 |pages=179}}</ref> Janis remained at Woodstock for the remainder of the festival. Starting at approximately 3:00&nbsp;a.m. on Monday, August 18, Joplin was among many Woodstock performers who stood in a circle behind [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] during their performance.<ref name="Crosby 1988 161–162">{{cite book |last=Crosby |first=David |title=Long Time Gone |publisher=Doubleday|year=1988 |pages=161–162}}</ref> This information was published by [[David Crosby]] in 1988.<ref name="Crosby 1988 161–162" /> Later in the morning of August 18, Joplin and Joan Baez sat in [[Joe Cocker]]'s van and witnessed [[list of performances and events at Woodstock Festival#Sunday, August 17 to Monday, August 18|Hendrix's close-of-show performance]], according to Baez's memoir ''And a Voice to Sing With'' (1989).<ref name="auto1"/>

Joplin was unhappy with her performance, however, and her singing was not included, by her own insistence, in the 1970 documentary film or the soundtrack for ''[[Woodstock: Music from the Original Soundtrack and More]]'' (although the 25th anniversary director's cut of ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' includes her performance of "[[Work Me, Lord]]"). Joplin was arrested for using "[[profanity|vulgar and indecent language]]" on November 16, 1969, at the [[Curtis Hixon Hall]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] after yelling "Don't fuck with those people!" toward police officers doing crowd control, for which she was found guilty and fined $200 plus court costs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Calise |first1=Gabrielle |title=How Janis Joplin was arrested in Tampa 50 years ago |url=https://www.tampabay.com/news/tampa/2019/11/14/how-janis-joplin-was-arrested-in-tampa-50-years-ago/ |access-date=September 25, 2023 |date=November 14, 2019 |archive-date=September 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230924105601/https://www.tampabay.com/news/tampa/2019/11/14/how-janis-joplin-was-arrested-in-tampa-50-years-ago/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tampabay.com/news/tampa/2019/11/14/how-janis-joplin-was-arrested-in-tampa-50-years-ago/|title=How Janis Joplin was arrested in Tampa 50 years ago|website=Tampa Bay Times}}</ref> In addition to Woodstock and her Tampa concert, in 1969 Joplin had problems at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Her publicist-turned-biographer Myra Friedman said, after Joplin's death, she had witnessed a duet Joplin sang with [[Tina Turner]] during the opening act (Ike and Tina Turner) for a [[Rolling Stones]] concert at the Garden on [[Thanksgiving Day]]. Friedman said Joplin was "so drunk, so stoned, so out of control, that she could have been an institutionalized psychotic rent by mania."<ref name="buried" /> An audio recording of the duet exists online.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ike & Tina Turner w/ Janis Joplin: "Land of a Thousand Dances" (Madison Square Garden, 11/27/1969) | date=May 27, 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc_DX3QTq_I&t=99 |url-status=live |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=May 30, 2023 |archive-date=May 30, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230530133925/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc_DX3QTq_I&t=99 }}</ref> During another Garden concert where she had solo billing on December 19, some observers believed Joplin tried to incite the audience to riot.<ref name="buried" /> For part of this concert she was joined onstage by [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Paul Butterfield]].

Released in September 1969, the ''Kozmic Blues'' album was certified gold later that year but did not match the success of ''Cheap Thrills''.<ref name="craig" /> Reviews of the new group were mixed. Some music critics, including [[Ralph J. Gleason]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', were negative. Gleason wrote that the new band was a "drag" and Joplin should "scrap" her new band and "go right back to being a member of Big Brother ... (if they'll have her)."<ref name="scars" /> Other reviewers, such as reporter [[Carl Bernstein]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', devoted entire articles to celebrating the singer's magic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ghostsofdc.org/2012/04/18/janis-joplin-plays-merriweather-three-weeks-before-woodstock/ |title=Janis Joplin Plays Merriweather Three Weeks Before Woodstock |author=Tom |date=April 18, 2012 |website=Ghosts of DC |language=en-US |access-date=February 19, 2019 |archive-date=February 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220002923/https://ghostsofdc.org/2012/04/18/janis-joplin-plays-merriweather-three-weeks-before-woodstock/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Bernstein's review said that Joplin "has finally assembled a group of first-rate musicians with whom she is totally at ease and whose abilities complement the incredible range of her voice."<ref>{{cite news |title=Janis – All Together |last=Bernstein |first=Carl |date=July 26, 1969 |newspaper=The Washington Post and Times-Herald |page=E1}}</ref> Columbia Records released "[[Kozmic Blues]]" as a single, which peaked at number 41 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and a live rendition of "Raise Your Hand" was released in Germany and became a top ten hit there.

====January–July 1970====
At the time of the June 1970 interview with Dalton, she had already performed in the Bay Area for what turned out to be the last time. Sam Andrew, the lead guitarist who had left Big Brother with Joplin in December 1968 to form her back-up band, quit in late summer 1969 and returned to Big Brother. At the end of the year, the Kozmic Blues Band broke up. Their final gig with Joplin was the one at Madison Square Garden with Winter and Butterfield.<ref name="scars" /><ref name="dalton">{{Cite book |title=Piece Of My Heart |first=David |last=Dalton |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-306-80446-5}}</ref> In February 1970, Joplin traveled to [[Brazil]], where she stopped her drug and alcohol use. She was accompanied on vacation there by her friend Linda Gravenites (wife of songwriter Nick Gravenites), who had designed Janis's stage costumes from 1967 to 1969. In Brazil, Joplin was romanced by a fellow American tourist named David (George) Niehaus, who was traveling around the world.<ref name="Joplin, Laura" /> Niehaus and Joplin were photographed by the press at [[Rio Carnival]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name="dalton" /> Gravenites also took color photographs of the two during their Brazilian vacation. According to Joplin biographer Ellis Amburn, in Gravenites' snapshots they "look like a carefree, happy, healthy young couple having a tremendously good time."<ref name="amburn" />

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interviewed Joplin during an international phone call, quoting her: "I'm going into the jungle with a big bear of a beatnik named David Niehaus. I finally remembered I don't have to be on stage twelve months a year. I've decided to go and dig some other jungles for a couple of weeks."<ref name="amburn" /> Amburn added in 1992, "Janis was trying to kick heroin in Brazil, and one of the nicest things about David was that he wasn't into drugs."<ref name="amburn" /> When Joplin returned to the U.S., she began using heroin again. Her relationship with Niehaus soon ended because he witnessed her shooting drugs at her new home in [[Larkspur, California]]. The relationship was also complicated by her ongoing romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta, who also was an intravenous addict, and Joplin's refusal to take some time off and travel the world with him.<ref name="amburn" /><ref name="Garvin, Glenn" /> Prior to beginning a summer tour with a newly formed band, she performed in final appearances with Big Brother in a reunion at the [[Fillmore West]], in San Francisco, on April 4, 1970. Recordings from this concert were included on ''[[In Concert (Janis Joplin album)|Joplin in Concert]]'' released posthumously in 1972. She again appeared with Big Brother on April 12 at [[Winterland]], where she and Big Brother were reported to be in excellent form.<ref name="amburn" />

Around this time, she formed her new band, known for a short time as Main Squeeze, then renamed the [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]].<ref name="scars" /><ref name="amburn" /><ref name="buried" /> The band comprised mostly young Canadian musicians previously associated with [[Ronnie Hawkins]] and featured an organ, but no horn section. Joplin took a more active role in putting together the Full Tilt Boogie band than she had with her prior group. She was quoted as saying, "It's ''my'' band. Finally it's ''my'' band!"<ref name="scars" /> In May 1970, after performing under the name Main Squeeze at a [[Hells Angels]] event, the renamed Full Tilt Boogie Band began a nationwide tour. Joplin became very happy with her new group, which eventually received mostly positive feedback from both her fans and the critics.<ref name="scars" /> She performed with the band, billed as Main Squeeze, at a party for the [[Hells Angels]] at a venue in [[San Rafael, California]] on May 21, 1970, according to a web site maintained by Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew.<ref name="samandrew">{{cite web |url=http://samandrew.com/big-brother-history-part-six-1969-to-1972/ |title=Big Brother history, part six, 1969 to 1972 |first=Sam |last=Andrew |date=May 9, 2012 |website=samandrew.com |access-date=April 16, 2020 |archive-date=May 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200517073440/http://samandrew.com/big-brother-history-part-six-1969-to-1972/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Andrew's web site quotes him as saying, "This will be the first time that Janis' old band and her new band will be at the same venue, so everyone is a little on edge."<ref name="samandrew" />

According to Joplin's biographer Ellis Amburn, Big Brother with its lead singer Nick Gravenites was the opening act at the party that was attended by 2,300 people.<ref name="amburn" /> The Hells Angels, who had known Joplin since 1966, paid her a fee of $240 to perform.<ref name="amburn" /> Gravenites and Sam Andrew (who had resumed playing guitar with Big Brother) differed in their opinions of her performance and how substance abuse affected it.<ref name="amburn" /> Gravenites described her singing as "stupendous", according to Amburn.<ref name="amburn" /> Amburn quoted Andrew twenty years later: "She was visibly deteriorating and she looked bloated. She was like a parody of what she was at her best. I put it down to her drinking too much and I felt a tinge of fear for her well-being. Her singing was real flabby, no edge at all."<ref name="amburn" /> Shortly thereafter, Joplin began wearing multi-colored feather boas in her hair. (She had not worn them at the May 21 Hells Angels party/<wbr>concert in San Rafael).<ref name="samandrew" /> By the time she began touring with Full Tilt Boogie, Joplin told people she was drug-free, but her drinking increased.<ref name="amburn" />

From June 28 to July 4, 1970, during the Festival Express tour, Joplin and Full Tilt Boogie performed alongside [[Buddy Guy]], [[The Band]], the [[Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Ten Years After]], the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Delaney & Bonnie]], [[Eric Andersen]], and [[Ian & Sylvia]].<ref name="amburn" /> They played concerts in [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]], and [[Calgary]].<ref name="amburn" /><ref name="dalton" /> Footage of her performance of "Tell Mama" in Calgary became an [[MTV]] video in the early 1980s. Among Joplin's last public appearances were two broadcasts of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. In her June 25, 1970, appearance, she announced that she would attend her ten-year high school class reunion. When asked if she had been popular in school, she admitted that when in high school, her schoolmates "laughed me out of class, out of town and out of the state".<ref name="cavett-janisinterview">{{Cite episode |title=Dick Cavett TV Interview (1970) |series=[[The Dick Cavett Show]] |air-date=August 3, 1970}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/joplin.htm |title=Janis Joplin: A Cry Cutting Through Time |first=Paul |last=Hendrickson |date=May 5, 1998 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=August 22, 2017 |archive-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621160450/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/joplin.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> On July 11, 1970, Full Tilt Boogie and Big Brother and the Holding Company both performed at the same concert in the San Diego Sports Arena,<ref name="Joplin's Shooting Star">{{cite web |url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/tag/san-diego-july-1970/ |title=Joplin's Shooting Star |first=Jack |last=Doyle |date=December 7, 2009 |website=The Pop History Dig |access-date=May 27, 2018 |archive-date=July 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704054559/http://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/tag/san-diego-july-1970/ |url-status=live }}</ref> which was decades later renamed the [[Valley View Casino Center]].

Both Peggy Caserta, Joplin's close friend, and [[Seth Morgan (novelist)|Seth Morgan]], Joplin's fiancé, failed to meet Joplin on Oct. 2, the Friday immediately before her death; Joplin had been expecting both of them to keep her company that night. According to Caserta, Joplin was saddened neither of her friends came to the Landmark as promised.<ref name="amburn" /><ref name="caserta" /> During the 24 hours Joplin lived after this disappointment, Caserta did not call to explain why she failed to show up.<ref name="caserta" /> Caserta admitted to waiting until late Saturday night to dial the Landmark Motel [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]], only to learn that Joplin had instructed the desk clerk not to accept any incoming calls for her after midnight.<ref name="caserta" /> Morgan did speak to Joplin via telephone within the 24 hours before her death, but little is known about that call.<ref name="amburn" /> She used a phone at Sunset Sound Recorders where her colleagues ("there were perhaps twenty to twenty-five people present," wrote biographer Myra Friedman)<ref name="buried" /> noticed that whatever Morgan said to her made her very angry.<ref name="buried" /><ref name="amburn" />

Peggy Caserta has insisted Joplin's death was not an accidental overdose, but rather a result of a head gash suffered after the "hourglass heel" of her slingback sandal caught in the shag carpet, causing her to lose her balance.

Caserta did not see nor communicate by phone with Joplin again, although she later claimed she had tried to reach Joplin at the Landmark Motor Hotel and Sunset Sound Recorders. Caserta and Morgan lost touch with each other; each had independently made plans for Friday, October 2.

<blockquote>Given the near-infinite potentials of infancy, it is really impossible to make generalizations about what lies behind sexual practices. This, however, is probable: to become clearly [[homosexual]], to make the choice that one honestly prefers relations with one's own sex, no matter the origins of such preference, requires a certain integration, a stability of psychic development, a tidiness of personality organization. The ridicule and the humiliation that took place at that most delicate period in [Joplin's] early teens, her own inability to surmount the obstacles to regular growth, devastated her a great deal more than most people comprehended. Janis was not heir to an ego so cohesive as to permit her an identity one way or the other. She was, as [the psychiatric social worker she saw regularly in [[Beaumont, Texas]] in 1965 and 1966] Mr. [Bernard] Giarritano put it [in an interview with Friedman], "diffused" -- spewing, splattering, splaying all over, without a center to hold. That had as much to do with her original use of drugs [before she first met Giarritano] as did the critical component of guilt and its multiplicity of sources above and beyond the contribution made by her relationships with women. Were she so simple as the lesbians wished her to be or so free as her associates imagined!<ref name="buried" /></blockquote>

[[Kim France]] reported in her May 2, 1999, ''[[The New York Times]]'' article, "Nothin' Left to Lose": "Once she became famous, Joplin cursed like a [[truck driver]], did not believe in wearing undergarments, was rarely seen without her bottle of [[Southern Comfort]] and delighted in playing the role of [[sexual predator]]."<ref>{{cite news |first=Kim |last=France |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/02/reviews/990502.02francet.html |date=May 2, 1999 |title=Nothin' Left to Lose: Janis Joplin proved that a female rocker could self-destruct as quickly as a man |work=The New York Times |access-date=August 6, 2016 |archive-date=February 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215135010/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/02/reviews/990502.02francet.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On July 11, 1970, Joplin made a revealing statement about her sexuality to her friend Richard Hundgen, the [[Grateful Dead]]'s San Francisco-based road manager, whom she had known since 1966. When Joplin and Hundgen were offstage during a San Diego gig for both Full Tilt Boogie and Big Brother and the Holding Company, she said the following that he later repeated to Myra Friedman:<ref name="buried" />

<blockquote>I hear a rumor that somebody in San Francisco is spreading stories that I'm a [[dyke (slang)|dyke]].

Joplin's [[body art]], with a wristlet and a small heart on her left breast by the San Francisco tattoo artist [[Lyle Tuttle]], marked an early moment in the popular culture's acceptance of tattoos as art.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Deb |last=Acord |title=Who knew: Mommy has a tattoo |newspaper=[[Portland Press Herald]] |date=November 10, 2006}}</ref> Another trademark was her flamboyant hair styles, which often included colored streaks and accessories such as scarves, beads and feathers.

==Legacy==
===Legacy in the 1970s===
Joplin's death in October 1970 at age 27 stunned her fans and shocked the music world, especially when coupled with the deaths of [[Canned Heat]] singer [[Alan Wilson (musician)|Alan Wilson]] a month earlier, and rock icon [[Jimi Hendrix]] 16 days earlier, both aged 27. All three musicians performed at the two biggest rock festivals of the 1960s: [[Monterey International Pop Festival|Monterey Pop Festival]] and [[Woodstock]]. (This would later cause some people to attribute significance to the death of musicians at the age of 27, as celebrated in the "[[27 Club]]".) Music historian Tom Moon wrote that Joplin had "a devastatingly original voice", music columnist [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Joplin as an artist was "overpowering and deeply vulnerable" and author [[Megan Terry]] said that Joplin was the female version of [[Elvis Presley]] in her ability to captivate an audience.<ref name="Joplin's Shooting Star" /> Joplin was noted for her powerful [[mezzo-soprano]] vocals with a distinctive rock and roll rasping vocal quality, as well as her "electric" stage presence.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/janis-joplin/biography |title=Janis Joplin Biography |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Mark |last=Kemp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220092845/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/janis-joplin/biography |archive-date=February 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Janis-Joplin |title=Janis Joplin |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |first=Gillian G. |last=Gaar |date=February 9, 2000 |access-date=May 8, 2016 |archive-date=March 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324073936/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Janis-Joplin |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://rockhall.com/exhibits/featured-collections/janis-joplin/ |title=Janis Joplin Collection |work=[[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312055213/https://rockhall.com/exhibits/featured-collections/janis-joplin/ |archive-date=March 12, 2012}}</ref> Her most popular songs include her cover versions of "[[Piece of My Heart]]", "[[Cry Baby (Garnet Mimms song)|Cry Baby]]", "[[Down on Me (traditional song)|Down on Me]]", "[[Ball and Chain (Big Mama Thornton song)|Ball and Chain]]", and "[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]", as well as her original song "[[Mercedes Benz (song)|Mercedes Benz]]", which was her final recording.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/the-10-best-janis-joplin-songs/mercedes-benz/ |date=September 23, 2015 |title=The 10 best Janis Joplin songs |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=April 5, 2018 |archive-date=June 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621044737/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/the-10-best-janis-joplin-songs/mercedes-benz/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/janis-joplin-songs/ |title=Top 10 Janis Joplin Songs |first=Michael |last=Gallucci |work=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=January 19, 2013 |access-date=May 8, 2016 |archive-date=May 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504175446/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/janis-joplin-songs/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

A book about Joplin by her publicist Myra Friedman titled ''Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin'' (1973)<ref>{{cite book |title=Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin |first=Myra |last=Friedman |date=1974 |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/buried-alive-myra-friedman/1100620841 |isbn=978-0-6880-0160-5 |publisher=HarperCollins |access-date=August 4, 2016 |archive-date=August 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806105632/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/buried-alive-myra-friedman/1100620841 |url-status=live }}</ref> was excerpted in many newspapers. At the same time, Peggy Caserta's memoir, ''Going Down With Janis'' (1973),<ref>{{cite book |title=Going down with Janis |last1=Caserta |first1=Peggy |author-link1=Peggy Caserta |last2=Knapp |first2=Dan |date=1974 |isbn=978-0-4401-3194-6 |publisher=Random House |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/going-down-with-janis-peggy-caserta/1018324813?ean=9780440131946 |access-date=August 4, 2016 |archive-date=August 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806112811/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/going-down-with-janis-peggy-caserta/1018324813?ean=9780440131946 |url-status=live }}</ref> attracted much attention; its provocative title is a reference to Caserta's claim that she had engaged in oral sex with Joplin while they were high on heroin in September 1970. The description provided by Dan Knapp, Caserta's co-author whom she denounced decades later,<ref name="vulture.com" /><ref name="The redemption of Peggy Caserta" /> repelled many people in 1973 when few books or filmed interviews of Joplin or her loved ones were accessible to the public. Joplin's bandmate [[Sam Andrew]] described Caserta as "halfway between a [[groupie]] and a friend" in an interview with writer [[Ellis Amburn]].<ref name="amburn" /> Soon after the 1973 publication of ''Going Down With Janis'', Joplin's friends learned that graphic descriptions of sexual acts and intravenous drug use were not the only portions of the book that would haunt them.

According to Kim Chappell, a close friend of Caserta and Joplin, Caserta's book angered the Los Angeles heroin dealer whom she had described in detail in her book, including the make and model of his car.<ref name="amburn" /> According to Amburn, in 1973, a "carful of dope dealers" visited a Los Angeles lesbian bar that Caserta had been frequenting.<ref name="amburn" /> Chappell, who was in the alley behind the bar, stated: "I was stabbed because, when Peggy's book came out, her dealer, the same one who'd given Janis her last fix, didn't like it that he was referred to and was out to get Peggy. He couldn't find her, so he went for her lover. When they realized who I was, they felt that my death would also hit Peggy, and so they stabbed me."<ref name="amburn" /> Despite being "stabbed three times in the chest, puncturing both lungs," Chappell eventually recovered.<ref name="amburn" />

According to Joplin's biographers, Caserta was among many friends of Joplin who did not become clean and sober until a long time after Joplin's death, while others died from overdoses.<ref name="The redemption of Peggy Caserta" /><ref name="vulture.com" /><ref name="scars" /><ref name="buried" /> Although the wife of Big Brother guitarist James Gurley, who was Joplin's close friend, died from a heroin overdose in 1969, devastating Joplin,<ref name="amburn" /> Gurley himself did not become clean and sober until 1984.<ref name="amburn" /> Caserta survived "a near-fatal OD in December 1995", wrote [[Alice Echols]].<ref name="scars" /> On January 13, 2000, Caserta appeared during a segment about Joplin on ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]''.<ref>{{YouTube|xyTESUQWfV0|20/20 segment entitled "Downtown" originally broadcast on the ABC network on January 13, 2000}}</ref> In 2018, Caserta denounced ''Going Down With Janis'' as the pornographic fantasy of Dan Knapp, her co-author, and largely unreliable. During that year, the public had its first access to her own story via a memoir she co-wrote with Maggie Falcon titled ''I Ran into Some Trouble''.  It describes a long, friendly relationship with Joplin that only occasionally featured sexuality.<ref name="vulture.com" /><ref name="The redemption of Peggy Caserta" /><ref name="978-1-948018-08-1">{{cite book |last1=Caserta |first1=Peggy |author-link1=Peggy Caserta |last2=Falcon |first2=Maggie |title=I Ran Into Some Trouble |date=August 8, 2018 |publisher=Wyatt-MacKenzie Publishing |isbn=978-1-948018-08-1 |language=en}}</ref>

A [[Serge Gainsbourg]]-penned French language song by English singer [[Jane Birkin]], "Ex fan des sixties" (1978), references Joplin along with other disappeared "idols", such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Brian Jones]] and [[Marc Bolan]]. When Joplin was alive, [[Country Joe McDonald]] released a song called "Janis" on his band's album ''[[I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die]]'' (1967). In her memoir ''[[Just Kids]]'', [[Patti Smith]] mentions writing a song for Joplin and singing it to her one night at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]], where both were living at the time. The song, called "Lullaby (I Was Working Real Hard)", was never recorded by Joplin but eventually appeared on Smith's Live At The Bottom Line, a performance from 1975.

The film ''[[The Rose (film)|The Rose]]'' (1979) is loosely based on Joplin's life. Originally planned to be titled ''Pearl''—Joplin's nickname and the title of her last album—the film was fictionalized after her family declined to allow the producers the rights to her story.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |first=Priya |last=Elan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/aug/07/janis-joplin-biopic |title=Is the Janis Joplin biopic finally going to be filmed?
