'''Bryan Ferry''' (born 26 September 1945) is an English singer and songwriter. He became known as the frontman of the band [[Roxy Music]] and also launched a solo career. 

Born to a working-class family, Ferry studied fine art and taught at a secondary school before pursuing a career in music. In 1970 he began to assemble Roxy Music with a group of friends and acquaintances in London, and took the role of lead singer and main songwriter. The band achieved immediate international success with the release of [[Roxy Music (album)|their self-titled debut album]] in 1972, containing a rich multitude of sounds, which reflected Ferry's interest in exploring different genres of music. Their second album, ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'' (1973), further cultivated the band's unique sound and visual image that would establish Ferry as a leading cultural icon over the next decade.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/bryan-ferry-the-life-and-loves-of-a-music-icon-30299362.html|title=Bryan Ferry: The life and loves of a music icon|newspaper=Belfasttelegraph|via=www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

Ferry began a parallel solo career by releasing ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'' (1973), which popularized the concept of a contemporary musician releasing an album covering [[traditional pop|standard songs]] and was a drastic departure from his ongoing work with Roxy Music. This was followed by a second album, ''[[Another Time, Another Place (Bryan Ferry album)|Another Time, Another Place]]'' (1974). Roxy Music released a trilogy of albums, ''[[Stranded (album)|Stranded]]'' (1973), ''[[Country Life (Roxy Music album)|Country Life]]'' (1974) and ''[[Siren (Roxy Music album)|Siren]]'' (1975), which broadened the band's appeal internationally and saw Ferry take greater interest in the role of a live performer, reinventing himself in stage costumes ranging from [[gaucho]] to military uniforms. In 1983, following the release of their best-selling album ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' the previous year, Ferry disbanded Roxy Music to concentrate on his solo career, with his next album, 1985's ''[[Boys and Girls (album)|Boys and Girls]]'', reaching No. 1 in the UK and featuring the hit singles "[[Slave to Love]]" and "[[Don't Stop the Dance]]", while the next two albums ''[[Bête Noire (album)|Bête Noire]]'' (1987) and ''[[Taxi (Bryan Ferry album)|Taxi]]'' (1993) both went Top 10 in the UK.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|title=BRYAN FERRY {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14894/bryan-ferry/|access-date=29 July 2021|website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref>

As well as being a prolific songwriter, Ferry has recorded many cover versions, including standards from the [[Great American Songbook]], and ''[[Dylanesque]]'' (2007), an album of [[Bob Dylan]] covers. Including his work with Roxy Music, Ferry has sold over 30 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bryan Ferry Signs Worldwide Partnership Deal with BMG Chrysalis U.K. |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bryan-ferry-signs-worldwide-partnership-384735 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=31 October 2012 |access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> In 2019, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Roxy Music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roxy Music |url=https://www.rockhall.com/2019-inductees/roxy-music |publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |year=2019 |access-date=13 December 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
===Roxy Music (1970–1983)===
{{Main|Roxy Music}}
[[File:Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music) - TopPop 1973 2 (crop).png|thumb|Ferry performing with Roxy Music on Dutch television in 1973]]Ferry formed Roxy Music with a group of friends and acquaintances, beginning with bassist Graham Simpson, an art school classmate, in November 1970. The line-up was expanded to include saxophonist/oboist [[Andy Mackay]] and [[Brian Eno]], an acquaintance who owned tape recorders and played Mackay's synthesiser. Other early members included timpanist Dexter Lloyd and ex-[[The Nice|Nice]] guitarist [[David O'List]], though by the time the band recorded [[Roxy Music (album)|their first album]], the line-up had settled as Ferry, Simpson, Mackay, Eno, drummer [[Paul Thompson (musician)|Paul Thompson]] and guitarist [[Phil Manzanera]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2004_279.shtml|title= Getting Roxy Music in with 'The 'In' Crowd' – An Interview With Davy O'List|website=VivaRoxyMusic.com|date= 25 April 2004|access-date=15 June 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070515142126/http://vivaroxymusic.com/reviews_2004_279.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 15 May 2007}}</ref> Around late 1970/early 1971, Ferry auditioned for [[King Crimson]], who were seeking a new singer and bassist to replace [[Gordon Haskell]]. Although his voice was deemed not right for Crimson, band members [[Robert Fripp]] and [[Peter Sinfield]] were still impressed with Ferry and quickly developed a friendship with him that would lead to Roxy Music being signed to Crimson's management company [[E.G. Records|E.G.]] and Sinfield producing their first album and its subsequent non-album single "[[Virginia Plain]]".

Released on 16 June 1972, Roxy Music's self-titled debut album reached no. 10 on the UK album charts and immediately established the band's presence in the British music scene.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=ROXY MUSIC {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14677/roxy-music/ |access-date=2022-04-17 |website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref> By the time the album was released Simpson had departed and the band would undergo several changes of bassist for the next few years. Later that summer the band appeared on the television show  ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' for the first time, performing their first hit single, "Virginia Plain", marking one of the first electronic music performances on a mainstream television show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/roxy-music-virginia-plain-top-of-the-pops-video-1972/|title = Roxy Music play 'Virginia Plain' on Top of the Pops, 1972|date = 11 March 2020}}</ref> The first two Roxy Music albums were written solely by Ferry; the debut contained a pastiche of musical styles, representing Ferry's wide-ranging interests, while the second album, ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'' (1973), pursued a darker, more determined mood.

Ferry met women's fashion designer [[Antony Price]] at a party in Holland Park in 1972, and later that year enlisted him alongside other friends including Nick de Ville to create the cover for Roxy Music's debut album. Featuring model Kari-Ann Moller splayed on the floor in a dress designed by Price, the cover image captivated the attention of the general public and according to writer Richard Williams was, "nothing less than a challenge, bold and direct, to the prevailing complacency."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moredarkthanshark.org/eno_int_quiet-feb18.html|title=Brian Eno is MORE DARK THAN SHARK|website=Moredarkthanshark.org}}</ref> Ferry would continue art-directing each Roxy Music album cover to follow.

Ferry began a parallel solo career in 1973, performing cover versions of old standards on his debut studio album ''[[These Foolish Things (album)|These Foolish Things]]'' (1973) and his second album ''[[Another Time, Another Place (Bryan Ferry album)|Another Time, Another Place]]'' (1974), both of which reached the UK top 5.<ref name=":2" /> The latter featured on its cover an image of Ferry posing by a pool in a white dinner jacket, a persona which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' dubbed "dandy of the bizarre".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bryan-ferry-dandy-of-the-bizarre-2-120616/|title=Bryan Ferry: Dandy of the Bizarre|first1=Charles|last1=Nicholl|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=24 April 1975}}</ref> Ferry's interest in the Great American Songbook represented a stark departure from Roxy Music, and the success of these two albums created a template which would be followed later by other artists including [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name="note1"/> Embarking on his first solo tour in support of these albums, in 1973 Ferry was notably denied his request for a show at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] due to a ban on rock concerts before ultimately being granted his first performance a year later, in December 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.royalalberthall.com/about-the-hall/news/2015/may/unearthed-letters-reveal-that-bryan-ferrys-planned-royal-albert-hall-debut-was-blocked/ |title=Unearthed letters reveal that Bryan Ferry's planned Royal Albert Hall debut was blocked |publisher=Royal Albert Hall |last=Griffin |first=Matt |date=29 May 2015 |access-date=20 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231004094229/https://www.royalalberthall.com/about-the-hall/news/2015/may/unearthed-letters-reveal-that-bryan-ferrys-planned-royal-albert-hall-debut-was-blocked/|archive-date=2023-10-04}}</ref> Ferry's debut at the Royal Albert Hall was recorded and later released as ''Live at the Royal Albert Hall, 1974'' in 2020. Contemporary reviews of this period of Ferry's live performances noted his "actor's instinct for understatement" and praised his novelty and command on stage, concluding "to be Bryan Ferry in 1974 was like being Bob Dylan in 1965, [[Clark Gable]] in 1939, and [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1895."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bryan-ferry-live-at-the-royal-albert-hall-1974/|title=Bryan Ferry: Live at the Royal Albert Hall 1974|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>

{{blockquote|text=Roxy Music changed the face and curves, the visage and physique, of rock and pop. From their definitively art-school debut album of 1972, the collision of past and future of which still startles, through the Gatsby sighs of Ferry's gondolas, glam and goddesses period, then the two-year split, then the return with the likes of ''Manifesto'' and ''Avalon'' (so improbably refined that they shouldn't exist, can't exist, but do), Roxy were the ultimate marriage of style and substance: inspiring, influential, intoxicating.|sign=Chris Roberts, "Olympian Heights: Bryan Ferry Talks to Chris Roberts", ''[[The Quietus]]'' (18 November 2010).<ref name="Roberts">{{cite news |url=https://thequietus.com/articles/05305-bryan-ferry-roxy-music-interview |title=Olympian Heights: Bryan Ferry Talks To Chris Roberts |last=Roberts |first=Chris |work=[[The Quietus]] |location=London |date=18 November 2010 |access-date=30 April 2022}}</ref>}}

Between 1972 and 1974, Ferry's creative output was prolific, as he released a total of six studio albums between his solo career and Roxy Music. The third Roxy Music album, ''[[Stranded (album)|Stranded]]'' (1973), saw the departure of Brian Eno and the recruitment by Ferry of violinist and keyboardist [[Eddie Jobson]], a contributor to Ferry's first solo album. ''Stranded'' became Roxy Music's first UK no. 1 album, dominating the charts for four months, and its supporting world tour saw Ferry wear a white dinner jacket and move out from behind the keyboard to take centre stage. The Rake notes, "the suit became the lynchpin of his onstage persona, buoyed by iconic, ostentatious tailoring by the likes of Anthony Price."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://therake.com/stories/icons/thrill-bryan-ferry/ | title=The Thrill of It All: Bryan Ferry &#124; the Rake|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231004093940/https://therake.com/stories/icons/thrill-bryan-ferry/|archive-date=2023-10-04 }}</ref> After the concert tour in support of their fifth studio album, ''[[Siren (Roxy Music album)|Siren]]'' (1975), Roxy Music temporarily disbanded in 1976, though some Roxy members - Paul Thompson, Phil Manzanera, Eddie Jobson and bassists [[John Gustafson (musician)|John Gustafson]], [[John Wetton]] and [[Rick Wills]] - took part in the recording of Ferry's subsequent solo material. He released three solo albums during this period, ''[[Let's Stick Together]]'' (1976), ''[[In Your Mind (album)|In Your Mind]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare (album)|The Bride Stripped Bare]]'' (1978), all of which charted in the UK top 20.<ref name=":2" />

Disappointed by the lukewarm response to ''The Bride Stripped Bare'', Ferry reformed Roxy Music at the end of 1978 to record tracks for what would become their sixth studio album, ''[[Manifesto (Roxy Music album)|Manifesto]]'', which was released in early 1979 and reached no. 7 in the UK album charts.<ref name=":3" /> By now, Roxy Music was a core quartet of Ferry, Mackay, Thompson and Manzanera, and then a core trio following Thompson's departure at the end of 1979, augmented by a wide array of other musicians in the studio and on stage, some drawn from Ferry's solo output. 1980's ''[[Flesh and Blood (Roxy Music album)|Flesh + Blood]]'' album reached no. 1 in the UK album charts, two years before the group's final studio release ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' in 1982, which also reached no. 1 in the UK album charts.<ref name=":3" /> In-between these two albums, the band also achieved their first and only UK no. 1 single, "[[Jealous Guy]]", released in 1981 as a posthumous tribute to its author, [[John Lennon]], who had been [[Murder of John Lennon|murdered two months earlier]].<ref name=":3" /> It was the only one of their singles not to be written or co-written by Ferry. After lengthy tours to promote the ''[[Avalon (Roxy Music album)|Avalon]]'' album, Ferry disbanded Roxy Music in 1983 and continued as a solo artist.

===Solo years (1984–2001)===
Resuming his solo career, Ferry's sixth solo album, ''[[Boys and Girls (album)|Boys and Girls]]'', reached no. 1 in the UK in June 1985, and was his first and only solo studio album to top the chart.<ref name=":2" /> ''Boys and Girls'' remained in the UK chart for 44 weeks and its lead single, "[[Slave to Love]]", reached the UK top ten.<ref>{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums|year=2006|page=198|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=978-1904994107}}</ref> In July 1985, Ferry performed at the London [[Live Aid]] show, accompanied by [[Pink Floyd]] guitarist [[David Gilmour]].<ref>{{cite news

After the ''Avalon'' promotional tours, Ferry was reluctant to return to touring; a change of management persuaded him to resume touring in 1988 to promote the previous year's ''[[Bête Noire (album)|Bête Noire]]''. Following the tour, Ferry teamed again with Brian Eno for ''[[Mamouna]]'' (collaborating with [[Robin Trower]] on guitar and as producer). The album took more than five years to produce, and was created under the working title ''Horoscope''. During production, Ferry simultaneously recorded and released a covers album, ''[[Taxi (Bryan Ferry album)|Taxi]]'', in 1993, his eighth solo studio album, which peaked at no. 2 on the UK charts.<ref name=":2" /> ''Mamouna'' (Ferry's ninth solo studio album) was released in 1994, peaking at no. 11 on the UK charts.<ref name=":2" /> In 1996, Ferry performed the song "Dance with Life" for the ''[[Phenomenon (film)|Phenomenon]]'' soundtrack, written by [[Bernie Taupin]] and [[Martin Page]].

In 1999, Ferry released his tenth solo studio album, ''[[As Time Goes By (Bryan Ferry album)|As Time Goes By]]'', consisting of cover versions of 1930s songs. The album peaked at no. 16 in the UK charts and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=As time goes by {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/as%20time%20goes%20by/ |access-date=2022-04-19 |website=Officialcharts.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=43rd Annual GRAMMY Awards |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/bryan-ferry/3332 |access-date=2022-04-19 |website=Grammy.com}}</ref>

===Roxy Music reunion (2001–2011)===
Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson re-reformed Roxy Music in 2001 and toured extensively for a couple of years, though the band did not record any new material. In 2002, Ferry released a new studio album, ''[[Frantic (album)|Frantic]]'', which featured several tracks written with [[David A.

In June 2011, Ferry was made a [[CBE]] in the Queen's Birthday Honours for his contribution to the British music industry, and in 2012 he was awarded the French national honour of [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Bruce Forsyth knighthood heads Queen's Birthday Honours |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13728375 |publisher=BBC News |date=11 June 2011}}</ref> In 2014, Ferry was made an honorary [[Doctor of Music]] by Newcastle University.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/488338/Bryan-Ferry-Doctor-of-Music-Newcastle-University|title=Roxy Music's Bryan Ferry receives honorary degree from Newcastle University|date=12 July 2014|website=[[Daily Express]]|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref>

On 26 November 2012, Ferry released a new album entitled ''[[The Jazz Age (The Bryan Ferry Orchestra album)|The Jazz Age]]'' with [[the Bryan Ferry Orchestra]]. The album features 1920s period jazz renditions of some of Ferry's songs (from both his solo discography and with Roxy Music). Film director [[Baz Luhrmann]] asked to use Ferry's song "Love Is the Drug" from ''The Jazz Age'' album for the 2013 film ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]''. This resulted in a collaboration with the Bryan Ferry Orchestra to create several jazz pieces throughout the movie, released as a separate album titled ''The Great Gatsby – The Jazz Recordings (A Selection of Yellow Cocktail Music)''. Ferry began touring with the Bryan Ferry Orchestra in 2013, including a performance at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] which was opened by Luhrmann's ''Great Gatsby'' film.

In 2014, Ferry toured extensively, with notable performances including [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], as well as an appearance at the [[Chicago Theatre]], which was preceded by a talk with author [[Michael Bracewell (writer)|Michael Bracewell]] at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] on the subjects of fame and his creative inspiration.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Rutherford|first=Kevin|date=20 January 2014|title=Bryan Ferry Reveals Eight-Date Tour Around Coachella|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5876991/bryan-ferry-reveals-eight-date-tour-around-coachella/|access-date=22 January 2021|magazine=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Josh|date=22 September 2014|title=As always, Bryan Ferry was impeccable|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-bryan-ferry-review-chicago-theatre-roxy-music-20140922-story.html|access-date=22 January 2021|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=MCA Talk: Bryan Ferry and Michael Bracewell |url=https://mcachicago.org/Calendar/2014/09/Bryan-Ferry-And-Michael-Bracewell |work=MCA |access-date=18 August 2018}}</ref> Also in 2014, Ferry collaborated with the Norwegian DJ/producer [[Todd Terje]], providing vocals on a cover version of "[[Johnny and Mary]]" (originally recorded by [[Robert Palmer]]).

In November 2014, Ferry released a new album entitled ''[[Avonmore (Bryan Ferry album)|Avonmore]]'', featuring original material and two cover songs (including the aforementioned "Johnny and Mary" with Terje). To support the album, Ferry launched a 20-date tour across the UK and released his first-ever solo live album, ''Live 2015''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bryanferry.com/new-bryan-ferry-live-album/|title=New Bryan Ferry Live Album – Bryan Ferry|website=Bryanferry.com|date=15 April 2016 |access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref> Ferry continued to tour Europe and North America in the three years following the album's release, consistently playing no fewer than 30 shows each year.

In his 1976 essay "Them", Peter York described Ferry as "the best possible example of the ultimate art-directed existence" and suggested he was the most important pasticheur in Britain at the time.<ref name="google1"/> Ferry has credited numerous art and film influences throughout his career, among them [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Hamilton is credited by Ferry as an inspiration to him both as an artist and as a person, and is also responsible for introducing Ferry as an art student to Duchamp's work.

Hall and Ferry lived together, sharing homes in London and in the [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] neighbourhood of [[Los Angeles]], and Hall also appeared in some of Ferry's solo music videos, including "[[Let's Stick Together (song)|Let's Stick Together]]" and "The Price of Love" (both 1976).<ref>{{cite news |title=Bryan Ferry: "People like you to be difficult and weird" |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/bryan-ferry-people-like-difficult-weird-103600/2 |work=Uncut Magazine |access-date=18 August 2018}}</ref> Their relationship ended when she left him for [[Mick Jagger]] in late 1977.

Ferry rarely talks about Hall, but fans have often speculated his song "[[Kiss and Tell (Bryan Ferry song)|Kiss and Tell]]" from his album ''[[Bête Noire (album)|Bête Noire]]'' (1987) was his response to Hall's 1985 tell-all book in which she discussed their relationship.<ref>{{cite news |title=Songfacts: Kiss And Tell by Bryan Ferry |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=8268 |work=Songfacts |access-date=10 August 2007}}</ref> Additionally, Ferry's 1978 solo album ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare (album)|The Bride Stripped Bare]]'' is widely believed<ref>{{cite news |last=Myers |first=Stephanie R. |title=Jerry Hall Prefers Rockers Over Brad Pitt |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Jerry-Hall-Prefers-Rockers-Over-Brad-Pitt-7387.shtml |publisher=Softpedia |access-date=10 August 2007}}</ref> to contain allusions to his break-up with Hall, particularly the song "When She Walks in the Room".

===Political views===
In 1988, Ferry referred to himself as "sort of [[Conservatism|conservative]]" in his beliefs in an interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. He also expressed support for having a strong work ethic, stating "most of my life is spent working hard. I come from the kind of working-class background where you have to work very hard and if you don't, you feel guilty."<ref>{{cite web |last=Matre |first=Lynn Van |title=BRYAN FERRY |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-08-26-8801250845-story.html |website=Chicago Tribune |date=26 August 1988 |access-date=13 January 2021}}</ref>

In 2008, Ferry indicated that he supported the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], referring to himself as [[apolitical]] but "conservative by nature", preferring not to mix art with politics. Without elaborating, he stated he was "proud" of his son Otis and described the then [[Second Blair ministry|Labour Government]]'s [[Hunting Act 2004|ban on fox hunting]] as "futile". He also expressed an opposition to "[[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] bitterness" and [[political correctness]], saying both were stifling to individual liberty and freedom of expression. The model of free speech he cited was the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Farndale |first=Nigel |title=Bryan Ferry: 'I don't want to be controversial' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3672494/Bryan-Ferry-I-dont-want-to-be-controversial.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3672494/Bryan-Ferry-I-dont-want-to-be-controversial.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=16 April 2008 |access-date=16 May 2009}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In a 2009 interview, Ferry stated: <blockquote>I would support a [[David Cameron|Cameron]] government.

It was politically motivated. The poor lad just wants to live the traditional country life.<ref name="sanghera"/></blockquote>
