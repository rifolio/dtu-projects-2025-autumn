'''Clyde Jackson Browne''' (born October 9, 1948) is an American rock musician, singer, songwriter, and political activist who has sold over 30 million albums in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database# |publisher=RIAA |access-date=February 21, 2013 |quote=Use advanced search for Artist Name = Browne, Jackson}}</ref>

Emerging as a teenage songwriter in mid-1960s [[Los Angeles]], Jackson Browne had his first successes writing songs for others. He wrote "[[These Days (Jackson Browne song)|These Days]]" as a 16-year-old; the song became a minor hit for the German singer and [[Andy Warhol]] protégé [[Nico]] in 1967. He also wrote several songs for fellow Southern California bands the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] (of which he was briefly a member in 1966) and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], the latter of whom had their first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']] Top 40 hit in 1972 with the Browne co-written song "[[Take It Easy]]".

Jackson Browne lived in a small apartment in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles in the early 1970s. He started writing "Take It Easy" for his first album, but he didn't know how to finish it until his upstairs neighbor Glenn Frey came to visit and was able to help finish it. Browne gave the song to Frey who was able to get it onto the Billboards Top 40 with his new band The Eagles.

Frey, who lived in the apartment above Browne's, recalled hearing Browne's persistent songwriting process, including the sound of his teapot and piano, from which he learned about the creative effort involved in finishing a song.

Encouraged by his successes writing songs for others, Browne released his [[Jackson Browne (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1972, which included two Top 40 hits of his own, "[[Doctor, My Eyes]]" and "[[Rock Me on the Water]]". For his debut album, as well as the next several albums and concert tours, Browne started to work closely with [[The Section (band)|The Section]], a prolific session band which also worked with a number of other prominent singer-songwriters of the era. His second album, ''[[For Everyman]]'', was released in 1973. His third album, ''[[Late for the Sky]]'' (1974), was his most successful to that point, peaking at number 14 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart. His fourth album, ''[[The Pretender (album)|The Pretender]]'' (1976), continued the pattern of each album topping the previous by peaking at number 5 on the album chart, and included the hit singles "[[Here Come Those Tears Again]]" and "[[The Pretender (Jackson Browne song)|The Pretender]]".

Browne's 1977 album ''[[Running on Empty (album)|Running on Empty]]'', however, is his signature work; it rose to number 3 on the album chart and remained there for over a year. Both [[live album|live]] and a [[concept album]], it explores in its songs the themes of life as a touring musician, and the album was recorded both on stage and in places touring musicians spend time when not playing, such as hotel rooms, backstage, and in one case on a moving [[tour bus]]. The album produced two Top 40 singles, "[[Running on Empty (song)|Running on Empty]]" and "[[The Load-Out]]/[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]", and many of the other tracks became popular radio hits on the [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] format.

Browne had successful albums through the 1980s, including the 1980 album ''[[Hold Out]]'', which was his only number 1 album; the non-album single "[[Somebody's Baby]]", which was used in the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', and 1983's ''[[Lawyers in Love]]'', which included the hit single "[[Tender Is the Night (song)|Tender Is the Night]]". In 1986, he released ''[[Lives in the Balance]]'', which had several radio hits and included the introspective "[[In the Shape of a Heart]]", which was inspired by the suicide of his first wife a decade prior. His string of hit albums came to an end at that point, as his next several albums failed to produce a gold or platinum [[RIAA]] rating.

He released two compilation albums, ''[[The Next Voice You Hear: The Best of Jackson Browne]]'' in 1997, and ''[[The Very Best of Jackson Browne]]'', released in conjunction with his [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction in 2004. His most recent studio album is 2021's ''[[Downhill from Everywhere]]'', the follow-up to 2014's ''[[Standing in the Breach]]'', which included the first fully realized version of his song "[[The Birds of St. Marks]]", a song he had written at age 18. In 2015, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked him as 37th in its list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]]".<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-songwriters |title=100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=March 28, 2018}}</ref>

===Early life===
Browne was born October 9, 1948, in [[Heidelberg]], Germany, where his father Clyde Jack Browne, an American serviceman, was stationed for his job assignment with the ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' newspaper. Browne's mother, Beatrice Amanda (née Dahl), was from [[Minnesota]] of Norwegian ancestry.<ref name="jrp-graphics-bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/jbbio.html |title=Jackson Browne – Biography |last=Paris |first=Russ |access-date=May 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102144332/http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/jbbio.html |archive-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref>

He attended [[Sunny Hills High School]] in [[Fullerton, California]], graduating in 1966.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

===Songwriter for others===
After graduating from high school Browne joined the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], performing at the [[Golden Bear (nightclub)|Golden Bear]] in [[Huntington Beach, California]], where they opened for [[the Lovin' Spoonful]]. Later the band recorded a number of Browne's songs, including "These Days", "Holding", and "Shadow Dream Song".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jackson-browne/biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113213909/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jackson-browne/biography |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 13, 2013 |title=Jackson Browne Biography |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=February 17, 2016}}</ref> He was in his friend [[Pamela Polland]]'s band, Gentle Soul for a short time.

He left the Dirt Band after a few months and moved to [[Greenwich Village]], New York, where he became a staff writer for [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]'s publishing company, Nina Music, before he was eighteen. He reported on musical events in [[New York City]] with his friends Greg Copeland and Adam Saylor. For the remainder of 1967 and also 1968 he was in Greenwich Village, where he backed [[Tim Buckley]] and singer [[Nico]] of the [[Velvet Underground]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Luhrssen |first1=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phsIDgAAQBAJ |title=Encyclopedia of Classic Rock |last2=Larson |first2=Michael |date=2017-02-24 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-4408-3514-8 |language=en}}</ref> In 1967, Browne and Nico were romantically linked; he became a significant contributor to her debut album, ''[[Chelsea Girl (album)|Chelsea Girl]]'', writing and playing guitar on several of the songs (including "[[These Days (Jackson Browne song)|These Days]]"). In 1968, following his breakup with Nico, Browne returned to Los Angeles, where he formed a folk band with [[Ned Doheny]] and Jack Wilce. This is when he first met [[Glenn Frey]].

Browne's first songs, such as "Shadow Dream Song" and "These Days", were recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, [[Tom Rush]], Nico, Steve Noonan, [[Gregg Allman]], [[Joan Baez]], the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[the Byrds]], [[Iain Matthews]], and others. Browne did not release his own versions of these early songs until years later. Soon ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' mentioned Browne as a "new face to look for" and praised his "mind-boggling melodies".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Folk You |first=John J. |last=Rock |url=http://archive.rollingstone.com/Desktop?s=196804063#/19680406/8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412123403/http://archive.rollingstone.com/Desktop?s=196804063#/19680406/8 |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 12, 2013 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 8, 2012}}</ref>

===Classic period===
[[File:JacksonBrowne 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Browne during a 1976 concert in [[Hamburg]], Germany]]
In 1971, Browne signed with his manager [[David Geffen]]'s [[Asylum Records]] and released ''[[Jackson Browne (album)|Jackson Browne]]'' (1972)<!-- Please note this album is not called "Saturate Before Using", which is a misapplication of the cover art. See album's page for more information. --> produced and engineered by Richard Orshoff, which included the piano-driven "[[Doctor My Eyes]]", which entered the Top Ten in the [[Billboard Hot 100|US singles chart]]. "[[Rock Me on the Water]]", from the same album, also gained considerable [[FM broadcasting|radio airplay]], while "[[Jamaica Say You Will (song)|Jamaica Say You Will]]" and "[[Song for Adam]]" (written about his friend Adam Saylor's death) helped establish Browne's reputation. Touring to promote the album, he shared the bill with [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Joni Mitchell]].

His next album, ''[[For Everyman]]'' (1973) garnered good reviews but was less successful than his debut, although it still sold a million copies<ref name="TS">{{cite web |url=http://tsort.info/music/x7vrb3.htm |title=Album artist 238 – Jackson Browne |website=Tsort.info |access-date=January 17, 2014}}</ref> and included his version of "[[Take It Easy]]", cowritten with the Eagles' Glenn Frey, which had already been a major success for the group.

''[[Late for the Sky]]'' (1974) consolidated Browne's fan base, and the album peaked at No. 14.<ref name="TS"/><ref>Paris, Russ. [http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/lfts.html Jackson Browne Discography ''Late for the Sky''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420232833/http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/lfts.html |date=April 20, 2012}}</ref> He gained a reputation for memorable melody, insightful, often personal lyrics, and a talent for his arrangements in composition.  The title track was featured in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''[[Taxi Driver]]''. During this period, Browne began his fractious professional relationship with [[Warren Zevon]], producing Zevon's first two Asylum albums. [[File:Jackson Browne-1980.jpg|thumb|upright|Browne in 1980]]
Browne was accompanied on tour by his wife and their infant son. They travelled in a converted [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus.{{sfn|Bego|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TSoOOD-MidAC&pg=PA88 88]}} In 1975, Browne toured variously with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Toots and the Maytals]].<ref>{{cite web |title=A Jackson Browne Concert Chronology |website=The Road & The Sky |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712034127/http://www.ghostsontheroad.co.uk/JB/1975.html |url=http://www.ghostsontheroad.co.uk/JB/1975.html |archive-date=2011-07-12}}</ref>

Browne's next album, ''[[The Pretender (album)|The Pretender]]'', was released in 1976, after his wife's suicide.  A year later, "[[Here Come Those Tears Again]]", co-written with his mother-in-law, Nancy Farnsworth, hit No. 23 on the pop singles chart.  The follow-up album, ''[[Running on Empty (album)|Running on Empty]]'' (1977), recorded entirely on tour, became his biggest commercial success. Breaking the usual conventions for a live album, Browne used only new material and combined live concert performances with recordings made on buses, in hotel rooms, and backstage.<ref>{{cite web |first=William |last=Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/running-on-empty-mw0000193103 |title=Running on Empty – Jackson Browne &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=February 17, 2016}}</ref> ''Running on Empty'' contains some of his most popular songs, including the title track and "[[The Load-Out]]/[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]", Browne's send-off to concert audiences and tribute to his roadies.

===Activism and music===
In spring of 1978, Browne appeared near a nuclear reprocessing plant in [[Barnwell, South Carolina]], to perform a free concert the night before a civil disobedience action; he did not participate in the action. In June 1978 he performed on the grounds of the [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]] construction site in [[New Hampshire]] for 20,000 opponents of the reactor.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wasserman |first=Harvey |url=http://www.nukefree.org/news/jacksonbrowneoncolbert |title=Jackson Browne Nails Nuke Power on Colbert |website=NukeFree.org |year=2008 |access-date=February 17, 2016}}</ref>

Shortly after the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], during March 1979, Browne joined with several musician friends to found the [[anti-nuclear|antinuclear]] organization [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]].<ref name="aol"/> He was arrested while protesting against the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]] near [[San Luis Obispo]]. His next album, ''[[Hold Out]]'' (1980), was commercially successful and his only number 1 record on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. pop albums chart]]. In 1982, he released the single "[[Somebody's Baby]]" from the ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' soundtrack, which became his biggest hit, peaking at number 7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The 1983 ''[[Lawyers in Love]]'' followed, signaling a change in lyrics from the personal to the political. In 1985, he duetted with [[Clarence Clemons]] on "[[You're a Friend of Mine]]".

[[Political protest]] featured in Browne's 1986 album, ''[[Lives in the Balance]]'', explicitly condemning U.S. policy in Central America. Flavored with new instrumental textures, it was a huge success with fans, although less so with mainstream audiences. The title track was used at several points in the award-winning 1987 [[PBS]] documentary, ''The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis,'' by journalist [[Bill Moyers]].

During the 1980s, Browne performed frequently at benefits for causes he supported, including [[Farm Aid]], [[Amnesty International]] (making several appearances on the 1986 [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour), post-[[Somoza]] revolutionary Nicaragua, and the [[Christic Institute]]. The album ''[[World in Motion (album)|World in Motion]]'', released in 1989, contains a cover of [[Steven Van Zandt]]'s "I am a Patriot".

Browne also performed alongside [[Roy Orbison]] in ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night|A Black and White Night]]'' in 1988 along with [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[k.d. lang]], among others.

===1990s===

Browne wrote and recorded the song "The Rebel Jesus" with [[the Chieftains]] for their 1991 Christmas album ''[[The Bells of Dublin]]''. In 1993, Browne released ''[[I'm Alive (Jackson Browne album)|I'm Alive]]'', a critically acclaimed album with a more personal style that did respectable business despite lacking a hit single. In 1994 he collaborated with [[Kathy Mattea]] on "[[Rock Me on the Water]]" for an AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].<ref name="jrp-graphics.com">{{cite web |first=Russell |last=Paris |url=http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/jbbio.html |title=Jackson Browne – Biography |website=Jrp-graphics.com |access-date=October 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102144332/http://www.jrp-graphics.com/jb/jbbio.html |archive-date=November 2, 2011}}</ref>

He sang a duet in 1995 with [[Jann Arden]], "Unloved", on her album ''[[Living Under June]]''. Browne's own album, ''[[Looking East]]'' (1996), was released soon after, but was unsuccessful commercially.<ref name="jrp-graphics.com"/>

===2000–present===
Browne released his first album in six years, ''[[The Naked Ride Home]]'', in 2002, supporting it with an appearance on ''[[Austin City Limits]]''. He guested as himself in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Brake My Wife, Please]]" in 2003, performing a parody of his song "[[Rosie (Jackson Browne song)|Rosie]]" with lyrics altered to reference the plot.

In 2003, three of his albums, ''[[For Everyman]]'', ''[[Late for the Sky]]'', and ''[[The Pretender (album)|The Pretender]]'', were selected by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' on its list of the 500 best albums of all time.  In 2004, Browne was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. [[Bruce Springsteen]] gave the induction speech, commenting to Browne that although the Eagles were inducted first, "You wrote the songs they wished they had written."<ref>Paris, Russ.
