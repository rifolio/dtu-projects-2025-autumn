'''Pearl Jam''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Seattle]], Washington, in 1990. One of the key bands in the [[grunge|grunge movement]] of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam has outsold and outlasted many of its contemporaries and is considered one of the most influential bands from that decade,<ref>{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=''Lost Dogs'' Overview |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r666816|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=June 22, 2007 |work=Allmusic}}</ref> dubbed "the most popular American rock and roll band of the '90s".<ref name="Erlewine">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=Pearl Jam > Biography |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5118|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=June 22, 2007 |work=Allmusic}}</ref> The band has consisted of guitarists [[Stone Gossard]] and [[Mike McCready]], bassist [[Jeff Ament]], and vocalist and guitarist [[Eddie Vedder]] since its formation. The band had a revolving cast of drummers throughout their early days, including [[Dave Krusen]], [[Matt Chamberlain]], [[Dave Abbruzzese]], and [[Jack Irons]]. The band's longest-tenured drummer was [[Matt Cameron]], who joined the band in 1998 and departed in 2025. Keyboardist [[Boom Gaspar]] has also featured with the band as a session and touring musician since 2002.

Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous bands, [[Green River (band)|Green River]] and [[Mother Love Bone]], Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with their debut album - ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'' - in 1991. ''Ten'' stayed on the US ''[[Billboard 200|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]] chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock albums ever, being certified [[RIAA certification|13× platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'', sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.
 
Pearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or participating in interviews. The band unsuccessfully sued [[Ticketmaster]] in 1994, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, ''Rolling Stone'' described the band as having "spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame".<ref name="secondcoming">{{cite magazine | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pearl-jam-the-second-coming-237589/ | title = The Second Coming of Pearl Jam | magazine = Rolling Stone | date = June 16, 2006 | access-date = June 22, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211008180429/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pearl-jam-the-second-coming-237589/ |archive-date = October 8, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

Bush|George W. Bush's presidency]], with Vedder acting as its spokesman on these issues.

==History==

===Background and formation (1984–1990)===
[[Stone Gossard]] and [[Jeff Ament]] were members of Seattle-based grunge band [[Green River (band)|Green River]] during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success, but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmate [[Mark Arm]].<ref>Azerrad, Michael. ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]''. Little Brown and Company, 2001. {{ISBN|0-316-78753-1}}, p. 422.</ref> In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with [[Malfunkshun]] vocalist [[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]], eventually organizing the band [[Mother Love Bone]]. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest. [[PolyGram]] signed the band in late 1988. Mother Love Bone's debut album, ''[[Apple (Mother Love Bone album)|Apple]]'', was released in August 1990, five months after Wood died of a [[heroin overdose]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/CMJ/1990/CMJ-New-Music-Report-1990-07-20.pdf|title=Upcoming Releases|work=CMJ New Music Report|page=56|date=July 20, 1990}}</ref>

Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously.<ref name="crowe">{{cite magazine | last = Crowe | first = Cameron | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world | title = Five Against the World | magazine = Rolling Stone | date = October 28, 1993 | access-date = June 23, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070619084803/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10560431/five_against_the_world |archive-date = June 19, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament.<ref name="secondcoming" /> After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]] the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.<ref name="crowe" />

Irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his friend [[Eddie Vedder]].<ref>Wall, Mick. "Alive". ''Nirvana and the Story of Grunge''. ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' p. 95</ref> Vedder was the lead vocalist for the San Diego band [[Bad Radio]] and worked part-time at a gas station. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him.<ref name="crowe" /> He then recorded the vocals to three of the songs ("[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]", "[[Once (Pearl Jam song)|Once]]", and "Footsteps") in what he later described as a "mini-opera" titled ''Mamasan''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pearl Jam Twenty |last=Pearl Jam |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-1-84887-493-0 |page= 39|publisher=Atlantic }}</ref> Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band.<ref name="crowe" />

With the addition of [[Dave Krusen]] on drums, the band took the name Mookie Blaylock, in reference to the then-active [[Mookie Blaylock|basketball player]].<ref name="Modern Drummer 1993"/> The band played its first official show at the Off Ramp Café in Seattle on October 22, 1990.<ref name="timeline">{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.com/timeline/ | title=Pearl Jam: Timeline | access-date=June 27, 2007 | publisher=Pearljam.com |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080109033804/http://www.pearljam.com/timeline/ |archive-date = January 9, 2008}}</ref> They opened for [[Alice in Chains]] at the [[Moore Theatre]] in Seattle on December 22, 1990,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTg4whS9ClUC&q=credibility |title=Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music, 2009 |isbn=9781554903474 |access-date=June 6, 2017|last1=Prato |first1=Greg |date=December 15, 2010 |publisher=ECW Press }}</ref> and served as the opening act for the band's ''[[Facelift (album)|Facelift]]'' tour in 1991.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Robinson|first1=John|title=Kurt Cobain Raised the Bar for Us...|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/pearl_jam/interviews/12930|magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|access-date=July 21, 2017|archive-date=December 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205145416/http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/pearl_jam/interviews/12930|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twofeetthick.com/2011/02/19/we-toured-young-mookie-blaylock-alice-in-chains-199/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811174439/http://www.twofeetthick.com/2011/02/19/we-toured-young-mookie-blaylock-alice-in-chains-199/|url-status=usurped|archive-date=August 11, 2016|title=We Toured Young: Mookie Blaylock and Alice in Chains 1991|date=February 19, 2011|access-date=July 21, 2017}}</ref> Mookie Blaylock soon signed to [[Epic Records]] and renamed themselves Pearl Jam.<ref name="Erlewine" /> In an early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name "Pearl Jam" was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for [[peyote]]-laced jam.<ref name="rhrn">Neely, Kim. "Right Here, Right Now". ''Rolling Stone''. October 31, 1991.</ref> In a 2006 cover story for ''Rolling Stone'', Vedder admitted that this story was "total bullshit", but added that he did have a great-grandmother named Pearl. Ament and McCready explained that Ament came up with "pearl", and that the band later settled on Pearl Jam after attending a [[Neil Young]] concert in which he extended his songs as improvisations (i.e. "jams") of 15–20 minutes in length.<ref name="secondcoming" />

Released on August 27, 1991, ''Ten'' (named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey number)<ref name="rhrn" /> contained 11 tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. ''Ten''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an "expansive harmonic vocabulary" with an anthemic sound.<ref>{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r14978|pure_url=yes}} | title=Ten > Review | access-date=July 3, 2007 | author=Huey, Steve | website=Allmusic}}</ref> The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name="blackdays" /> ''Ten'' produced the hit singles "Alive", "[[Even Flow]]", and "[[Jeremy (song)|Jeremy]]". Originally interpreted as an anthem by many,<ref name="crowe" /> Vedder later revealed that "Alive" tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather, and his mother's grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father. In this lyric, even though Vedder originally looked at "being alive as a curse", as the sadness the speaker in the song suggests, "But as fans quickly turned the title phrase into a self-empowering anthem", particularly at Pearl Jam concerts, Vedder said: "they lifted the curse. The audience changed the meaning for me", he told VH1 Storytellers in 2006.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58253/pearl-jam-tells-its-story-at-vh1-taping|magazine=Billboard|title=Pearl Jam tells its 'story' at VH1 taping|date=June 2, 2006}}</ref>

With the success of ''Ten'', Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with [[Alice in Chains]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and [[Soundgarden]]. The band was criticized in the music press; British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' wrote that Pearl Jam was "trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets".<ref>Gilbert, Jeff. "New Power Generation". ''Guitar World: Nirvana and the Seattle Sound''. 1993.</ref>

Pearl Jam [[Ten Tour|toured]] relentlessly in support of ''Ten''. Ament stated that "essentially ''Ten'' was just an excuse to tour", adding: "We told the record company, 'We know we can be a great band, so let's just get the opportunity to get out and play.'"<ref>Coryat, Karl. "Godfather of the 'G' Word". ''Bass Player'' magazine. April 1994.</ref> The band's manager Kelly Curtis stated: "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it."<ref name="tenpast"/> Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force... But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates."<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 | title = Eddie Vedder's Embarrassing Tale: Naked in Public | magazine = Rolling Stone | date = June 20, 2006 | access-date = March 3, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080620071621/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 |archive-date = June 20, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''[[MTV Unplugged (Pearl Jam album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' and took a slot on that summer's [[Lollapalooza]] tour with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and Soundgarden, among others.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Weingarten|first=Christopher R.|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/saturday-night-live-rocks-25-greatest-musical-performances-w468638/pearl-jam-april-11th-1992-w468656|title='Saturday Night Live' Rocks: 25 Greatest Musical Performances|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=March 9, 2017|access-date=May 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Greene|first=Andy|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-pearl-jam-play-intense-black-on-mtv-unplugged-20150305|title=Flashback: Pearl Jam Play Intense 'Black' on 'MTV Unplugged'|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=March 5, 2015|access-date=May 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Montgommery|first=James|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1644863/lollapalooza-lookback-1992-meet-pearl-jam/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909120049/http://www.mtv.com/news/1644863/lollapalooza-lookback-1992-meet-pearl-jam/|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 9, 2016|title=Lollapalooza Lookback 1992: Meet Pearl Jam|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=August 2, 2010|access-date=May 25, 2018}}</ref> The band contributed two songs to the [[Singles: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] of the 1992 [[Cameron Crowe]] film ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'': "[[State of Love and Trust]]" and "[[Breath (Pearl Jam song)|Breath]]".

===''Vs.'', ''Vitalogy'' and dealing with success (1993–1995)===
[[File:President Bill Clinton with Pearl Jam.jpg|thumb|Pearl Jam with President [[Bill Clinton]] in the [[Oval Office]] in April 1994]]
The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder.<ref name="crowe" /> While Pearl Jam received four awards at the [[1993 MTV Video Music Awards]] for its video for "Jeremy", including [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]], the band refused to make a video for "[[Black (Pearl Jam song)|Black]]" in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that "Before music videos first came out, you'd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you'd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression."<ref>Neely, Kim.

Penguin Books.</ref> "Ten years from now", Ament said, "I don't want people to remember our songs as videos."<ref name="crowe" />

Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut.

The [[United States Department of Justice]] was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company.

He also stated that sources said that most of the band's third album ''[[Vitalogy]]'' was completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or the battle with Ticketmaster was to blame for the delay.<ref name="DeRogatis1"/>

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind ''Vs.'' and the majority of the tracks for ''Vitalogy'' were recorded during breaks on the tour. Tensions within the band had increased by this time. Producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] said: "''Vitalogy'' was a little strained.

''Vitalogy'' was released first on November 21, 1994, on vinyl and then two weeks later on December 6, 1994, on CD and cassette. The CD became the second-fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.<ref name="timeline"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of AllMusic stated that "thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, ''Vitalogy'' stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album".<ref>{{cite web | last = Erlewine | first = Stephen Thomas | author-link= Stephen Thomas Erlewine | url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r207150|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Vitalogy'' > Review | work = Allmusic | access-date = April 29, 2007}}</ref> Many of the songs on the album appear to be inspired by the pressures of fame.<ref>Weisel, Al.

"Better Man" ({{Audio-nohelp|Better Man.ogg|sample}}), a song originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a "blatantly great pop song" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and initially rejected it from ''Vs.'' due to its accessibility.<ref name="tenpast" /><ref name="fiveH"/>

The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its [[Vitalogy Tour|1995 tour]] for ''Vitalogy'', but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined.<ref>DeRogatis, p. 64.</ref> Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three years.<ref>DeRogatis, p. 65.</ref> Ament later said: "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour.

Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes.<ref name="Erlewine"/> Two songs from the sessions were left off ''Mirror Ball'': "[[I Got Id]]" and "Long Road".

[[File:MikeMcCready1998.jpg|thumb|left|Lead guitarist [[Mike McCready]] performing in [[Columbia, Maryland]] in September 1998]]
Following the round of touring for ''Vitalogy'', the band went into the studio to record ''[[No Code]]''.

''No Code'' included the singles "[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]" ({{Audio|Who You Are.ogg|sample}}), "[[Hail, Hail]]", and "[[Off He Goes]]". As with ''Vitalogy'', very little touring was done to promote ''No Code'' because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A [[No Code Tour|European tour]] took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was "a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time" and that "it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band".<ref name=tenpast /><ref name="fiveH"/>

Following the short tour for ''No Code'', the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort among all members of the group, with Ament stating that "everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record... because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020223212718/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433095/19980204/story.jhtml "Pearl Jam Talks About New Approach To ''Yield''"].

In April 1998, Pearl Jam again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden drummer [[Matt Cameron]] on a temporary basis,<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/articles/story/5928493/off_he_goes | title=Off He Goes | access-date=June 28, 2007 | author=Fischer, Blair R | magazine=Rolling Stone | date=April 17, 1998|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071002115935/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pearljam/articles/story/5928493/off_he_goes |archive-date = October 2, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam's 1998 [[Yield Tour]] in North America marked the band's return to full-scale touring. The band's [[Competition law|anti-trust]] lawsuit against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam again began using Ticketmaster in order to "better accommodate concertgoers".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b35954_pearl_jam_yields_ticketmaster.html | title=Pearl Jam Yields to Ticketmaster | access-date=June 27, 2007 | author=Symonds, Jeff | publisher=[[E!|E!

In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded "[[Last Kiss#Pearl Jam version|Last Kiss]]", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers]]. It was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band's 1998 fan club Christmas single. The following year, the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the [[Kosovo War]].<ref name="timeline"/> The band also decided to include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album, ''[[No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees]]''. "Last Kiss" peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' charts and became the band's highest-charting single.

Following its full-scale tour in support of ''Yield'', the band took a short break, but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]''. It was drummer Matt Cameron's studio recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the [[binaural recording]] techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer [[Tchad Blake]], known for his use of the technique.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pearljam.netmark.pl/newsy/spi.txt | title=Pearl Jam's 'Binaural' ear-marked by unusual sound mixing | access-date=June 28, 2007 | author=Stout, Gene | work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date=May 16, 2000}}</ref> ''Binaural'' was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks.

Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour ended in tragedy on June 30, with [[Roskilde Festival#2000 crush|an accident]] at the [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated as the crowd rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it was already too late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64953416.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130125030144/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64953416.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=January 25, 2013 | title=Pearl Jam's darkest hour: Seattle band thought about quitting after concert deaths | access-date=August 14, 2012 | author=Stout, Gene | work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date=September 1, 2000}}</ref>

McCready described the recording environment as "a pretty positive one" and "very intense and spiritual".<ref>Stout, Gene. [http://www.seattlepi.com/pop/95124_jam12.shtml "A charged-up Pearl Jam is really into its daring new 'Riot Act'"]. ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''. November 12, 2002.</ref> Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said: "There's been a lot of mortality... It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed."<ref>Associated Press.

November 28, 2002.</ref> Pearl Jam released ''[[Riot Act (album)|Riot Act]]'' on November 12, 2002. It included the singles "[[I Am Mine]]" and "[[Save You (Pearl Jam song)|Save You]]". The album featured a much more [[folk music|folk]]-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of [[Hammond organ|B3]] organist [[Boom Gaspar]] on songs such as "[[Love Boat Captain]]". [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of AllMusic wrote: "''Riot Act'' is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since ''Vitalogy''—a muscular [[art rock]] record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours."<ref>{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r611292|pure_url=yes}} | title=''Riot Act'' > Review | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine | website=Allmusic | access-date=April 29, 2007}}</ref> The track titled "Arc" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t2003p3.shtml | title=Pearl Jam: 2003 Concert Chronology Part 3 | access-date=July 1, 2007 | publisher=Fivehorizons.com}}</ref>

In 2003, the band embarked on its [[Riot Act Tour]], which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Western Australia; Tokyo; State College, Pennsylvania; two shows from Madison Square Garden; and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed ''Riot Act'''s "Bu$hleaguer", a commentary on President [[George W. Bush]], with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had "impaled" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's show in Denver, Colorado.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2916155.stm | title=Pearl Jam Bush Stunt Angers Fans | access-date=July 1, 2007 | publisher=[[BBC|BBC News]] | date=April 4, 2003}}</ref>

In June 2003, Pearl Jam announced it was leaving Epic Records following the end of its contract with the label.

After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam recorded the song for him. "Man of the Hour", which was later nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]], can be heard in the closing credits of ''Big Fish''.

The band released ''[[Lost Dogs (album)|Lost Dogs]]'', a two-disc collection of rarities and [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], and ''[[Live at the Garden]]'', a DVD featuring the band's July 8, 2003 [[7/8/03 - New York, New York|concert]] at Madison Square Garden through Epic Records in November 2003.

Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; recordings from the show were compiled for the album ''[[Live at Easy Street]]'' and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band embarked on a Canadian [[Pearl Jam 2005 North American/Latin American Tour|cross-country tour]] in September 2005, kicking off the tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician [[Jon Tester]] and playing [[The Gorge Amphitheatre]]. After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the [[Borgata]] casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, then closed the tour with a concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam's official website in MP3 form. Pearl Jam also played a benefit concert to raise money for [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief on October 5, 2005, at the [[House of Blues]] in Chicago. On November 22, 2005, Pearl Jam began its first Latin American tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/eddie-vedder/news/rock-veterans-pearl-jam-rock-brazil--26558382 |title=Rock veterans Pearl Jam rock Brazil |access-date=July 2, 2007 |agency=Reuters |work=Yahoo!

===Move to J Records and ''Pearl Jam'' (2006–2008)===

The work for Pearl Jam's follow-up to ''Riot Act'' began after its appearance on the 2004 [[Vote for Change]] tour. The time period between the two albums was the longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date and the new album was its first release for a new label. [[Clive Davis]] announced in February 2006 that Pearl Jam had signed with his label [[J Records]], which like Epic, is part of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (then known as [[Sony BMG]]), though J has since folded into [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/09/sbt.01.html | title=Showbiz Tonight | access-date=September 3, 2007 | publisher=CNN |date=February 9, 2006}}</ref> The album ''[[Pearl Jam (album)|Pearl Jam]]'' was released on May 2, 2006.

"[[World Wide Suicide]]", a song criticizing the [[Iraq War]] and U.S. foreign policy, was released as a single and topped the [[Alternative Songs|''Billboard'' Modern Rock]] chart; it was Pearl Jam's first number one on that chart since "[[Who You Are (Pearl Jam song)|Who You Are]]" in 1996, and first number one on any chart in the United States since 1998 when "[[Given to Fly]]" reached number one on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart. ''Pearl Jam'' also included the singles "[[Life Wasted]]" and "[[Gone (Pearl Jam song)|Gone]]".

To support ''Pearl Jam'', the band embarked on its [[Pearl Jam 2006 World Tour|2006 world tour]]. It toured North America, Australia and notably Europe; Pearl Jam had not toured the continent for six years. The North American tour included three two-night stands opening for [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10025035/tom_petty_readies_summer_tour | title=Tom Petty Readies Summer Tour | access-date=July 22, 2009 | author=Rogulewski, Charley | magazine=Rolling Stone | date=April 20, 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070602102253/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10025035/tom_petty_readies_summer_tour |archive-date = June 2, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band served as the headliners for the [[Reading and Leeds Festival|Leeds]] and [[Reading Festival|Reading]] festivals, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]]. Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde had nothing to do with "guts" but with trust in the audience.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,1859687,00.html | title=Leeds Festival | access-date=July 1, 2007 | author=Simpson, Dave. |work=The Guardian | date=August 28, 2006}}</ref>

Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less [[Hook (music)|catchy]].

Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a "[[Jim Morrison]]-like vocal growl".<ref>DeRogatis, p. 57.</ref> Greg Prato of AllMusic stated: "With his hard-hitting and often confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock."<ref>{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p134417|pure_url=yes}} | title = Eddie Vedder > Biography | access-date=April 20, 2009 | last = Prato | first = Greg | work =Allmusic}}</ref> Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", "Better Man") to social and political concerns ("Even Flow", "World Wide Suicide").

The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the ''Vitalogy'' era. McCready said in 2006: "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now.

When asked about Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said: "I think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in.

Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political issues, from abortion rights sentiments to opposition to [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush's presidency]].

The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of the abortion rights movement. In 1992, ''Spin'' printed an article by Vedder, titled "Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion.<ref>Vedder, Eddie. "Reclamation". ''Spin''.

As members of [[Rock the Vote]] and [[Vote for Change]], the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in [[Elections in the United States|United States elections]].

In 2006, the members of Pearl Jam founded the non-profit organization Vitalogy Foundation.

Vedder sometimes comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including "Bu$hleaguer" and "[[World Wide Suicide]]", are openly critical of the [[Presidency of George W.
