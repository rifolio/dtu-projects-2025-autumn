'''The Smashing Pumpkins''' (also simply known as '''Smashing Pumpkins'''){{refn|group=note|name=first|"Smashing Pumpkins" at the [https://www.billboard.com/artist/279618/smashing-pumpkins ''Billboard'' database] and [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/smashing-pumpkins-mn0000036521/ at AllMusic.com], and as both [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/smashing-pumpkin "Smashing Pumpkins"] and [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-smashing-pumpkins "The Smashing Pumpkins"] at the ''Rolling Stone'' database. The band is credited as "Smashing Pumpkins" on the covers of ''Gish'', ''Siamese Dream'', and ''Zeitgeist'' (and related singles), and as "The Smashing Pumpkins" between ''Mellon Collie'' (1995) and ''Earphoria'' (2002), as well as on all releases since ''Oceania'' in 2012.}} are an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in [[Chicago]] in 1988 by frontman and guitarist [[Billy Corgan]], guitarist [[James Iha]], bassist [[D'arcy Wretzky]] and drummer [[Jimmy Chamberlin]]. The band has undergone [[List of the Smashing Pumpkins band members|several line-up changes]] since their reunion in 2006, with Corgan being the primary songwriter and sole constant member since its inception. The current lineup consists of Corgan, Iha, and Chamberlin. The band is known for its diverse, densely layered sound, which evolved throughout their career and has integrated elements of [[gothic rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[grunge]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[shoegaze]], [[dream pop]], and [[electronica]].

The band's debut album, ''[[Gish]]'' (1991), was well-received by critics and became an underground success. In the advent of alternative rock's mainstream breakthrough, their second album, ''[[Siamese Dream]]'' (1993), established the band's popularity. Despite a tumultuous recording process, the album received widespread acclaim and has been lauded as one of the best albums in the genre. Their third album, ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]'' (1995), furthered the band's popularity; it debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], received a [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and continued the band's critical success. After the release of ''[[Adore (album)|Adore]]'' (1998) and a two-part project in 2000—''[[Machina/The Machines of God|Machina]]'' and ''[[Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music|Machina II]]''—the group disbanded due to internal conflicts, drug use, and diminishing sales by the end of the 1990s. With 30&nbsp;million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were among the most critically and commercially successful bands of the 1990s, and an important act in the popularization of alternative rock.

In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record the band's seventh album, ''[[Zeitgeist (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Zeitgeist]]''. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist [[Jeff Schroeder]], Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled ''[[Teargarden by Kaleidyscope]]'', which encompassed stand-alone singles, EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—''[[Oceania (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Oceania]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Monuments to an Elegy]]'' in 2014. Chamberlin became a touring member in 2015, before officially rejoining with Iha in 2018. The reunited lineup then released the albums ''[[Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.]]'' (2018) and ''[[Cyr (album)|Cyr]]'' (2020), in addition to ''[[Atum: A Rock Opera in Three Acts]]'' across three increments between 2022 and 2023. Schroeder departed from the band in October 2023. Following Schroeder's departure, the band's remaining members released ''[[Aghori Mhori Mei]]'' (2024).

==History==
===Early years: 1988–1991===
[[file:Billy Corgan in 1992.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Vocalist [[Billy Corgan]] in 1992]]
After the breakup of his [[gothic rock]] and metal band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and returned to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and had the idea to start a band called the Smashing Pumpkins.<ref name="atn">{{cite web |url=http://www.starla.org/articles/dares.htm |title=Smashing Pumpkin D'Arcy Dares To Be Happy |first=Michael |last=Goldberg |work=[[Addicted to Noise]] |access-date=March 4, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127233048/http://www.starla.org/articles/dares.htm |archive-date=November 27, 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.spin.com/2013/07/billy-dont-be-a-hero-smashing-pumpkins-cover-story/|title=Billy, Don't Be a Hero|first=Jim|last=Greer|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 1993|access-date=August 18, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904025157/http://www.spin.com/2013/07/billy-dont-be-a-hero-smashing-pumpkins-cover-story/|archive-date=September 4, 2015}}</ref> While working at the store he met guitarist [[James Iha]]. Adorning themselves with [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs (with the aid of a [[drum machine]]) which were heavily influenced by [[the Cure]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]].<ref name="seeds">{{cite journal |last=Kot |first=Greg |author-link=Greg Kot |title=Pumpkin Seeds |journal=[[Guitar World]] |date=January 2002}}</ref> The duo performed live for the first time on July 9, 1988, at the Polish bar Chicago 21.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/smashing-pumpkins-facts-2246473|title=50 incredibly geeky facts about Smashing Pumpkins|last=Braidwood|first=Ella|date=2018-02-22|website=NME|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref> This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pic.twitter.com/ptMxVNgrcV|title=Smashing Pumpkins|quote=25 years ago today we played our 1st show.

[[Jazz]] drummer [[Jimmy Chamberlin]] was recommended by a friend of Corgan's.<ref name="modern drummer" /> Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed the sound of the nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, "We were completely into the sad-rock, [[The Cure|Cure]] kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined."<ref name="seeds" /> On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage for the first time at the Cabaret Metro.<ref name="modern drummer" />

In 1989, the Smashing Pumpkins made their first appearance on record with the compilation album ''Light Into Dark'', which featured several Chicago alternative bands. The group released its first single, "[[I Am One]]", in 1990 on the local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single sold out and they released a follow-up, "[[Tristessa (song)|Tristessa]]", on [[Sub Pop]]; then they signed to [[Caroline Records (U.S.)|Caroline Records]].<ref name="advocate">{{cite news |last=Keedle |first=Jayne |title=Patchin' It Back Together |newspaper=[[Hartford Advocate]] |date=October 1, 1996}}</ref> The band recorded their 1991 debut studio album ''[[Gish]]'' with producer [[Butch Vig]] at his [[Smart Studios]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin, for {{USD|20,000|long=no}}.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kot |first=Greg |author-link=Greg Kot |title=Out of the Patch for Smashing Pumpkins, New Album Is Another Sign of Liftoff |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=June 21, 1991}}</ref> In order to gain the consistency he desired, Corgan often played all instruments excluding drums, which created tension in the band.

===Mainstream breakout and ''Siamese Dream'': 1992–1994===
With the breakthrough of alternative rock into the American mainstream due to the popularity of [[grunge]] bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pearl Jam]], the Smashing Pumpkins were poised for major commercial success. At this time, the Smashing Pumpkins were routinely lumped in with the grunge movement, with Corgan protesting, "We've graduated now from 'the next Jane's Addiction' to 'the next Nirvana', now we're 'the next Pearl Jam'."<ref>{{cite interview |last= Corgan |first= Billy |work= 120 Minutes|title=Corgan interview |publisher= MTV |date=October 1993}}</ref>

[[File:James Iha.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Guitarist [[James Iha]] in 1995]]
Amid this environment of intense internal pressure for the band to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to [[Marietta, Georgia]], in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer.<ref name="seeds" /> The decision to record so far away from their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections.<ref name="seeds" /> The recording environment for ''[[Siamese Dream]]'' was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with ''Gish'', Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment.<ref name="impact">[[Michael Azerrad|Azerrad, Michael]].

The album spawned five singles—"Bullet with Butterfly Wings", "[[1979 (song)|1979]]", "[[Zero (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Zero]]", "[[Tonight, Tonight (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Tonight, Tonight]]" which Corgan stated was inspired by the [[Cheap Trick]] song "I'll Be with You Tonight",<ref>Billy Corgan quote about Cheap Trick inspiring "Tonight, Tonight" from ''The Howard Stern Show'', 2014</ref> and "[[Thirty-Three (song)|Thirty-Three]]"—of which the first three were certified gold and all but "Zero" entered the Top 40. Many of the songs that did not make it onto ''Mellon Collie'' were released as B-sides to the singles, and were later compiled in ''[[The Aeroplane Flies High]]'' box set. The set was originally limited to 200,000 copies, but more were produced to meet demand.<ref>{{cite web| date=December 16, 1996 | title= Pumpkins' "Collectors" Set Has Mass Appeal |publisher=MTV| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434226/12161996/smashing_pumpkins.jhtml | access-date=August 30, 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434226/12161996/smashing_pumpkins.jhtml| archive-date = May 9, 2007}}</ref>

In 1996 the Pumpkins undertook an extended world tour in support of ''Mellon Collie''. Corgan's look during this period—a shaved head, a long-sleeve black shirt with the word "Zero" printed on it, and silver pants—became iconic.<ref>{{cite interview |last= Corgan |first= Billy |work= Breakfast with Billy|title=Corgan interview | publisher= [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] | location= Los Angeles | date= February 2, 1996}}</ref> That year, the band also made a guest appearance in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Homerpalooza]]". With considerable video rotation on MTV, major industry awards, and "Zero" shirts selling in many malls, the Pumpkins were considered one of the most popular bands of the time.<ref>Marks, Craig.

In May, the Smashing Pumpkins played a gig at the [[Point Theatre]] in Dublin, Ireland. Despite the band's repeated requests for [[moshing]] to stop, a seventeen-year-old fan named Bernadette O'Brien was crushed to death. The concert ended early and the following night's performance in Belfast was cancelled out of respect for her.<ref>{{cite web | year= 1996 | title= Fan Crushed at Smashing Pumpkin's Show | publisher= MTV | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434230/19960517/smashing_pumpkins.jhtml | access-date= June 23, 2006 | url-status= dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071001103626/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434230/19960517/smashing_pumpkins.jhtml | archive-date= October 1, 2007 | df= mdy-all }}</ref> However, while Corgan maintained that moshing's "time [had] come and gone", the band would continue to request open-floor concerts throughout the rest of the tour.<ref>Durando, Stu.

The band suffered a personal tragedy on the night of July 11, 1996, when touring keyboardist [[Jonathan Melvoin]] and Chamberlin overdosed on heroin in a hotel room in New York City. Melvoin died, and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession. A few days later, the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired as a result of the incident.<ref>{{cite web |author=Errico, Marcus |date=July 17, 1996 |title=Smashing Pumpkins Drum Out Jimmy Chamberlin |publisher=Eonline.com |url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/smashing_pumpkins_drum_out_jimmy/33410 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228094359/http://www.eonline.com/news/33410/smashing-pumpkins-drum-out-jimmy-chamberlin |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 28, 2013 |access-date=December 18, 2011 }}</ref> The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour, and hired drummer [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] and keyboardist [[Dennis Flemion]].

But in recent years, he had reportedly been clean. On July 17, the Pumpkins issued a statement in which they said, "For nine years we have battled with Jimmy's struggles with the insidious disease of drug and alcohol addiction. It has nearly destroyed everything we are and stand for. … We wish [him] the best we have to offer".<ref>Hendrickson, Matt.

After the release of ''Mellon Collie'', the Pumpkins contributed many songs to various compilations. Released in early 1997, the song "[[Eye (song)|Eye]]", which appeared on the soundtrack to [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'', relied almost exclusively on electronic instruments and signaled a drastic shift from the Pumpkins' previous musical styles. At the time, Corgan stated his "idea [was] to reconfigure the focus and get away from the classic guitars-bass-drum rock format."<ref>Gundersen, Edna. "Smashing that Pumpkins stereotype Band shuns 'tragic' label', ''[[USA Today]]''. February 26, 1997.</ref> Later that year, the group contributed "[[The End Is the Beginning Is the End]]" to the [[Film soundtrack|soundtrack]] for the film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''. With Matt Walker on drums, the song featured a heavy sound similar to "Bullet with Butterfly Wings" while still having strong electronic influences. The song later won the [[Grammy Awards of 1998|1998 Grammy]] for Best Hard Rock Performance. Though Corgan announced that the song represented the sound people could expect from the band in the future,<ref>{{cite video | people = Chris Connelly | title = MTV's Week in Rock | medium = TV-Series| publisher = MTV | date = May 2, 1997 }}</ref> the band's next album would feature few guitar-driven songs.

Recorded following the death of Corgan's mother and his divorce, 1998's ''[[Adore (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Adore]]'' represented a significant change of style from the Pumpkins' previous guitar-based rock, veering into electronica. The record, cut with assistance from drum machines and studio drummers including Matt Walker, was infused with a darker aesthetic than much of the band's earlier work. The group also modified its public image, shedding its alternative rock look for a more subdued appearance. Although ''Adore'' received favorable reviews and was nominated for Best Alternative Performance at the Grammy Awards, the album had only sold about 830,000 copies in the United States by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite magazine| author=Fricke, David| date=December 29, 1998| title=When Billy Corgan Speaks...| magazine=Rolling Stone| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/smashingpumpkins/articles/story/5921548/when_billy_corgan_speaks| access-date=May 5, 2006| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127051909/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/smashingpumpkins/articles/story/5921548/when_billy_corgan_speaks| archive-date=January 27, 2007| df=mdy-all}}</ref> The album nonetheless debuted at number 2 on the ''Billboard'' 200<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/1998-06-20|title=Billboard 200 Chart (June 20, 1998)|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=September 4, 2020}}</ref> and sold three times as many copies overseas.<ref name="seeds" /> The band began a seventeen-date, fifteen-city charity North American tour in support of ''Adore''.

In 1999 the band surprised fans by reuniting with a rehabilitated Jimmy Chamberlin for a brief tour dubbed "The Arising", which showcased both new and classic material. The lineup was short-lived, however, as the band announced the departure of Wretzky in September during work on the album ''[[Machina/The Machines of God]]'', and the band was subsequently dropped by [[Sharon Osbourne Management]].<ref>{{cite magazine|date=September 10, 1999 |title=D'Arcy Exits Smashing Pumpkins |magazine=Billboard |url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=950611 |access-date=February 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929152600/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=950611 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=January 2000 |title=Smashing Pumpkins 2000 |url=http://www.addict.com/issues/6.03/html/hifi/Cover_Story/Smashing_Pumpkins/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816145732/http://www.addict.com/issues/6.03/html/hifi/Cover_Story/Smashing_Pumpkins/ |archive-date=August 16, 2000 |access-date=November 16, 2022 |website=[[Addicted to Noise]]}}</ref> Former [[Hole (band)|Hole]] bassist [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] was recruited for the "Sacred and Profane" tour in support of the album and appeared in the videos accompanying its release.

On December 2, 2000, Smashing Pumpkins played a farewell concert at The Metro, the same Chicago club where their career had effectively started twelve years earlier. The four-and-a-half-hour-long show featured 35 songs spanning the group's career, and attendees were given a recording of the band's first concert at The Metro, ''[[Live at Cabaret Metro 10-5-88]]''.<ref name=wonder /> The single "[[Untitled (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Untitled]]" was released commercially to coincide with the farewell show.

===Post-breakup: 2001–2004===
In 2001 the compilation ''[[Rotten Apples]]'' was released. The double-disc version of the album, released as a limited edition, included a collection of B-sides and rarities called <!--SEE JUDAS O DISCUSSION-->''[[Judas O]]''. The ''[[Greatest Hits Video Collection]]'' DVD was also released at the same time. This was a compilation of all of the Pumpkins promo videos from ''Gish'' to ''Machina'' along with unreleased material.<ref>There is one notable omission, "The End Is the Beginning Is the End". This was excluded because the rights are owned by [[Warner Bros.]], which loaned out the band from their regular label, Virgin Records.</ref> ''Vieuphoria'' was released on DVD in 2002, as was the soundtrack album ''[[Earphoria]]'', previously released solely to radio stations in 1994.

Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reunited in 2001 as members of Corgan's next project, the short-lived [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Zwan]]. The group's only album, ''[[Mary Star of the Sea (album)|Mary Star of the Sea]]'', was released in 2003. After cancelling a few festival appearances, Corgan announced the demise of the band in 2003. During 2001 Corgan also toured as part of [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and provided vocals on their comeback album ''[[Get Ready (New Order album)|Get Ready]]''. In October 2004 Corgan released his first book, ''[[Blinking with Fists]]'', a collection of poetry. In June 2005, he released a solo album, ''[[TheFutureEmbrace]]'', which he described as "(picking) up the thread of the as-yet-unfinished work of the Smashing Pumpkins".<ref name="message">Corgan, Billy. "A Message to Chicago from Billy Corgan", ''Chicago Tribune'', June 21, 2005.</ref> Despite this, it was greeted with generally mixed reviews and lackluster sales. Only one single, "Walking Shade", was released in support of the album.

In addition to drumming with Zwan, Jimmy Chamberlin also formed an alternative rock/[[jazz fusion]] project band called [[Jimmy Chamberlin Complex]]. The group released an album in 2005 titled ''[[Life Begins Again]]''. Corgan provided guest vocals on the track "Lokicat". James Iha served as a guitarist in [[A Perfect Circle]], appearing on their ''Thirteenth Step'' club tour and 2004 album, ''[[eMOTIVe]]''. He has also been involved with other acts such as [[Chino Moreno]]'s [[Team Sleep]] and [[Vanessa and the O's]]. He continues to work with [[Scratchie Records]], his own record label, as well. D'arcy Wretzky has, aside from one radio interview in 2009, not made any public statements or appearances nor given any interviews since leaving the band in 1999. On January 25, 2000, she was arrested after she allegedly purchased three bags of [[cocaine]], but after successfully completing a court-ordered drug education program, the charges were dropped.<ref>{{cite web |author=Rosen, Craig |date=May 22, 2000 |title=Ex-Pumpkin D'Arcy Wretzky Has Crack Case Wiped Clean |publisher=Yahoo.com |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051688?ev=29644410 |access-date=May 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130101144034/http://www.music.yahoo.ca/read/news/12051688 |archive-date=January 1, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Jim DeRogatis wrote in a 1993 ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' article that Corgan's lyrics "too often sound like sophomoric poetry",<ref>DeRogatis, p. 80.</ref> although he viewed the lyrics of later albums ''Adore'' and ''Machina'' as an improvement.<ref>DeRogatis, p. 88.</ref> The band's songs have been described as "anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land" by journalist William Shaw.<ref name="Shaw 93">{{cite journal |first=William|last=Shaw |title=Appetite for Destruction |journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details]] |date=December 1993 |volume=362 |issue=6419 |page=406 |doi=10.1038/362406a0 |bibcode=1993Natur.362Q.406. }}</ref>

The band's distinctive sound up until ''Adore'' involved layering numerous guitar tracks onto a song during the recording process, a tactic that ''Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness'' co-producer Flood called the "Pumpkin guitar overdub army."<ref name="zeroguitar" /> Although there were a lot of overdubbed parts on ''Gish'', Corgan began to really explore the possibilities of overdubbing with ''Siamese Dream''; Corgan has stated that "Soma" alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts.<ref name=siamesedream>Aledort, Andrew. "Introduction", in ''Siamese Dream Songbook''. Miami: Warner Bros. Publications, 1994.</ref> While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert (in fact, some songs were drastically altered for live performance), he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question "When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song, why not endow it with the grandest possible vision?"<ref>Corgan, Billy. "Guitar Geek USA" column. ''Guitar World'', January 1996.</ref> This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan's love of 1970s popular artists and bands such as [[David Bowie]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Boston (band)|Boston]], and the [[Electric Light Orchestra]],<ref name="siamesedream" /> as well as [[shoegaze]], a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect. ''Mellon Collie'' coproducer Alan Moulder was originally hired to mix ''Siamese Dream'' because Corgan was a fan of his work producing shoegaze bands such as [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Ride (band)|Ride]], and [[Slowdive]].<ref>DeRogatis, p. 78.</ref>

Like many contemporary alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. Hüsker Dü's seminal album ''[[Zen Arcade]]'' demonstrated to the band how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare,<ref name="seeds" /> and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central to the pursuit of his grand musical ambitions.<ref>Corgan, Billy. "Guitar Geek USA [column]", ''Guitar World''. September 1995.</ref> Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, "Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is what it sounds like on Planet Pumpkin."<ref>DeRogatis, p. 76.</ref> This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to ''Adore'' (described as "arcane night music" in prerelease promotion)<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil |date=January 14, 1998 |title=Pumpkins Recording Album of "Arcane Night Music" |publisher=Addicted to Noise/JamesIha.org |url=http://jamesiha.org/newsdatabase.php?id=1534 |access-date=September 7, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802125549/http://www.jamesiha.org/newsdatabase.php?id=1534 |archive-date=August 2, 2007  }}</ref> and the ''Machina'' albums (concept records that tell the story of a fictional rock band).<ref name="seeds" />

The Pumpkins drew inspiration from a variety of other genres, some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics. Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal, citing [[Dimebag Darrell]] of [[Pantera]] as his favorite contemporary guitarist.<ref name="zeroguitar" /><ref>Corgan, Billy. "Guitar Geek USA [column]", ''Guitar World''. August 1995.</ref> When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that "Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that relegitimized heavy metal" and that they "were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like [[Ozzy Osbourne|Ozzy]] and [[Black Sabbath]] with anything other than contempt", Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath's ''[[Master of Reality]]'' and [[Judas Priest]]'s ''[[Unleashed in the East]]''.<ref name="zeroguitar" /> The song "Zero", which reminded Iha of Judas Priest, is an example of what the band dubbed "cybermetal".<ref>"Killer B's." ''Guitar World'', January 1997.</ref> Other bands Corgan cited as influences are [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], [[Accept (band)|Accept]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Dokken]], [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]] and [[Myrkur]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-04-28 |title=SMASHING PUMPKINS' BILLY CORGAN picks 11 greatest heavy-metal bands ever |url=https://www.revolvermag.com/premium-video/music/smashing-pumpkins-billy-corgan-picks-11-greatest-heavy-metal-bands-ever |access-date=2024-06-04 |website=Revolver |language=en}}</ref>

[[Post-punk]] and gothic rock bands like [[Joy Division]]/[[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], [[the Cure]], and [[Depeche Mode]] were formative influences on the band, which covered such artists in concert and on record. Corgan also cited [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] saying it was important to point back to bands that influenced them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crestfallen.com/2011/10/28/billy-corgan-plays-x-tracks-while-hosting-siriusxm-lithium-station/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831121706/http://www.crestfallen.com/2011/10/28/billy-corgan-plays-x-tracks-while-hosting-siriusxm-lithium-station/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 31, 2013 |title=Billy Corgan plays X tracks while hosting SiriusXM Lithium station |work=crestfallen.com |date=October 28, 2011 |access-date=July 14, 2015}}</ref> [[Psychedelic rock]] was also referenced often in the band's early recordings; according to Corgan, "In typical Pumpkins fashion, no one at that point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music so, of course, that's exactly what we had to do."<ref>Commentary for "Siva" music video. ''The Smashing Pumpkins 1991–2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection'' (Virgin Records, 2001).</ref> Corgan felt that the band's guitars "are a mixture of heavy metal and 80s alternative rock.

Regarding the band's influence upon other groups, Greg Kot wrote in 2001, "Whereas Nirvana spawned countless mini-Nirvanas, the Pumpkins remain an island unto themselves."<ref name="seeds" /> Still, several artists and bands have considered the Pumpkins as an influence, such as [[Nelly Furtado]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Lyndsey |author-link=Lyndsey Parker |title=Exclusive LAUNCH Artist Chat |work=Nelly Furtado |publisher=Yahoo!

==Music videos==
[[File:Smashing pumpkins tonight video 02.jpg|thumb |right |alt=The set from the "Tonight, Tonight" music video features the performers dressed in Victorian clothing on a colorful set mimicking the moon. A moon monster is portrayed by a man on the left of the photo; he has on a pale green form-fitting jumpsuit with large blue and purple dots on it and wears matching make-up. On his head is a large prosthesis mimicking tall pale green hair. A man stands to the right wearing a suit and bowler and in front of him is a woman wearing a flowing gown. The woman has just struck another moon monster with an umbrella, and the moon monster has disappeared in a puff of smoke.|Drawing heavy influence from [[Georges Méliès]]'s ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'', the video for "[[Tonight, Tonight (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Tonight, Tonight]]" was filmed in the style of a turn-of-the-century [[silent film]] using theater-style backdrops and primitive special effects.<ref>Commentary for "Tonight, Tonight" music video. ''The Smashing Pumpkins 1991–2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection'' (Virgin Records, 2001).</ref>]]
The Smashing Pumpkins have been praised as "responsible for some of the most striking and memorable video clips" and for having "approached videos from a completely artistic standpoint rather than mere commercials to sell albums".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r559297 |title=Greatest Hits <nowiki>[Video/DVD]</nowiki> |author=Greg Prato |work=Allmusic |access-date=March 4, 2012}}</ref> MTV's 2001 anniversary special ''Testimony: 20&nbsp;Years of Rock on MTV'' credited the Pumpkins, along with [[Nine Inch Nails]], with treating music videos as an art form during the 1990s. Corgan has said, "We generally resisted the idea of what I call the classic MTV rock video, which is like lots of people jumping around and stuff."<ref>Commentary for "Bullet with Butterfly Wings" music video. ''The Smashing Pumpkins 1991–2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection'' (Virgin Records, 2001).</ref> The band worked with video directors including [[Kevin Kerslake]] ("Cherub Rock"), [[Samuel Bayer]] ("Bullet with Butterfly Wings"), and, most frequently, the team of [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris]] ("[[Rocket (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Rocket]]", "1979", "Tonight, Tonight", "The End Is the Beginning Is the End", and "[[Perfect (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Perfect]]"). Corgan, who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos, said of Dayton and Faris, "I know my [initial] versions are always darker, and they're always talking me into something a little kinder and gentler."<ref>Commentary for "Rocket" music video. ''The Smashing Pumpkins 1991–2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection'' (Virgin Records, 2001).</ref> Videos like "[[Today (The Smashing Pumpkins song)|Today]]", "Rocket", and "1979" dealt with images taken from middle American culture, albeit exaggerated. The group's videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for "Thirty-Three", with images closely related to the words of the song, was created as an intentional stylistic departure.<ref>Commentary for "Thirty-Three" music video. ''The Smashing Pumpkins 1991–2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection'' (Virgin Records, 2001).</ref>

The band was nominated for several [[MTV Video Music Awards]] during the 1990s. In 1996, the group won eight VMAs total for the "1979" and "Tonight, Tonight" videos, including the top award, Video of the Year, for "Tonight, Tonight". The video was also nominated for a Grammy at the 1997 ceremony. Of the "Tonight, Tonight" video, Corgan remarked, "I don't think we've ever had people react [like this]... it just seemed to touch a nerve."<ref>{{cite interview |last=Corgan |first=Billy |work=Smashing Pumpkins Videography |title=Interview|publisher=MTV |year=1996}}</ref>

Shortly after the band's 2000 breakup, the ''Greatest Hits Video Collection'' was released, collecting the band's music videos from 1991 to 2000 and including commentary from Corgan, Iha, Chamberlin, Wretzky, and various music video directors with outtakes, live performances, and the extended "Try, Try, Try" short film.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prato|first1=Greg|title=Greatest Hits [Video/DVD]|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-video-dvd-mw0000017160|website=Allmusic|access-date=July 28, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929040147/http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-video-dvd-mw0000017160|archive-date=September 29, 2014}}</ref>
