'''The White Stripes''' were<!-- Because "The White Stripes" is a plural name, we have to use "were" instead of "was". If their name was "The White Stripe" we would use "was" instead of "were" per American English standards. Do not change to "was".--> an American rock duo formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1997. The group consisted of [[Jack White]] (guitar, keyboards, piano, vocals) and [[Meg White]] (drums, percussion, vocals). They were a leading group of 2000s [[indie rock]] and the decade's [[Post-punk revival|garage rock revival]].

Beginning in the late 1990s, the White Stripes sought success within the [[Music of Detroit#1980s and 1990s|Detroit music scene]], releasing six singles and two albums. They found commercial success with their third album, ''[[White Blood Cells]]'' (2001), which received critical acclaim and propelled the band to the forefront of the garage rock revival. Their fourth album, ''[[Elephant (album)|Elephant]]'' (2003), drew further success, winning the band their first [[Grammy Awards]]. The band [[Experimental music|experimented]] extensively on their fifth album, ''[[Get Behind Me Satan]]'' (2005). They returned to their [[blues]] roots with their sixth and final album, ''[[Icky Thump]]'' (2007), which was praised like the band's earlier albums. By the end of the 2000s, the White Stripes had accumulated entries on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] including "[[Seven Nation Army]]", "[[Blue Orchid]]" and "[[Icky Thump (song)|Icky Thump]]"; the formermost became a sports anthem. Other [[Music recording certification|certified]] singles include "[[Fell in Love with a Girl]]", "[[The Hardest Button to Button]]", "[[Blue Orchid]]" and "[[My Doorbell]]".

The White Stripes used a [[Lo-fi music|low-fidelity]] approach to writing and recording. Their music featured a melding of [[garage rock]] and [[blues]] influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo were noted for their mysterious public image, their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black—which was used on every album and single cover they released—and their fascination with the number three. They made selective media appearances, including [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s anthology film ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'' (2003) and the documentary ''[[Under Great White Northern Lights]]'' (2009). After a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording, the band dissolved in 2011.

The White Stripes have released six studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, and one extended play. They have received [[List of awards and nominations received by the White Stripes|numerous accolades]], including six Grammy Awards from eleven nominations. The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] included ''White Blood Cells'' on their "[[List of 200 Definitive Albums in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|200 Definitive Albums]]" list. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked ''White Blood Cells'' and ''Elephant'' on their list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]", and named the band the sixth greatest duo of all time in 2015. The White Stripes have been selected [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees|to be inducted]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2025, after being nominated in 2023 (the band's first year of eligibility).

Another theory about this title is that Jack and Meg White read James Joyce's story collection "Dubliners" (published 1914) and used a line from the final story "The Dead" to title this album. The title is also a direct quotation from [[The Who|Who]] bassist [[John Entwistle]]'s solo song "You're Mine".

With its reliance on piano-driven melodies and experimentation with [[marimba]] on "The Nurse" and "Forever For Her (Is Over For Me)", ''Get Behind Me Satan'' did not feature the explicit blues and punk styles that dominated earlier White Stripes albums.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The White Stripes: Get Behind Me Satan |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8653-get-behind-me-satan/ |access-date=April 1, 2023 |website=Pitchfork |language=en-US |archive-date=January 24, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240124042052/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8653-get-behind-me-satan/ |url-status=live }}</ref> However, despite this, the band was critically lauded for their "fresh, arty reinterpretations of their classic inspirations."<ref name="allmusic1" /> It has garnered positive reactions from fans, as well as critical acclaim, receiving more Grammy nominations as well as making them one of the must-see acts of the decade.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nicholson|first1=Barry|title=White Out| work= NME New Musical Express|date=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/w/white-stripes/get-behind-me-satan.shtml |title=Get Behind Me Satan |last= Murphy| first= Matthew |website=Pitchfork |date=June 6, 2005 |access-date=August 30, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115175516/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/w/white-stripes/get-behind-me-satan.shtml/ |archive-date=January 15, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' ranked it the third best album of the year<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/special/8952414/the_top_50_records_of_2005 ''Rolling Stone'' Magazine's Top 50 Records of 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202234303/http://www.rollingstone.com/special/8952414/the_top_50_records_of_2005 |date=February 2, 2007 }}.

=== Post-breakup ===
[[File:Jack White - Live 2012.jpg|thumb|Jack (pictured in 2012) embarked on a solo music career following the breakup of the White Stripes, beginning with his debut album [[Blunderbuss (album)|''Blunderbuss'']] (2012).]]

In a 2001 ''New York Times'' concert review, Ann Powers noted that Jack's "ingenious" playing was "constrained by [Meg's] deliberately undeveloped approach", and that "he created more challenges by playing an acoustic guitar with paper taped over the hole and a less-than-high-quality solid body electric."<ref name="powers" />

=== Aesthetic and presentation ===
[[File:TheWhiteStripes 2007.jpg|left|thumb|The White Stripes (pictured in 2007) exclusively donned red, white and black colors in public appearances and performances.]]
The White Stripes had a carefully constructed image built around lore they created for themselves and visual motifs. Early in their history, they turned down a potential deal with Chicago label Bobsled, because the label wanted to put its green logo on the CD.<ref name="eels" /> Their presentation was a subject of intrigue among the public and in the media. They made exclusive use of a red, white and black color scheme when conducting virtually all professional duties, from album art to the clothes worn during live performances.<ref name="WOW" /> Jack told ''Rolling Stone'' in 2005 that "The White Stripes' colors were always red, white, and black. It came from peppermint candy. I also think they are the most powerful color combination of all time, from a Coca-Cola can to a Nazi banner. Those colors strike chords with people. In Japan, they are honorable colors. When you see a bride in a white gown, you immediately see innocence in that. Red is anger and passion. It is also sexual. And black is the absence of all that."<ref name="WOW" /> He also explained that they aspired to invoke an innocent childishness without any intention of irony or humor.<ref name="Klosterman2" /> Meg said that "like a uniform at school, you can just focus on what you're doing because everybody's wearing the same thing."<ref name="SWEET" /> They also cited the [[minimalism|minimalist]] and [[deconstruction]]ist aspects of [[De Stijl]] design as a source of inspiration.<ref>{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Brian |date=March 8, 2001 |title=Stars and Stripes |url=http://citybeat.com/March |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210411020259/https://www.citybeat.com/March |archive-date=April 11, 2021 |access-date=June 20, 2008 |work=CityBeat.com}}</ref>

The media and fans alike varied between intrigue and skepticism at the band's appearance and presentation. Andy Gershon, president of the V2 label at the time of their signing, was reluctant to sign them, saying, "They need a bass player, they've got this red-and-white gimmick, and the songs are fantastic, but they've recorded very raw...how is this going to be on radio?"<ref name="Klosterman2" /> In a 2002 ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine article, [[Chuck Klosterman]] wondered, "how can two media-savvy kids posing as brother and sister, wearing [[Dr. Seuss]] clothes, represent blood-and-bones Detroit, a city whose greatest resource is asphalt?"<ref name="Klosterman2" /> However, in 2001, Benjamin Nugent with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine commented that "it's hard to begrudge [Jack] his right to nudge the spotlight toward his band, and away from his private life, by any means available. Even at the expense of the truth."<ref name="nugent">Nugent, Benjamin (June 16, 2001).
