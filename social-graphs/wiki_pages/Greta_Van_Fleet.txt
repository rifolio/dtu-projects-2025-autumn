==History==
===Formation and early years (2012–2015)===
The band was formed in 2012 in [[Frankenmuth, Michigan]] by twin brothers Josh and Jake Kiszka, their younger brother Sam, and Kyle Hauck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/saginaw/index.ssf/2014/06/local_lowdown_greta_van_fleet.html|title=Here's the lowdown on Frankenmuth band Greta Van Fleet|last=White|first=Sue|date=June 6, 2014|website=Mlive.com|access-date=April 27, 2017|archive-date=June 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611021953/http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/saginaw/index.ssf/2014/06/local_lowdown_greta_van_fleet.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Creating a band had always been Jake Kiszka's dream; he joined his high school band to further that goal, where he eventually met Hauck.
