On April 27, 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that Five Finger Death Punch's record label [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]] had filed a lawsuit against the band on April 21, 2016, for breaching their contract.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Kaufman |first1=Gil|title=Five Finger Death Punch Sued By Label Over New Album, Greatest Hits|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7348340/five-finger-death-punch-sued-by-label-new-album-greatest-hits|magazine=Billboard|date=April 27, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2022}}</ref> The basis of the claim cites that the band began working on a new album without Prospect Park's consent and will be working with [[Rise Records]].

However, during a concert in the Netherlands, Moody did not show up to perform the first song, which was sung by [[Tommy Vext]], with Moody saying he was running "a little bit late". Vext also sang a second song during the set later in the evening while Moody walked off stage. During the show all of the members left the stage for long periods on several occasions, and Hook also threw his guitar down and walked offstage at one point. During the set, Moody said that "there is no other singer for Five Finger Death Punch", and then later said "This is my last show with Five Finger Death Punch" before making a slit-throat gesture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/71619/news-ivan-moody-calls-tilburg-his-last-show-in-five-finger-death-punch|title=News: Ivan Moody calls Tilburg his "last show" in Five Finger Death Punch!|website=Deadpress.co.uk|date=June 13, 2017|access-date=October 28, 2017|archive-date=July 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729014758/http://www.deadpress.co.uk/71619/news-ivan-moody-calls-tilburg-his-last-show-in-five-finger-death-punch|url-status=dead}}</ref> Bathory shortly after the show tweeted that the events that transpired were "not a publicity stunt."<ref>{{cite tweet|user=ZoltanBathory |first=Zoltan|last=Bathory|number=874454610941026306|date=June 13, 2017|title=No dude not a publicity stunt.
