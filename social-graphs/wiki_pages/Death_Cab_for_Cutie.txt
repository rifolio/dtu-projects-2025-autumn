The band's fourth album, 2003's ''[[Transatlanticism]]'', broke into the mainstream both critically and commercially; its songs were featured in various TV series and films. The band's major label debut for [[Atlantic Records]], 2005's ''[[Plans (album)|Plans]]'', went [[platinum certification|platinum]]. Founding guitarist [[Chris Walla]] left the band in 2014 after 17 years. The band's tenth and latest studio album, ''[[Asphalt Meadows]]'', was released on September 16, 2022. Alongside their ten full-length studio albums, the band has released four [[Extended Play|EPs]], two live EPs, one [[live album]], and one demo album.

Gibbard took the band name from the song "[[Death Cab for Cutie (song)|Death Cab for Cutie]]", which was written by [[Neil Innes]] and [[Vivian Stanshall]] and recorded by their group the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]]. The song is a track on the Bonzo's 1967 debut album, ''[[Gorilla (Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band album)|Gorilla]]'', and was performed by them in the Beatles film ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''. The title was originally that of a story in an old [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction crime magazine]] that Innes came across in a street market. In a 2011 interview, Gibbard stated, "The name was never supposed to be something that someone was going to reference 15 years on. So yeah, I would absolutely go back and give it a more obvious name."<ref>{{cite web |last=O'Connor |first=Rod |date=August 23, 2011 |title=Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard – Interview |url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/death-cab-for-cuties-ben-gibbard-interview |access-date=January 26, 2015 |publisher=Time Out Chicago}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Early years (1997–2002) ===
Death Cab for Cutie, the name deriving from the [[Vivian Stanshall]]/[[Neil Innes]] song "[[Death Cab for Cutie (song)|Death Cab For Cutie]]", began in 1997 as a solo project by [[Ben Gibbard]] when he was a guitarist for the band Pinwheel. He recorded under the name [[All-Time Quarterback]]. As Death Cab for Cutie, he released a cassette, ''[[You Can Play These Songs with Chords]]'', during the same year. The release was surprisingly successful, and he decided to expand the project into a band, hiring [[Chris Walla]] (who worked on the cassette) on guitar, Nick Harmer on bass guitar, and [[Nathan Good]] on drums.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |title=Death Cab for Cutie |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p365455|pure_url=yes}}| website=Allmusic|year=2005|access-date=February 15, 2008}}</ref> Death Cab for Cutie was formed at [[Western Washington University]] in [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Lyrics from early songs include local references that were important to the band's development.<ref name="washington post">{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Richard|title=Death Cab, Full Speed Ahead| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/20/AR2005102000645_pf.html |newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] |date= October 21, 2005 |access-date= February 15, 2008}}</ref> Many of the early songs were recorded in the basement of a house on Ellis Street in which Gibbard lived with several roommates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shank|first=Craig|title=George Drake's Interview with Chris Walla|url=http://wiux.org/new/2006/12/12/interview-with-chris-walla-guitarist-and-producer-of-death-cab-for-cutie/|publisher=[[WIUX-LP]]|date=December 12, 2006|access-date=February 15, 2008|url-status= dead| archive-url= https://archive.today/20120716095253/http://wiux.org/new/2006/12/12/interview-with-chris-walla-guitarist-and-producer-of-death-cab-for-cutie/| archive-date= July 16, 2012| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The four released their debut album, ''[[Something About Airplanes]]'', on August 18, 1998. In 1998, the band met their manager, [[Jordan Kurland]]. Kurland had heard the band praised, and after a failed attempt to see them perform at [[South by Southwest]] he met them while touring with a client.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JordanKurland.html |title=Interview With Jordan Kurland |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=October 26, 2005 |access-date=June 30, 2010}}</ref>

The band released ''[[We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes]]'' in March 2000. Nathan Good left the band during the making of the album and was replaced briefly by Jayson Tolzdorf-Larson. Gibbard played drums on the majority of the album, with Good's playing on "The Employment Pages" and "Company Calls Epilogue" kept on the final release.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Although Tolzdorf-Larson did not contribute to the album, he did appear on the song "Spring Break Broke" from the "Death Cab for Fiver" 7-inch record. He also joined the band on two tours, including their first full tour of the United States. Tolzdorf-Larson was later replaced by [[Michael Schorr]], who would first appear on ''[[The Forbidden Love EP]]'', released on October 24, 2000.

In 2001, Death Cab for Cutie released their third album, ''[[The Photo Album]]''. Limited editions of this album contained three bonus tracks, which were later released separately as ''[[The Stability EP]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=CD REVIEW: Death Cab for Cutie's 'Something About Airplanes' |work=[[Daily Trojan]]| date= April 12, 1999|last=Young|first=Ian }}</ref> The album produced the band's first charting single, "[[A Movie Script Ending]]", which reached number 123 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and was the first of three songs by the band to be used on the television show ''[[The O.C.]]'' "I Was a Kaleidoscope" and "We Laugh Indoors" reached numbers 115 and 122 on the UK Singles Chart, respectively.

=== Transatlanticism (2003) ===
In 2003 there was another change of drummer with [[Jason McGerr]], who had previously played in the band [[Eureka Farm]] with Gibbard and Harmer, joining the band. McGerr's debut came with the band's next release, their fourth album ''[[Transatlanticism]]'',<ref name="Allmusic"/> which was released in October 2003.<ref name="Allmusic"/> The album received critical acclaim and launched the band into mainstream commercial success, with the two singles "[[The Sound of Settling]]" and "[[Title and Registration]]", appearing in the soundtracks of the television shows ''[[The O.C.]]'',<ref name="washington post"/> ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'', and the films ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', ''[[Easy A]]'', and ''[[Mean Creek]]''.

Death Cab for Cutie had been contacted by major labels on-and-off for several years, but it was only after the proven success of ''Transatlanticism'' that they decided to start talking to labels about a potential deal.

Generally, the band's sound is characterized by "sensitive songwriting [and] memorable melodies." Ben Gibbard's vocals are described as "rich [and] wistful."<ref name=":0" /> The band's early work on ''[[You Can Play These Songs with Chords]]'' was described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as "emotion through its lack of emotion".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/deathcabforcutie/albums/album/264646/review/5943192/you_can_play_these_songs_with_chords |title=Death Cab for Cutie – You Can Play These Songs with Chords|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=Jenny|last=Eliscu|date=November 14, 2002|access-date=July 21, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621234046/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/deathcabforcutie/albums/album/264646/review/5943192/you_can_play_these_songs_with_chords |archive-date = June 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] also remarked that the work on the cassette was "ultra-lo-fi".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16921-you-can-play-these-songs-with-chords |title=Death Cab for Cutie: You Can Play These Songs with Chords |publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |first=Rob|last=Mitchum |date=November 25, 2002 |access-date=July 21, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621165226/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/16921-you-can-play-these-songs-with-chords |archive-date=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> On ''[[Something About Airplanes]]'' the band's style remained similar, with some new instrumental work introduced; "[[flute]], [[Synthesizer|synth]], or [[cello]]" were noted by [[AllMusic]]'s Nitsuh Abebe.<ref>{{cite web|url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r397557|pure_url=yes}} |title = Something About Airplanes > Overview|publisher = Allmusic|first=Nitsuh|last=Abebe|access-date = July 21, 2008}}</ref> On ''[[We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes]]'' the band again expanded their use of unorthodox instruments, including [[organ (music)|organ]] and [[glockenspiel]].

In an interview with [[Shave (magazine)|Shave Magazine]], Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he "never sit[s] down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I'm writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it has more to do with the fact that just what's been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision."<ref name="shavemagazine">{{cite web |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/interview-death-cab-for-cutie/5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007033217/http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/interview-death-cab-for-cutie/5 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 7, 2011 |title=Interview: Death Cab for Cutie |work=[[Shave (magazine)|Shave Magazine]] |first=Bobby |last=Gorman |access-date=June 21, 2011 }}</ref>
