'''Skid Row''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in 1986 in [[Toms River, New Jersey]]. Their current lineup comprises bassist [[Rachel Bolan]], guitarists [[Dave Sabo]] and [[Scotti Hill]] and drummer Rob Hammersmith. The group achieved commercial success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with its first two albums ''[[Skid Row (Skid Row album)|Skid Row]]'' (1989) and ''[[Slave to the Grind]]'' (1991) certified multi-platinum, the latter of which reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Those two albums also produced some of Skid Row's most popular hits, both in and outside of the United States, including "[[18 and Life]]" and "[[I Remember You (Skid Row song)|I Remember You]]", which peaked in the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and other charting singles such as "[[Youth Gone Wild]]", "[[Monkey Business (Skid Row song)|Monkey Business]]", "[[Slave to the Grind (song)|Slave to the Grind]]", "[[Wasted Time (Skid Row song)|Wasted Time]]", and "[[In a Darkened Room]]". The band's third album ''[[Subhuman Race]]'' (1995) was also critically acclaimed, but failed to repeat the success of its predecessors. Those three albums featured the band's "classic" lineup, which consisted of Bolan, Sabo, Hill, drummer [[Rob Affuso]] and frontman [[Sebastian Bach]]. The band had sold 20 million albums worldwide by the end of 1996. Amid rising tensions, Bach was fired and Affuso left Skid Row towards the end of that year, after which the band entered a three-year hiatus.

Skid Row reformed in 1999, with [[Johnny Solinger]], formerly of Solinger, as Bach's replacement and a revolving cast of drummers, the latest being Rob Hammersmith. Solinger recorded two studio albums with the band – ''[[Thickskin]]'' (2003) and ''[[Revolutions per Minute (Skid Row album)|Revolutions per Minute]]'' (2006) – as well as the EPs [[United World Rebellion|''United World Rebellion: Chapter One'' and ''Rise of the Damnation Army – United World Rebellion: Chapter Two'']] (2013 and 2014 respectively); those recordings garnered mixed reception. In April 2015, Skid Row parted ways with Solinger, and replaced him with then-former [[TNT (Norwegian band)|TNT]] singer [[Tony Harnell]]. Eight months later, however, Harnell left the band. In January 2017, former [[DragonForce]] vocalist [[ZP Theart]] was named the official lead singer after spending a year as a touring member of the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/skid-row-officially-recruits-ex-dragonforce-singer-zp-theart-prepares-to-make-new-record/|title=SKID ROW Officially Recruits Ex-DRAGONFORCE Singer ZP THEART, Prepares To Make New Record|date=January 15, 2017|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=September 27, 2019|archive-date=September 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190927155443/https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/skid-row-officially-recruits-ex-dragonforce-singer-zp-theart-prepares-to-make-new-record/|url-status=live}}</ref> Theart remained with Skid Row until March 2022, when the band replaced him with [[Erik Grönwall]], who debuted on their first studio album in 16 years, ''[[The Gang's All Here (Skid Row album)|The Gang's All Here]]'', which was released in October 2022. Grönwall left Skid Row in March 2024 due to health issues, as he had to prioritize full recovery after receiving treatment for [[leukemia]], and [[Lzzy Hale]] of [[Halestorm]] had filled in for him on live dates before leaving on her own.<ref>{{cite web|title=Erik Grönwall lämnar Skid Row: "Respekterar min hälsa" |url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/eJlWEy/erik-gronwall-lamnar-skid-row-pa-grund-av-halsoskal |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=March 27, 2024 |access-date=March 27, 2024 }}

==History==
===Early years (1986–1988)===
Skid Row was formed in 1986 in [[Toms River, New Jersey]], by bassist [[Rachel Bolan]] and guitarist [[Dave Sabo]].<ref name="AM">{{cite web|last=Weber|first=Barry|title=Skid Row Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/skid-row-mn0000026367/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=June 2, 2016|archive-date=March 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313053243/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/skid-row-mn0000026367/biography|url-status=live}}</ref> The pair recruited guitarist [[Scotti Hill]] and drummer [[Rob Affuso]] through newspaper ads.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Black|first=Lee|title=Born to Be Wild|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msdh3F68Q44C&q=skid+row+band&pg=PA46|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=December 1989|pages=45–47|access-date=November 21, 2020|archive-date=February 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212072715/https://books.google.com/books?id=msdh3F68Q44C&q=skid+row+band&pg=PA46|url-status=live}}</ref> Lead vocalist [[Sebastian Bach]] replaced original singer Matt Fallon after the band spotted Bach singing at rock photographer [[Mark Weiss]]'s wedding at the age of 18, and the members asked him to join in early 1987. Bolan claimed in a 2020 interview on the Chuck Shute Podcast that, before settling with Bach on vocals, future [[Mötley Crüe]] singer [[John Corabi]] auditioned for Skid Row.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rachel Bolan recalls John Corabi blowing off auditioning for Skid Row|url=https://sleazeroxx.com/rachel-bolan-recalls-john-corabi-blowing-off-auditioning-for-skid-row/|website=Sleazeroxx.com|date=October 14, 2020|access-date=October 14, 2020|archive-date=October 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018053255/https://sleazeroxx.com/rachel-bolan-recalls-john-corabi-blowing-off-auditioning-for-skid-row/|url-status=live}}</ref> The band began playing shows in clubs throughout the eastern United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Sabo and [[Jon Bon Jovi]] were teenage friends and Sabo was briefly a member of [[Bon Jovi]] before being replaced by guitarist [[Richie Sambora]]. Sabo and Bon Jovi agreed that if one of them made it in the music business, he would help the other. Bon Jovi's manager [[Doc McGhee]] sought out Skid Row and secured the band a record deal with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1988.<ref name="AM"/> Skid Row recorded its debut album ''[[Skid Row (Skid Row album)|Skid Row]]'' at the Royal Recorders in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin with producer [[Michael Wagener]]. Before releasing the album, the management paid a reported $35,000 to guitarist [[Gary Moore]] for the rights to the name of his [[Skid Row (Irish band)|original band]].<ref name="Ultimate">{{cite web|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|title=How Terrible Timing Obscured Skid Row's Promise|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/skid-row-first-album/|publisher=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|date=January 24, 2016|access-date=June 2, 2016|archive-date=May 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520111318/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/skid-row-first-album/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===''Skid Row'' and ''Slave to the Grind'' (1989–1992)===
The band's debut album ''[[Skid Row (Skid Row album)|Skid Row]]'', released in January 1989, was an instant success. The record went 5× platinum on the strength of three singles: "[[Youth Gone Wild]]", "[[18 and Life]]" and "[[I Remember You (Skid Row song)|I Remember You]]", the latter two becoming Top 10 hits. Skid Row supported the album by opening for Bon Jovi on their ''[[New Jersey (album)|New Jersey]]'' [[New Jersey Syndicate Tour|tour]]. As part of the six-month tour, Skid Row played its first-ever UK gig supporting Bon Jovi's outdoor show at [[National Bowl|Milton Keynes Bowl]] on August 19, 1989. The next day, Skid Row played a successful club show at London's [[Marquee Club]] in [[Charing Cross Road]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ling|first=Dave|title=Skid Row: "It didn't matter what we did, it wasn't our time any more"|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2003-12-10/skid-row-it-didn-t-matter-what-we-did-it-wasn-t-our-time-anymore|work=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|date=December 10, 2003|access-date=June 4, 2016|archive-date=June 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613110904/http://teamrock.com/feature/2003-12-10/skid-row-it-didn-t-matter-what-we-did-it-wasn-t-our-time-anymore|url-status=live}}</ref> Skid Row also took part in the [[Moscow Music Peace Festival]], which was set up to keep McGhee out of jail. McGhee was facing drug trafficking charges, and therefore set up an anti-drug/peace concert in Russia, featuring a few of the artists that he and his brother managed.<ref>{{cite web |title=That Time Western Rockers Played the Moscow Music Peace Festival |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/moscow-music-peace-festival/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=August 12, 2015 |access-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621114933/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/moscow-music-peace-festival/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Skid Row returned to the UK three months later, opening for Mötley Crüe on their European ''[[Dr. Feelgood (album)|Dr. Feelgood]]'' world tour in early November 1989 with [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Mötley Crüe's Concert & Tour History |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/motley-crue?page=7 |website=Concert Archives |access-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-date=February 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212072717/https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/motley-crue?page=7 |url-status=live }}</ref> That was followed by a UK headlining tour culminating in a show at London's [[Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]], with [[Vain (band)|Vain]] supporting.<ref>{{cite web |title=20 Questions with Vain singer Davy Vain |url=http://metalsludge.tv/classic/?p=30762 |website=Metal Sludge |access-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-date=February 6, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230206051136/https://metalsludge.tv/classic/?p=30762 |url-status=live }}</ref> Skid Row continued touring into 1990, including supporting [[Aerosmith]] on the North American leg of their ''[[Pump (album)|Pump]]'' [[Pump Tour|tour]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1989-1990 Pump Tour - Aerosmith Temple |url=http://www.aerosmithtemple.com/1989-1990-pump-tour |website=Aerosmith Temple |access-date=July 9, 2019 |archive-date=July 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709215343/http://www.aerosmithtemple.com/1989-1990-pump-tour |url-status=live }}</ref>

In what is referred to as "The Bottle Incident" by fans of the band, Bach was hit onstage with a bottle thrown from the crowd at a concert in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], where Skid Row was opening for [[Aerosmith]] on December 27, 1989. Bach threw the bottle back, hitting a girl (not the thrower), then he jumped on the crowd to beat the person who can be seen on a tour video released by Skid Row called ''[[Oh Say Can You Scream]]'' in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sebastian Bach Arrested After Bottling Incident |url=http://loudwire.com/onstage-blows-to-the-head-sebastian-bach/ |website=Loudwire |access-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622123900/https://loudwire.com/onstage-blows-to-the-head-sebastian-bach/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Shortly thereafter, at another show, Bach put on a T-shirt proclaiming the [[Anti-LGBT rhetoric|anti-gay slogan]] "[[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] Kills Fags Dead"<ref>{{cite web |title=Homophobia In Metal?

The shirt was previously given to him by a fan, as Bach was seen wearing the year prior. On MTV News Bach dismissed the controversy saying "I don't see what the big deal is really but I guess if someone wore a T-shirt saying 'Cancer Kills Grandmas Dead' I'd probably be a little bit pissed too."<ref>{{cite web |title=Kurt Loder Talks Sebastian Bach's Controversial AIDS T-Shirt, Gay Marriage |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kurt-loder-sebastian-bach_n_3298963 |website=Huffington Post |date=May 18, 2013 |access-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-date=October 4, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221004114039/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kurt-loder-sebastian-bach_n_3298963 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bach eventually expressed regret over the incident, claiming that he did not read the slogan before putting the shirt on, even though he wore it for a photo shoot in ''[[Metal Edge]]'' magazine.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} The band also recorded a cover of the [[Sex Pistols]]' "[[Holidays in the Sun (song)|Holidays in the Sun]]" for the [[Make A Difference]] Foundation release ''[[Moscow_Music_Peace_Festival#Album|Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Make a Difference Foundation: Stairway to Heaven/Highway to Hell |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/make-a-difference-foundation-stairway-to-heaven-%C2%B0highway-to-hell-mw0000654390 |website=AllMusic |access-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622125358/https://www.allmusic.com/album/make-a-difference-foundation-stairway-to-heaven-%25C2%25B0highway-to-hell-mw0000654390 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Skid Row returned to the studio with Wagener in 1990 to record its second studio album ''[[Slave to the Grind]]''. The album was released in June 1991 and debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], reaching 2× platinum status without any radio hits.<ref name="AM"/> It was a departure for the band; while ''Skid Row'' was an album that followed the typical 1980s band formula, ''Slave to the Grind'' had a heavier sound. Skid Row once again went out on a worldwide tour that lasted over a year, including a leg supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] in 1991 and an appearance at [[Monsters of Rock]] in [[Castle Donington]] in 1992. The band then took out [[Pantera]], [[Soundgarden]], [[L.A. Guns]] and [[Love/Hate (band)|Love/Hate]] as supporting acts as part of the tour supporting ''Slave to the Grind''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sebastian Bach Says Pantera Was 'Craziest' Band To Tour With |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sebastian-bach-says-pantera-was-craziest-band-to-tour-with/ |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=September 18, 2015 |access-date=June 23, 2019 |archive-date=June 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190623131828/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sebastian-bach-says-pantera-was-craziest-band-to-tour-with/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sleazeroxx.com/tracii-guns-claims-that-he-fired-steve-riley-from-l-a-guns-back-in-1992-for-hitting-phil-lewis/|title=Tracii Guns claims that he fired Steve Riley from L.A.

An EP of covers ''[[B-Side Ourselves]]'' was released in September 1992. Not only does the EP include cover versions of songs originally recorded by artists that had influenced Skid Row, but it is essentially a compilation of tracks that had previously appeared as B-sides of the ''Slave to the Grind''-era singles, while its closing track – the cover version of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "[[Little Wing]]" – had never appeared elsewhere. ''B-Side Ourselves'' peaked at number 58 on the ''Billboard'' 200 (Skid Row's lowest chart position to date),<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/skid-row/chart-history/tlp/|title=B-Side Ourselves Chart History|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]]|access-date=August 12, 2021|archive-date=November 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211117145722/https://www.billboard.com/artist/skid-row/chart-history/tlp/|url-status=live}}</ref> and it was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] approximately six months after its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Skid+Row&ti=B-Side+Ourselves&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|website=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA.com]]|access-date=August 12, 2021|archive-date=August 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210812144900/https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Skid+Row&ti=B-Side+Ourselves&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although the album did not achieve the success of its predecessors, it received mixed to positive reviews and has also been viewed as Skid Row's darkest album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://somethingelsereviews.com/2020/04/03/skid-row-subhuman-race/|title=Why Metal Fans Should Give Skid Row's 'Subhuman Race' a Second Chance|date=April 3, 2020|website=Somethingelsereviews.com|access-date=January 31, 2022|archive-date=February 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220201023704/https://somethingelsereviews.com/2020/04/03/skid-row-subhuman-race/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/reviews/cd_3/s_2/skid-row-the.htm|title=Skid Row – The Atlantic Years (1989-1996) review|website=Metal-temple.com|access-date=January 31, 2022|archive-date=February 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220201023634/http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/reviews/cd_3/s_2/skid-row-the.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> As of 2019, the band rarely plays any songs from ''Subhuman Race'' live; most of them were last performed on the album's tour in 1995, while "Beat Yourself Blind" is the only song they have played live with its subsequent singers [[Johnny Solinger]] and [[ZP Theart]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Skid Row Tour Statistics|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/skid-row-63d69e63.html|website=Setlist.fm|access-date=August 11, 2018|archive-date=August 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811195744/https://www.setlist.fm/stats/skid-row-63d69e63.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

At that point, the band shifted to performing at smaller venues and its videos were rarely played on [[MTV]], partly because of the rise in popularity of grunge and the subsequent decline of the 1980s style of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Skid Row was the opening act for [[Van Halen]] on the North American leg of their ''[[Balance (Van Halen album)|Balance]]'' tour. Eventually, Bach was fired from the band in late 1996 after an argument with Bolan who turned down an opening slot on the [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] reunion tour even though Bach had already booked it. The other band members told Bach that Skid Row was too big to be an opening act and that they were not going to do the show. Bach, a Kiss fan, then left a message on Snake's answering machine telling them the band would never be too big to open for Kiss along with a number of insults; this resulted in Snake telling Bach that he would never work with him again.<ref>{{cite web |title=SEBASTIAN BACH On His Split From SKID ROW - "I Was 100% Fired From the Band" |url=http://bravewords.com/news/sebastian-bach-on-his-split-from-skid-row-i-was-100-fired-from-the-band |website=Bravewords.com |access-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-date=June 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622130333/http://bravewords.com/news/sebastian-bach-on-his-split-from-skid-row-i-was-100-fired-from-the-band |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Dangerous Toys]] vocalist Jason McMaster revealed in a May 2020 interview on ''The Chuck Shute Podcast'' that, during this period, he was approached by Sabo and Bolan to audition for Skid Row as Bach's replacement, but turned it down as he was "just not a huge fan" and "was trying to get Toys back on the road." McMaster also recalled: "Sebastian was gone, so whatever year he was gone [is when they got in touch with me]. When he left, and here's a campfire, and Snake and Rachel are sitting around: 'Well, who do we wanna try out?' And my name was on the list."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dangerous-toys-singer-jason-mcmaster-says-he-turned-down-chances-to-audition-for-pantera-and-skid-row/|title=DANGEROUS TOYS Singer JASON MCMASTER Says He Turned Down Chances To Audition For PANTERA And SKID ROW|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=May 6, 2020|date=May 5, 2020|archive-date=May 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200506160023/https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dangerous-toys-singer-jason-mcmaster-says-he-turned-down-chances-to-audition-for-pantera-and-skid-row/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 2023, Sabo revealed that Skid Row has begun writing new material for their seventh studio album: "There's four potential songs for the next record already. And who knows whether they'll make it or not. We've never done that before. So that's kind of where everybody's head is at. We're really staying in the moment, but we're also utilizing this newfound energy, shall I say, to be really creative and productive."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/skid-row-is-already-working-on-material-for-next-studio-album-theres-four-potential-songs-says-dave-snake-sabo | title=SKID ROW is Already Working on Material for Next Studio Album: 'There's Four Potential Songs', Says DAVE 'SNAKE' SABO|website=Blabbermouth.net | date=March 7, 2023 }}</ref>

May 2023 saw Skid Row attempt to embark on an Australian tour, however it was fraught with problems - the May 17 show in Brisbane was abruptly canceled minutes before the doors were to open, with Grönwall coming down with flu-like symptoms. The band were able to complete their Sydney tour date on the 19th, however Grönwall's symptoms worsened and eventually the whole tour ended up being postponed.

On March 27, 2024, after finishing the postponed shows, which ended in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]], the band announced that they had parted ways with Grönwall due to health issues, and that several of their upcoming shows would feature [[Lzzy Hale]] on vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/skid-row-parts-ways-with-singer-erik-gronwall|title=SKID ROW Parts Ways With Singer ERIK GRÖNWALL|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=March 27, 2024|access-date=March 27, 2024}}</ref> Hale performed four shows with Skid Row in the United States but stated that she would not be joining the band full-time.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/halestorm-lzzy-hale-not-joining-skid-row-full-time-2024| title=Halestorm's Lzzy Hale isn't joining Skid Row full-time: "This particular time in my life prevents me from committing"| date=June 3, 2024 |author=Matt Mills|work=Metal Hammer}}</ref>
