Adams dropped out of school at age 15. He has said that his worst period of [[drug abuse]] including [[Alcoholism|alcohol]] occurred before his 16th birthday.

Adams attributes the pockmarks on his face to his drug use.<ref name="guard" />

Adams did not see his father for a period of 12 years following his parents' divorce. He later reconciled with him.<ref name="guard" />

On September 24, 1991, the album ''[[Waking Up the Neighbours]]'' was released.

The album caused controversy in Canada due to the [[Canadian content]] system, as the album was largely recorded in England and co-produced by [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]], originally from [[Zambia]], making it not Canadian by the rules in effect at the time.<ref name=CRTCdebate>{{cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1734701249 | title=CRTC debate: Bryan Adams not Canadian? | publisher=[[CBC News]] | date=January 14, 1992 | access-date=January 23, 2024 | archive-date=January 23, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240123021122/https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1734701249 | url-status=live }}</ref> Following Adams' complaints, in September of that year, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) announced that the [[Canadian content]] rules would be expanded. The regulation at that time considered collaborative writing between Canadians and non-Canadians to be "Canadian" only where the lyricist and musical composer worked separately and at least one was Canadian. In protest, Adams briefly threatened to boycott Canada's annual [[Juno Awards]], where his album was eventually almost completely ignored by the awards committee. In 1992, he won the [[Juno International Achievement Award]], [[Canadian Entertainer of the Year]] (voted on by the public) and [[Jack Richardson Producer of the Year Award|Producer of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://junoawards.ca/awards/past-winners-nominees/page/2/?tag_search_val=Bryan%20Adams&submit=submit | title=PAST NOMINEES + WINNERS | publisher=[[Juno Awards]] | access-date=January 23, 2024 | archive-date=January 23, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240123021122/https://junoawards.ca/awards/past-winners-nominees/page/2/?tag_search_val=Bryan%20Adams&submit=submit | url-status=live }}</ref> In September 1991, the regulation was amended to recognize collaborations in which two (or more) contributors each contributed to both lyrics and music, as was the case with Adams and Lange.

In addition to "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It For You]]", the album included "[[Can't Stop This Thing We Started]]" (number two in the US and number one in Canada), the ballad "[[Do I Have to Say the Words?]]" (number 11 in the US and in the UK and number one in Canada), "[[Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven]]" (number 8 in the U.S.), and "[[There Will Never Be Another Tonight]]" (number 2 in Canada).

Adams, while writing this song, did not think it would be performed by Aretha. He conceived something like a hymn and "so that it can express a sense of faith, and that even if you have lost something, there will always be an inner light to guide you." However, then Adams said:<blockquote>"When the song was ready, I told the producers that Aretha was going to sing it â€“ and she did. This solo version had been on my computer for years (about 15 years), and when I heard that the creative director of Sony Music, longtime producer and friend of Aretha's Clive Davis, was making a movie about his life, I sent him this version. The world hadn't heard her full performance yet and it really needed to be heard. I'm so glad it's being released, the world needs this right now."<ref name="Rolling Stone" /></blockquote>

During the first few years of his career, Adams fronted [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[glam rock]] band [[Sweeney Todd (band)|Sweeney Todd]]; the band played [[hard rock]] as well as [[glam rock]].<ref name="Sweeney Todd" />

The melody, a piano riff inspired by [[Robbie King (musician)|Robbie King]], was composed by Jim Vallance on his parents' piano during the Christmas holidays in 1977; Adams helped turn the riff into a song. 

In 1982, Vallance and Adams received a call from producer Michael James Jackson to contribute some songs for the next [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] album. Although Vallance and Adams were not fans of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], it was a golden opportunity for exposure for their songs by a world-class rock group. In collaboration with [[Gene Simmons]], the track "War Machine" and a rewrite "Rock 'n Roll Hell" were recorded by Kiss for the album ''[[Creatures of the Night]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/songs-folder-may-27/pg-song-kiss-war-machine.html|title=War Machine by Kiss|work=jimvallance.com|access-date=December 6, 2020|archive-date=August 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204212/http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/songs-folder-may-27/pg-song-kiss-war-machine.html|url-status=live}}</ref>{{better source|date=May 2025}}

In the 1990s, with the release of ''Waking Up the Neighbours'' in 1991, produced by [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]], Adams left the hard rock sound and released an album closer to classic rock and roll, taking inspiration from the sounds of bands like [[Def Leppard]] and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/albums-folder/pg-album-adams-06-waking-up.html |title=Waking Up the Neighbors by Bryan Adams |work=jimvallance.com |archive-date=June 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614183826/http://www.jimvallance.com/01-music-folder/albums-folder/pg-album-adams-07-wak.html |url-status=live}}</ref>{{better source|date=May 2025}} In 1996, with his album ''[[18 til I Die]]'', Adams adopted a pop rock sound more in line with the style of the time.

In the album ''[[Room Service (Bryan Adams album)|Room Service]]'' (2000), Adams again opted for a rock-orientated sound.
