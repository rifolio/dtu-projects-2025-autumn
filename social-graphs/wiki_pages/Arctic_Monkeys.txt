Reflektor Magazine had the following to say about the album in a review, "After five years of silence, the Arctic Monkeys make their much-awaited return with surprising and hypnotic ''Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino''. Perfectly managing to avoid self-parody or stylistic repetitions, this new album appears as a startling reinvention, a meandering and puzzling journey beyond known territories. Just like mankind first set foot on the moon on the 'Tranquility base' site, the Arctic Monkeys disembark in an unknown universe in which they reveal a new, unexpected aspect of themselves.".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reflektormag.com/post/174279710679/three-point-perspective-arctic-monkeys|title=Reflektor – Three Point Perspective: Arctic Monkeys...|work=Reflektor|access-date=9 June 2018}}</ref>
