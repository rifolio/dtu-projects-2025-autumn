Further releases ''[[Elevator (The Rollers album)|Elevator]]'' (1979) and ''[[Voxx (album)|Voxx]]'' (1980) made little impact on international charts. They returned to chart prominence in the 2000s and 2010s with the release of a series of compilation albums – ''The Very Best of'' (2004), ''The Greatest Hits'' (2010) and ''Gold'' (2019), all of which reached the top twenty in the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web |title=BAY CITY ROLLERS |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17062/bay-city-rollers/ |website=Official Charts |access-date=3 July 2025 |language=en |date=18 September 1971}}</ref> and the top ten on the [[Scottish Singles and Albums Charts|national albums charts]] in their native Scotland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Scottish Albums Chart on 29/8/2010 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/scottish-albums-chart/20100829/40/ |website=Official Charts |access-date=3 July 2025 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Official Scottish Albums Chart on 11/4/2004 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/scottish-albums-chart/20040411/40/ |website=Official Charts |access-date=3 July 2025 |language=en}}</ref>

Despite their international prominence during the 1970s and early 1980s, the Bay City Rollers never made the transition from [[boy band]], as their members aged, and their career was marked by financial difficulties and mismanagement. Several members accused manager [[Tam Paton]] of sexual assault, but no charges were laid. The current line-up (since 2018) includes rhythm guitarist Stuart "Woody" Wood, the only member to appear on all of the band's studio albums, vocalist and lead guitarist Ian Thomson, bassist Mikey Smith, keyboardist John McLaughlin and drummer Jamie McGrory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thebaycityrollers.co.uk|title=BAY CITY ROLLERS – OFFICIAL WEBSITE|website=baycityrollers.co.uk|access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref>

In 1964, a trio called the Ambassadors was formed in [[Edinburgh]], the capital city of Scotland, by 16-year-old [[Alan Longmuir]] on acoustic guitar, his younger brother [[Derek Longmuir]] on drums, and their older cousin Neil Porteous on acoustic guitar. The group never performed publicly under this name,<ref name=Spence2016>{{cite book |last1=Spence |first1=Simon |title=When The Screaming Stops: The Dark History of the Bay City Rollers |date=2016 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |isbn=9781783237050 |pages=33–35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66A2DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT33}}</ref> just a family wedding where they covered "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]". They changed their name to the Saxons, and Derek invited a friend from school, Gordon "Nobby" Clark, to be the lead singer. Porteous moved from acoustic to electric guitar, and Alan Longmuir followed suit by changing to electric bass.<ref name=Coy2005>Coy, W. (2005), ''Bay City Babylon: The Unbelievable But True Story of the Bay City Rollers'', pp 12–13. Hats Off Books, {{ISBN|978-1587364631}}</ref> The Saxons played occasional dance hall concerts while the band members completed their schooling or worked during the day (Alan apprenticed as a plumber). Porteous left the band in July 1965, with new guitarist Dave Pettigrew filling the spot after answering an advertisement placed by the band in an Edinburgh newspaper. Pettigrew was more advanced musically than the others, and pushed the band to improve. Their repertoire included American R&B/pop songs such as "[[Please Mr. Postman]]" and "[[Heat Wave (Martha and the Vandellas song)|Heat Wave]]". They played at least one gig at the Gonk Club as the Deadbeats, but they discovered a conflict: Another band was playing locally as Rock Bottom and the Deadbeats.<ref name=Spence2016/>

While taking a technical class at Napier College, Alan met fellow plumbing student Gregory Ellison, who joined the Saxons on electric guitar, with Pettigrew shifting to keyboards. Gregory's older brother Mike joined as a second lead singer, allowing more complex harmonies, especially useful for the Motown songs they liked to perform. The band convinced [[Tam Paton]], a former [[big band]] leader<ref>{{cite web|last=Finney|first=Ritchie|title=Tam Paton Spills The Heinz Baked Beans!|url=http://www.spencemusic.co.uk/bilbomusic/articles/Tam/spilledbeans.htm|work=Bilbo Baggins Home Page|publisher=Morley Enterprises|access-date=31 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910180745/http://www.spencemusic.co.uk/bilbomusic/articles/Tam/spilledbeans.htm|archive-date=10 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and influential local band and club manager, to audition them at the Longmuirs' house. Paton booked them for a Thursday night at his club, the Palais, then assigned them to open for the Hipple People at Top Storey. More gigs followed.<ref name=Spence2016/>

More successful now, the Saxons moved out of the Longmuirs' back room to practice in Hermiston at a church. They played a couple of contemporary [[The Kinks|Kinks]] numbers but favored American songs, including a new one: "[[See See Rider|C.C. Rider]]" by [[Mitch Ryder]] and the Detroit Wheels. Desiring a better name for the band, they settled on "Rollers", but needed a more powerful American-sounding term in front of that. Derek Longmuir threw a dart at a map of the United States, landing first on Arkansas. This did not meet anyone's approval, so a second dart was thrown. It landed near [[Bay City, Michigan]]. The band agreed on the name, the Bay City Rollers.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

Clark recorded an additional two songs with the band which were released, ultimately becoming non-charting singles. Additionally, during this period, long-term member guitarist [[Eric Faulkner]] was added to the bands lineup.<ref name="Bay City Rollers' first singer claims it's his voice on the hit version of 'Saturday Night'">{{cite web |title=Bay City Rollers' first singer claims it's his voice on the hit version of 'Saturday Night' |url=https://www.goldradio.com/news/music/bay-city-rollers-nobby-clark-saturday-night/ |website=Gold Radio |access-date=5 July 2025 |language=en}}</ref> In mid-1973, they narrowly missed the [[UK Singles Chart]] with their fourth single, "[[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|Saturday Night]]". 

The band released the single "[[Remember (Sha-La-La-La)]]" which was given a "perfunctory release" in the United Kingdom as a consequence of the decision by [[Dick Leahy]], the manager of Bell Records, to drop the band from the label following its release.<ref name="When the Screaming Stops: the Dark History of the Bay City Rollers"/> Bell Records showed no real enthusiasm for the song, leaving the bands manager [[Tam Paton]] to visit Leahy and "beg him" to give the band "one last chance", later claiming that he believed Leahy only agreed to do so because he "felt sorry" for him.<ref name="When the Screaming Stops: the Dark History of the Bay City Rollers"/> Furthermore, by the end of 1972, Clark had become disillusioned with the band's musical direction and decided to leave the band. Despite the concerns from Bell Records over the future of the band and the decision by Clark to leave, "Remember (Sha-La-La-La)" reached its peak of number six on the singles charts in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Singles Chart on 3/3/1974 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19740303/7501/ |website=Official Charts |access-date=6 July 2025 |language=en |date=16 March 2020}}</ref> 

Given the success of the release, manager Tam Paton believed that Clark may change his decision about leaving the band, and "begged" him to appear with the band on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform the song.<ref name="When the Screaming Stops: the Dark History of the Bay City Rollers">{{cite book |last1=Spence |first1=Simon |title=When the Screaming Stops: the Dark History of the Bay City Rollers |date=2016 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=La Vergne |isbn=9781783237050 |edition=1st}}</ref> Whilst Clark agreed to do the performance on ''Top of the Pops'', Paton believed this was a signal that he had changed his mind about leaving the band, and was hopeful this would be the case for an upcoming show scheduled in [[Perth, Scotland]], however, Clark refused to perform at the concert and thereafter officially left the band.<ref name="When the Screaming Stops: the Dark History of the Bay City Rollers"/> As previously arranged between manager Tam Paton and departing frontman Gordon Clark, Clark had flown to [[London]] to appear in the recording for the ''Top of the Pops'' broadcast, but was later advised that a "special arrangement" had been made and that the segment had already been recorded without the involvement of Clark.<ref name="When the Screaming Stops: the Dark History of the Bay City Rollers"/> 

Clark was eventually replaced as the lead singer of the band by [[Les McKeown]], and a couple of months later, in early 1974, what became known as the classic line-up<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> was completed, with guitarist John Devine being replaced by Stuart "Woody" Wood. Clark had originally recorded lead vocals on "Saturday Night", however, after leaving the band and being replaced by McKeown, his vocals were removed and rerecorded by McKeown instead.<ref name="Bay City Rollers' first singer claims it's his voice on the hit version of 'Saturday Night'"/> The version of "Saturday Night" with Clark on lead vocals struggled to come to any release fruition, however, in contrast, McKeown's version achieved considerable commercial success, reaching number one on the United States [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Clark disputed the success of the McKeown version, claiming that it was his recording of "Saturday Night" that performed well commercially and that he was "long overdue royalties" from its success.<ref name="Bay City Rollers' first singer claims it's his voice on the hit version of 'Saturday Night'"/>

In 1987, Les McKeown was a guest on [[Jonathan Ross]]'s chat show where he told Ross that The Bay City Rollers did not perform on the first four singles.

[[File:Bay City Rollers on Toppop, 1974.png|thumb|left|Bay City Rollers perform "[[Summerlove Sensation]]" on Dutch television on ''[[TopPop]]'', 1974]] 
In late 1973, McKeown recorded lead vocals on "[[Remember (Sha-La-La-La)]]", marking the beginning of a period of commercial success for the band. It reached number six on the national singles charts in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number thirty-seven in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bay City Rollers - Remember - ultratop.be |url=https://www.ultratop.be/nl/song/58a4/Bay-City-Rollers-Remember |website=www.ultratop.be |access-date=5 July 2025}}</ref> In February 1974, 16-year-old Stuart Wood completed the "classic five" line-up, a week after the band had debuted the "Remember" single on ''Top of the Pops''. The "classic five" line-up consisted of: Alan Longmuir, Derek Longmuir, Stuart "Woody" Wood, Eric Faulkner and Les McKeown. Following the release of "Remember (Sha-La-La-La)" the bands popularity increased rapidly, releasing a series of commercially successful singles in the United Kingdom, including "[[Shang-a-Lang (song)|Shang-a-Lang]]", "[[Summerlove Sensation]]", and "All of Me Loves All of You".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> 

In October 1974, they released their debut album ''[[Rollin' (Bay City Rollers album)|Rollin']]'' to commercial success. It reached number one on the [[UK Albums Charts|albums charts]] in the United Kingdom,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17062/bay-city-rollers/ | title=BAY CITY ROLLERS &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company| website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]]}}</ref> and became the 16th best selling album of the year in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=27 December 1975 |title=Top Selling Albums For 1975 |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Music-Week/1975/Music-Week-1975-12-27.pdf |url-status=live |magazine=[[Music Week]] |page=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309074922/https://worldradiohistory.com/UK/Music-Week/1975/Music-Week-1975-12-27.pdf |archive-date=9 March 2021 |via=worldradiohistory.com}}</ref> Additionally, it performed well in international terriorities including Australia where it reached number eight,<ref name="AUS Albums">{{cite book|title=Australian Chart Book 1970–1992|title-link=Kent Music Report|last=Kent|first=David|publisher=Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|type=doc}}<!--|accessdate=2016-05-31--></ref> Finland where it reached number eighteen,<ref name="FINchart">{{cite book | first= Timo | last= Pennanen | year= 2006 | title=Sisältää hitin - levyt ja esittäjät Suomen musiikkilistoilla vuodesta 1972 | edition= 1st | publisher= Kustannusosakeyhtiö Otava | location= Helsinki| isbn=  978-951-1-21053-5 | page= 263 | language= fi }}</ref> and Japan where it reached number thirty-seven.<ref>{{cite web |title=ベイ・シティ・ローラーズのプロフィール |url=https://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/149748/ |website=ORICON NEWS |access-date=5 July 2025 |language=ja}}</ref> By early 1975, they were one of the biggest-selling acts in the United Kingdom. The successful 1975 UK tour prompted newspaper headlines about the rise of "Rollermania"<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> (alluding to [[Beatlemania]] a decade before). The band were the subject of a 20-week UK television series, ''[[Shang-a-Lang (TV series)|Shang-a-Lang]]'', which aired between April and December 1975.

A cover of [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]]' "[[Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby Goodbye)|Bye, Bye, Baby]]" stayed at No.&nbsp;1 in the UK for six weeks in March and April 1975, selling nearly a million copies and becoming the biggest seller of the year. The subsequent single, "[[Give a Little Love (Bay City Rollers song)|Give a Little Love]]" topped the chart in July 1975, achieving their second No.&nbsp;1 hit.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/><ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Two albums were produced during this period: ''[[Once Upon a Star]]'' and ''[[Wouldn't You Like It?]]'' (both 1975). Faulkner and Wood undertook the majority of the songwriting duties. By this time, Bay City Rollers fans had a completely distinctive style of dress, featuring calf-length [[tartan]] trousers and tartan [[scarf|scarves]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

English singer-songwriter [[Nick Lowe]] wrote a "jaundiced" (in Lowe's words)<ref name=canada_interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=9342a121-86f6-4403-8943-223081679e68 |title=Q and A with Nick Lowe |website=Canada.com |date=6 October 2007 |access-date=24 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501050558/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=9342a121-86f6-4403-8943-223081679e68 |archive-date=1 May 2014}}</ref> paean to the band titled "Bay City Rollers We Love You". The track was "carefully sculpted" to be poor enough to get Lowe out of a recording contract with United Artists. The strategy backfired. UA issued the record as by the Tartan Horde,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nicklowedisc.tripod.com/stiff/stiff.html |title=NICK LOWE DISCOGRAPHY – PART 1 |website=Nicklowedisc.tripod.com |access-date=24 April 2014}}</ref> which was the name given to Rollers fans in England, and it became a substantial hit in Japan.<ref name=canada_interview /> Lowe was obliged to record a follow-up song called "Rollers Show", which did not meet with the same commercial success. This follow-up song was included on the U.S. release of Lowe's first album ''[[Jesus of Cool|Pure Pop for Now People]]''.

===World impact: 1976===
[[File:Bay City Rollers 1978.jpg|thumb|right|Bay City Rollers performing in [[Helsinki]], Finland, in 1978]]

With increasing popularity in the United Kingdom and in a number of international markets, a concerted effort was made by [[Arista Records]] (the record company that evolved from Bell) to launch the band in North America. The new head of Arista Records, [[Clive Davis]], was instrumental in grooming and overseeing the project. After efforts from both the record label and Davis, the band achieved commercial breakthrough in the United States, as in late 1975 the Bay City Rollers reached No.&nbsp;1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with "[[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|Saturday Night]]".

During this period, the band had established a large following in Australia, and on 23 October 1976, they appeared on the long-running Australian music TV show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', a date which happened to coincide with a [[Solar eclipse of October 23, 1976|total eclipse]] of the sun. The show's director [[Ted Emery]] recalled:<ref>Wilmoth, Peter – ''Glad All Over – The Countdown Years 1974–1987'' McPhee Gribble/[[Penguin Books]], 1993. p. 149</ref>

{{blockquote|(there)... were thousands of kids done up in tartan pants that didn't reach the top of their shoes, constantly bashing on the [[plexiglas]] doors. They would do anything...to get into that television studio. There's 200 kids bashing on the door and a total eclipse of the sun occurred. I'd never seen one. On this day we all stopped in the studio and the Rollers went up on the roof. We stood out there and watched the flowers close up and all the automatic street lighting come on. It was chilling, the most fantastic thing you'd ever see. Downstairs the kids never turned around, staring into the plexiglas waiting to see the Rollers come out of the studio, go down the corridor and into the canteen. (They) never noticed the total eclipse of the sun.}}

Alan Longmuir had left the group by early 1976, due to both the pressures of the band's success and feeling discomfort at being a member of a teen band whilst in his late twenties.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> He was replaced for seven months by 17-year-old Ian Mitchell from Northern Ireland; he was the first band member born outside Edinburgh.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> With Mitchell, the group released their sixth studio album overall, ''[[Dedication (Bay City Rollers album)|Dedication]]'' (1976), and achieved commercial success with their cover version of the [[Dusty Springfield]] song "[[I Only Want to Be with You#Bay City Rollers version|I Only Want to Be with You]]". The song reached US No.&nbsp;12, as well as "Yesterday's Hero" (featuring live material from a 1976 personal appearance in Toronto's [[Nathan Phillips Square]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=des89c-lkRI |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202022510/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=des89c-lkRI |archive-date=2017-02-02 |url-status=dead |title=Youtube.com |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=15 June 2009 |access-date=16 July 2011}}</ref> and "Dedication".

===Decline and line–up changes: 1977–1979===

As the popularity of the Bay City Rollers waned, the shuffling of personnel continued which saw Mitchell leaving the band, being replaced by guitarist [[Pat McGlynn]]. Further struggles involved the direction of their sound, as the members wished to pursue more sophisticated styles. They settled on [[David Bowie]]'s producer, [[Harry Maslin]], and in August 1977 released ''[[It's a Game (Bay City Rollers album)|It's a Game]]'' as a four-piece group, comprising McKeown, Wood, Faulkner and Derek Longmuir. "[[You Made Me Believe in Magic]]" was released as the lead single from the album in the United States only, whilst elsewhere, "It's a Game" was released as the lead single, becoming their final UK Top 20 single when it reached number sixteen on the national singles charts in the United Kingdom in May 1977. Despite the decline in commercial success in markets they previously dominated, "It's a Game" provided them with their highest-charting German entry on the singles charts, reaching No.&nbsp;4 in the same year.<ref>''Starke Zeiten'', Hit-Bilanz, 1988 BMG-Ariola 258850</ref>

Released in the United States in May 1977, it reached number ten on the US [[Billboard Hot 100]] in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine that August, becoming the Bay City Rollers' third US Top 10 single. The follow up single, "[[The Way I Feel Tonight]]", reached number twenty-four in the United States and would mark the last appearance from the band on the US Billboard Hot 100.<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref> The ''It's a Game'' tour was recorded in 1977 at Japan's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan Hall]], and was later released in 2001 as ''Rollerworld: Live at the Budokan 1977''. The Bay City Rollers were on ''[[The Krofft Superstar Hour]]'', later named the ''Bay City Rollers Show'', an hour-long TV show that aired from 9 September 1978 to 27 January 1979. 

In 1978, the classic line-up of the Bay City Rollers released ''[[Strangers in the Wind]]'' which would become their final album together. Earlier that year, bassist [[Alan Longmuir]], a founding member, re-joined the band after a two-year hiatus, now performing rhythm guitar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sullivan |first1=Caroline |title=Alan Longmuir obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/03/alan-longmuir-obituary |website=The Guardian |access-date=5 July 2025 |date=3 July 2018}}</ref> The group timed the release of their new album to coincide with their own network television series, ''[[The Krofft Superstar Hour|The Krofft Superstar Hour Starring the Bay City Rollers]]'' on [[NBC]].

===The Rollers: 1979–1990===
[[File:Bay City Rollers with manager Tam Paton.jpeg|thumb|right|The band together with their manager, [[Tam Paton]] in 1976, who was later fired by the band in 1978]] 
At the end of 1978, the band had split with McKeown, and then fired their manager [[Tam Paton]] shortly afterward. Following this, they decided to continue in a more [[New wave music|new wave]], rock-oriented sound and changed their name to The Rollers. South African-born [[Duncan Faure]] joined the band as new lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter. With Faure, the line-up released three albums – ''[[Elevator (The Rollers album)|Elevator]]'' (1979), ''[[Voxx (album)|Voxx]]'' (1980) and ''[[Ricochet (Bay City Rollers album)|Ricochet]]'' (1981).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Following the expiry of the band's Arista contract, none of the releases sold as well as expected, and they stopped touring by late 1981. ''The A.V. Club'' compared ''Ricochet'' to the pop/new wave style of [[The Cars]] and recommended the album be "rescued from obscurity".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/read-this-this-bay-city-rollers-lp-should-be-rescued-f-1798250379|title=Read This: This Bay City Rollers LP should be rescued from obscurity|first=Joe|last=Blevins|website=News.avcluv.com|date=8 August 2016 |access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref>

During the 1980s and 1990s, The Rollers completed a number of short tours. Seven past members played Japan in 1982, and again in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |title=BCR |url=https://lesmckeown.com/bcr |website=lesmckeown.com |access-date=5 July 2025}}</ref> A reunion album, ''Breakout'', was released in Japan and Australia in 1985, and added drummer George Spencer.<ref name="Bigger Than a Bread Bin, Better than the Beatles.

The band toured extensively throughout the US and Canada as well as tours of the UK and Australia. This group also released an independent four-song EP titled ''Party Harty''.<ref name="Bigger Than a Bread Bin, Better than the Beatles.  The Story of the Bay City Rollers"/>

In 1990, Wood and Alan Longmuir joined with Faulkner to tour under the Bay City Rollers name and issued several CDs of re-recordings of the old Roller tunes.

===Reunion and spin–off: 1996–2000===

In 1996, the classic line-up reunited and performed "Saturday Night" on a Japanese television show to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Rollermania.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5N_g6qckk8 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/a5N_g6qckk8| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|title=Bay city rollers in Japan 1998|date=31 August 2009 |access-date=14 August 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1LSUu1XrJ4 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/i1LSUu1XrJ4| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|title=Bay City Rollers (in Japan 1996) - SATURDAY Night -|date=10 February 2013 |access-date=14 August 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The classic line-up (minus Derek Longmuir)<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/24/3|title = Former Bay City Roller escapes jail on child porn charges|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|last = Longmuir|first = Derek}}</ref> performed a one-off New Year's Eve millennium concert, the last official Bay City Rollers concert (1999–2000) in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle in Scotland. Interest was rekindled in the UK by various television documentaries about the group; and the television-advertised compilation ''Very Best of the Bay City Rollers'' entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] on release in 2004 at No.&nbsp;11.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

During the late 2000s, Ian Mitchell led his own Bay City Rollers band, which included lead vocalist [[Kyle Vincent]].  Mitchell was the only ex-Roller involved.

====Lawsuit to reclaim royalties from Arista====

In March 2007, six former members of the group (Faure plus the "classic line-up") announced a lawsuit against [[Arista Records]] in hopes of claiming what they described as "tens of millions of dollars" of unpaid royalties. Gordon "Nobby" Clark threatened to sue the other band members if their lawsuit was successful, stating that he was the creative force behind the band's success, even though he left the group in 1973, before the bulk of their fame and fortune began.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328133604/http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1019&id=437372007|url-status=dead|title=Scottish News – The Scotsman|archive-date=28 March 2007|website=Scotsman.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517033253/http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1019&id=449172007|url-status=dead|title=Scottish News – The Scotsman|archive-date=17 May 2007|website=Scotsman.com}}</ref> 

In September 2010, Clark, Ian Mitchell and Pat McGlynn filed a complaint in the courts in the United States against the six members (Faure plus the "classic line-up") over being excluded from the case against Arista records. Clark, Mitchell and McGlynn were seeking to have their rights determined and were seeking financial damages against the other Bay City Rollers for alleged breach of contract. In 2013, a judge in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the three due to the statute of frauds, which establishes that certain agreements must be in writing under certain conditions, and the appellate judge's ruling stated: "A claim for unjust enrichment must be based on the value of plaintiffs' contribution to the joint effort of the band at the time it made the relevant records, not on the income stream resulting from a revival over thirty years later."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/three-members-bay-city-rollers-617514 | title=Three Ex-Members of Bay City Rollers Denied in Royalty Collection Attempt | website=Hollywoodreporter.com | date=29 August 2013 | access-date=17 September 2013 | author=Gardner, Eriq}}</ref>
[[File:Cmglee Cambridge Bay City Rollers curtain call.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Bay City Rollers performing at the Cambridge Big Weekend Festival in July 2014]] 

In March 2011, a New York judge determined that the Bay City Rollers could move forward with their four-year-old lawsuit against Arista Records. Arista denied responsibility for the majority of the royalties, citing a New York statute of limitations. The statute limits plaintiffs from recovering damages post six years in contract disputes, which therefore would negate the Rollers' claims for royalties incurred before 2001. However, because Arista had continued to promise the Bay City Rollers their royalties in writing, the judge ruled that the statute was not applicable.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mickie |url=https://mickieszoo.blogspot.com/2011/06/bay-city-rollers-to-continue-suit.html |title=Mickie's Zoo: Bay City Rollers to continue suit against Arista Records |website=Mickieszoo.blogspot.com |date=1 June 2011 |access-date=16 July 2011}}</ref> 

After almost a decade, the legal battle came to an end with an out-of-court settlement in 2016. Arista Records' parent company [[Sony Music]] is believed to have paid $3.5 million, with each band member receiving £70,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/bay-city-rollers-legal-battle-reaches-end-road-865600|title=Bay City Rollers legal battle reaches end of the road|website=Scotsman.com|date=15 October 2016 |language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>

==Artistry==
===Musical themes and sound===

During their early career and into their peak period, the Bay City Rollers were described as ''Top of the Pops'' as "youthful" and having a "clean-cut image", with their sound focusing primarily on "cheery, sing-along pop hits", something ''Top of the Pops'' later argued credited the band for becoming "among the most popular musical acts of their time".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brazier |first1=Callum |title=Bay City Rollers |url=https://totparchive.co.uk/artist.php?name=bay-city-rollers |website=Top of the Pops Archive |access-date=5 July 2025 |language=en}}</ref> Bill Martin, who was sought by Bell Records to assist in the bands development, had been looking for a Scottish pop group which were "different from anyone else", later praising the bands "strong belief" in themselves. Despite the feeling amongst the band, Martin described the situation at the time as being "the reality was they could hardly tune their own guitars".<ref name="Bay City Rollers: The boy band that turned the world tartan"/> 

As a result, [[session musicians]] were used to lay down the musical arrangements for the band during recording sessions, as Martin feared that it would "take too long" to get the correct sound from the band due to their lack of experience and skill in playing instruments.<ref name="Bay City Rollers: The boy band that turned the world tartan"/> Following the release of their debut album, the band sought ways to become more involved in the production and songwriting for their next album, however this was denied by their producer Phil Coulter.<ref name="Bay City Rollers: The boy band that turned the world tartan"/> The refusal to allow the band to be more involved in the process lead to the band seeking a new producer to replace Coulter.<ref name="Bay City Rollers: The boy band that turned the world tartan"/>

During their transition period from the Bay City Rollers to simply The Rollers during the late 1970s, Wayne Coy argues that the sound they established for their ''[[Elevator (The Rollers album)|Elevator]]'' (1979) album segmented the band as "brilliantly demonstrating that they were not bubble headed pop pretenders" and described the album as "a marvellous power pop triumph".<ref name="Bay City Babylon: the unbelievable, but true story of the Bay City Rollers"/> Lyrically and musically, the band were considered by Coy to "resemble fun and good times".<ref name="Bay City Babylon: the unbelievable, but true story of the Bay City Rollers"/> Considered to be one of the most prominent acts within [[Music of Scotland|Scottish music]], their 1974 single "[[Shang-a-Lang (song)|Shang-a-Lang]]" has been described as a "true Scottish anthem", and a song that has since "segmented the Scottish music sound", being described as a composition that has a "brilliant Scottishness to it".<ref name="Shang-A-Lang re-released with music video featuring Scotland-supporting stars">{{cite web |title=Shang-A-Lang re-released with music video featuring Scotland-supporting stars |url=https://news.stv.tv/entertainment/bay-city-rollers-re-release-shang-a-lang-on-50th-anniversary-with-music-video-featuring-famous-scottish-faces |website=STV News |access-date=7 July 2025 |date=8 June 2024}}</ref>

By their most commercially successful period throughout the 1970s, the Bay City Rollers became widely known internationally for wearing [[tartan]] on stage, music videos and during promotional appearances, and were said to "create scenes of hysteria wherever they went".<ref>{{cite web |title=Bay City Rollers: Superfans tell story of Scotland's biggest boyband |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy87zr1dyllo |website=BBC News |access-date=5 July 2025 |date=26 November 2024}}</ref> Tartan attire would later become assigned as the bands "signature look".<ref>{{cite web |title=Bay City Rollers - Record Collector Magazine |url=https://recordcollectormag.com/articles/bay-city-rollers |website=Record Collector Magazine |access-date=5 July 2025 |language=en}}</ref> The arrival of Les McKeown to the band coincided with an overhaul of the group's image introducing [[Capri pants|half-mast trouser]]s, [[Platform shoes#1960s and 1970s|platform shoe]]s and [[tartan]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/scotsman-obituaries-les-mckeown-lead-singer-with-the-bay-city-rollers-3212379 |title=Scotsman Obituaries: Les McKeown, lead singer with the Bay City Rollers |newspaper=The Scotsman|date=23 April 2021 }}</ref>
