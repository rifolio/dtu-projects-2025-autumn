==History==

===Formation and early years (1994-1999)===
[[File:Jaret reddick at wireless.jpg|thumb|224x224px|Jaret Reddick, vocalist for Bowling for Soup in 2010|right]]Bowling for Soup has its origins in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]], where Jaret Reddick and other members of the band grew up. Reddick and original drummer Lance Morrill met in the fall of 1976. Reddick began playing music in 1985, at 13 years old. Reddick and guitarist Chris Burney knew each other in high school (they met in 1986) and as students in the 1980s, they grew up on the commercially successful heavy metal music of bands such as [[Quiet Riot]], [[Ratt|RATT]], and [[Mötley Crüe]], but were also influenced by the faster punk rock of the [[Ramones]] and later [[Green Day]]. Burney's family owned a Wichita Falls coffeehouse called "The Refuge" {{Citation needed|date=June 2025}} with a music stage and he played there with his first band, the Persecuted, where he and Reddick met bassist Erik Chandler and drummer Gary Wiseman in the early 1990s<ref name=AmSong>[https://americansongwriter.com/behind-the-band-name-bowling-for-soup/ Behind the Band Name: Bowling for Soup] American Songwriter.

Burney and Chandler soon formed the Folkadots, while Wiseman formed Gary & the Wiseman. Burney and Chandler, along with Morrill, also formed the band Slaw. Around this time, Reddick formed the band Terminal Seasons. Not too long after, Reddick and Morrill formed coolfork! which Burney later joined.{{cn|date=May 2025}} The band was in full swing by 1993, playing such venues as the Refuge.<ref name=AmSong/> A few months later, after forming a band called Rubberneck, the group changed their name to Bowling for Soup,<ref name=DentCo/> which was derived from the phrase "bowling for shit" from a comedy act by [[Steve Martin]],<ref>[http://www.bowlingforsoup.com/bio.html Bowling for Soup Biographies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222022118/http://www.bowlingforsoup.com/bio.html|date=December 22, 2008}}</ref> and the band was officially formed in Wichita Falls on June 4, 1994, by Reddick (lead vocals, guitar), Burney (guitar, backing vocals), Chandler (bass, backing vocals, acoustic guitar), and Morrill (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Morrill left the band on good terms and was replaced in July 1998 by Wiseman.<ref name=DentCo/>

In 1996, Bowling for Soup relocated to [[Denton, Texas]], and released a split album, [[Cell Mates (album)|Cell Mates]], with Denton band The V.I.M.S that same year, and in 1998 released their second studio album (and third overall), ''[[Rock on Honorable Ones!!]]'' for the Denton music label FFROE.<ref name=DentCo/> The group released its first EP, ''[[Tell Me When to Whoa]]'', through FFROE later that year. The album sold over 10,000 copies, prompting [[Jive Records]] to sign the band.{{cn|date=May 2025}} As a side project, beginning around 1999 until May 2018, Reddick and Chandler performed acoustic shows at smaller venues and showcases, playing primarily Bowling for Soup songs in an acoustic fashion, billed as Jaret & Erik.<ref>[https://www.rocksins.com/2011/04/bowling-for-soup-live-review-an-acoustic-evening-with-jaret-erik-at-the-junction-cambridge-9473/ Bowling For Soup Live Review – An Acoustic Evening With Jaret & Erik At The Junction, Cambridge] Rock Sins.

===''Let's Do It For Johnny!'' and ''Drunk Enough To Dance'' (2000-2003)===
''[[Let's Do It for Johnny!|Let's Do It for Johnny!!]]'', Bowling for Soup's major label debut, was released on [[Jive Records|Jive]] in 2000. The album mostly contained re-recordings of the group's previous material along with a few new tracks and a cover of [[Bryan Adams]]' song "[[Summer of '69]]".<ref>[http://www.virginradio.co.uk/music/artists/bowling_for_soup/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013202928/http://www.virginradio.co.uk/music/artists/bowling_for_soup/|date=October 13, 2007}}</ref> ''[[Drunk Enough to Dance]]'' is Bowling for Soup's second album with Jive Records, released August 6, 2002. It was recorded at Tree Sound Studios and Sonica Recording in Atlanta and Big Time Audio in [[Dallas]]. One of the album's two singles, "Girl All The Bad Guys Want" (the other single was "[[Emily (Bowling for Soup song)|Emily]]"), was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 in the "Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal" category. Reddick considers the Grammies one of his shining moments, not for the nomination, but for winning "worst dressed" from [[Joan Rivers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtv.com/news/1470874/bowling-for-soup-say-losing-a-grammy-has-its-perks/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216195510/http://www.mtv.com/news/1470874/bowling-for-soup-say-losing-a-grammy-has-its-perks/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 16, 2015|title=Bowling for Soup Say Losing a Grammy Has Its Perks|website=[[MTV]]}}</ref>

A re-release in 2003 added "Punk Rock 101", a cover of the 1980s [[new wave music|new wave band]] [[A Flock of Seagulls]]' "I Ran (So Far Away)", and "Star Song". An acoustic version of the song "Belgium" exists at the end of the album, as well as at the very end of the initial release. The cover of "I Ran (So Far Away)" was used as the opening theme song of the [[anime]] television show ''[[Saint Seiya|Saint Seiya: Knights of the Zodiac]]'' in North America.

The band appeared in the 2002 film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'', playing at a graduation party.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275022/trivia |title=Crossroads (2002) – Trivia – IMDb |website=[[IMDb]] |access-date=April 26, 2011}}</ref>

[[Image:Bowling for Soup Manchester2004.jpg|thumb|Bowling for Soup performs in [[Manchester]], England]]
''[[A Hangover You Don't Deserve]]'' was released on September 14, 2004, and has become the band's only [[Top 40]] album. Sales of the album were driven in large part by the [[radio]] [[airplay (song)|airplay]] of the single "[[1985 (SR-71 song)|1985]]", a song written by [[Mitch Allan]] of [[SR-71 (band)|SR-71]] and covered by Bowling For Soup with his permission.  Bowling for Soup did make some modifications to the lyrics to better fit their style with [[Mitch Allan]], lead vocalist of SR-71, contributed backing vocals to the song and appeared in the music video. "1985" became Bowling for Soup's biggest hit in the U.S., reaching No.&nbsp;23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. A second single from ''A Hangover You Don't Deserve'', "[[Almost (Bowling for Soup song)|Almost]]", charted on the [[UK Singles Chart]], No.&nbsp;46 on the U.S. Top 100, and No.&nbsp;23 on U.S. Pop 100. "[[Ohio (Come Back to Texas)|Ohio]]", better known as "Come Back to Texas", was released as a radio single in the U.S., but was not as popular as "1985" or "Almost", reaching only No.&nbsp;59 on the U.S. Pop 100.

''[[Bowling for Soup Goes to the Movies]]'', a compilation album of cover songs and contributions to movie soundtracks, was released by the band in 2005. Later that year, Reddick and Burney made several appearances on [[VH1]]'s ''[[I Love the '90s: Part Deux]]''. Bowling for Soup appeared briefly at the start of the 2005 film ''[[Cursed (2005 film)|Cursed]]'', playing the song "[[Li'l Red Riding Hood]]". The group's cover version of [[Modern English (band)|Modern English]]'s "[[I Melt With You]]" was used in the [[Disney]] movie ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]'' and was on [[Sky High Soundtrack|the movie's soundtrack album]]. A music video of the song was made, which aired on the [[Disney Channel]] and is included on the movie's DVD.<ref>[https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/disney-sky-high-sequel-super-college-save-university The sequel to Disney's Sky High would have graduated to a super-college, Save University] [[Syfy]].

The group went on the ''[[KDGE#Star_102.1|Star 102.1]] StarJam'' tour with [[Simple Plan]] in 2006 and were the opening act. They joined again the following year with Quietdrive and Army of Freshmen.

Bowling for Soup spent most of 2006 readying ''[[The Great Burrito Extortion Case]]'', the group's seventh album, which was released on November 7, 2006. The group released the first single from that album, "High School Never Ends", to [[iTunes]] on September 19, 2006. The song did sell well at first, and Jive Records pulled promotion for it, releasing "When We Die" as a single. Online demand grew steadily for "High School Never Ends", prompting Reddick to express regret for not standing up for its initial release. He said the song has "a poetic quality... that everyone can relate to."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/6-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-bowling-for-soups-jaret-reddick|title=6 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Bowling For Soup's Jaret Reddick|website=Kerrang!}}</ref> The UK release of the album was on February 5, 2007.

In 2006, the band embarked on The Get Happy Tour, which was set up as a joint venture with alongside [[Army of Freshmen]].  The original tour was planned with Bowling for Soup headlining, Army of Freshmen opening and two other bands ([[Punchline (band)|Punchline]] and [[Lucky Boys Confusion]]) playing between.  The tour kicked off in Austin, Texas on June 23, 2006, with the Vanished taking Lucky Boys Confusion's spot for the first three dates.  The band toured the U.S. over the summer and autumn of 2006 with the Get Happy Tour and ended on August 27, 2006, in Amarillo, Tex. This was followed by a UK tour in early February 2007. Coinciding with this UK tour was the UK release of "High School Never Ends". The tour included Bowling for Soup as main headliners, [[Wheatus]], [[Son of Dork]] and Army of Freshmen on the 12 date trek, which concluded at [[Hammersmith Palais]] in London, on the February 18.

The band released "I'm Gay" as the second UK single in early 2007. The release was on CD and 7" vinyl. A music video for the single was released in the UK, made up of live performances of the song from the "Get Happy Tour", of which the band had performed in the UK during February 2007. On September 25, 2007, it was announced on the official Bowling for Soup forums that "When We Die" would be released as a download only single in the UK on October 22, 2007, as the third single. Following this, the music video was added to the Kerrang television playlist and was played on Scuzz TV.
The group created an album (also on the label Jive) called ''On Your Mark... Get Set... Smoke a Cigarette'' which consisted of three songs: "Bipolar", "Somebody Get My Mom", "Li'l Red Riding Hood".

Bowling for Soup confirmed during the Get Happy Tour that the group would be performing another tour of the UK in October 2007, called the Get Happy Tour 2, gracing the U.S. over the summer and featuring support acts [[Melee (band)|Melee]], [[Quietdrive]], and Army of Freshmen. The UK tour bands were confirmed at the [[Download Festival]] (Army of Freshmen who played in the morning announced it first, and Bowling for Soup announced it later that afternoon), along with the lineup in ''[[Kerrang!]]'' on an advertisement poster for the new tour. The lineup consisted of Bowling for Soup, [[Bloodhound Gang]], [[Zebrahead]] and Army of Freshmen.

Bowling for Soup cowrote and sang the theme song for Disney's ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', "Today Is Gonna Be A Great Day". The group briefly appears in one episode of ''Phineas and Ferb'', called "[[Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo]]". "Greatest Day" was the opening song to the Nickelodeon film ''[[The Last Day of Summer (2007 film)|The Last Day of Summer]]''.

The band's first live DVD, ''Bowling for Soup: Live and Very Attractive'' was filmed over the course of the UK Get Happy Tour October 2007 and premiered at the AFI Dallas International Film Festival with the DVD released in the summer.

In September 2024, the band covered "[[Friend Like Me]]" for Disney's ''[[A Whole New Sound]]'', a compilation album featuring [[pop-punk]] covers of songs from classic Disney films.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuxZUwq9LFA |title=New Found Glory - Part of Your World (From "A Whole New Sound") |date=2024-08-15 |last=DisneyMusicVEVO |access-date=2024-08-21 |via=YouTube}}</ref>

On January 22, 2025, it was announced that Burney would not be rejoining Bowling for Soup as he decided to officially retire due to medical developments, touring nonstop and "30 years of rocking balls". The band elaborated they would not be replacing him and would continue as a three-piece, stating "you cannot replace a legend".<ref>{{cite web|first=Tyler|last=Jenke|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/bowling-for-soup-guitarist-chris-burney-retires-1235882521/|title=Founding Bowling for Soup Guitarist Chris Burney Retires: 'You Can't Replace a Legend!'|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=January 23, 2025|access-date=January 28, 2025}}</ref> Two days later, on January 24, the band announced their biggest headline show at [[Wembley Arena]], which is set to take place on December 13, 2025.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=James|last=Wilson-Taylor|url=https://rocksound.tv/news/bowling-for-soup-announce-wembley-arena-show|title=Bowling For Soup Announce Wembley Arena Show|magazine=[[Rock Sound]]|date=January 24, 2025|access-date=January 28, 2025}}</ref>

Bowling for Soup's hit song "1985" was originally written by SR-71's Mitch Allan. According to Reddick, Allan showed the song to him and instructed him to take it as his own, as it seemed more of a Bowling for Soup song than an SR-71 song. Bowling for Soup worked closely with the alternative band [[Army of Freshmen]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.armyoffreshmen.com/press/aof_fact_sheet.pdf|title = Army of Freshmen Official Website|access-date = April 23, 2015|publisher = Armyoffreshmen.com|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923173734/http://www.armyoffreshmen.com/press/aof_fact_sheet.pdf|archive-date = September 23, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> In the video for "High School Never Ends" the boy clapping can be seen wearing an Army of Freshmen T-shirt, and Army of Freshmen themselves can be seen as part of the BFS Marching Band. Reddick does guest vocals on four tracks on Army of Freshmen's album ''Under the Radar''.

In 2003, fellow Texan punk rockers Junior opened for Bowling for Soup when the group played the club Trees in [[Deep Ellum]]. Reddick later co-wrote the song "She's So Amazing" for the band's album ''Are We Famous Yet?'', and lends vocals as well. The Irish pop rock singer [[Lesley Roy]] lend her vocals for Bowling for Soup's song "Much More Beautiful Person" from the album ''[[The Great Burrito Extortion Case]]''. Both Roy and Bowling for Soup were assigned to the same record label. Reddick is friends with [[MC Lars]], and has lent his vocals for MC Lars' single "[[Download This Song]]". MC Lars was a part of Reddick's label Crappy Records. In 2009, Bowling for Soup cameoed in the music video "Telephone Operator" by the Leftovers, who were also a part of Crappy Records.

In 2001, Bowling for Soup performed the theme song for the [[Nickelodeon (TV network)|Nickelodeon]] film ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]''. The group's version of the theme was based on the previously written television series theme song written by [[Brian Causey]] of ''[[Man Or Astro-man?]]''. Also in 2001, Reddick wrote the lyrics for "Greatest Day" for the film ''[[Max Keeble's Big Move]]'' while the band did the music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273799/soundtrack|title= Max Keeble's Big Move (2001) – Soundtracks|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=April 23, 2015}}</ref> Bowling for Soup also performed the theme "Today is Gonna Be a Great Day" for the [[Disney Channel]] cartoon ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', Reddick stars in the episode "[[Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together]]" where he is the lead vocalist of a fictional band called "Love Händel". The band itself also appeared in animated form in the episode "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" in which the band performed an alternate version of the show's theme with Phineas and Ferb for their futuristic nephews. On [[Cartoon Network]], Reddick and Chandler both played an acoustic show in 2006.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}} And in August 2008 Reddick and Chandler filmed an exclusive video for ''[[Total Guitar]]'' magazine in the UK called "How To Write A Song In 5 Minutes". In 2008,  Reddick teamed up with [[SEGA]] to work on the theme song for ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]'', titled "Endless Possibility".

[[New Zealand]] band [[48May]] ran into legal issues and decided to take the song "Leather and Tattoos" off of the group's debut album, due to the melody sounding very similar to "[[Punk Rock 101]]". The album was replaced with a "tour edition" of the CD with the questionable song missing.

In 2006, Bowling for Soup covered [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]'s "[[London Bridge (Fergie song)|London Bridge]]" for Pepsi Smash Cover Art on Yahoo! videos.

In 2008, Reddick co-arranged co-wrote and produced the singles "SUV" and "Girls + Summer = Fun!" with solo artist [[Christy Darlington]], and Erik Chandler and Gary Wiseman performed on the recordings as well. These songs were subsequently released digitally. This collaboration resulted from Bowling for Soup and Darlington having performed concerts together and knowing each other since the late 1990s in the Dallas music scene and mutual respect and appreciation for each other's music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://darlingtonmusic.bandcamp.com|title=Signup – Bandcamp|access-date=December 22, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102093628/http://darlingtonmusic.bandcamp.com/|archive-date=January 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2014, Bowling for Soup covered the [[Green Day]] song "[[St. Jimmy]]" for the album ''[[Kerrang!]] Does Green Day's American Idiot''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/18807/kerrang-green-days-american-idiot/|title=Kerrang!

===Greenmount (2017)===

Lead vocalist Reddick provided vocals on the Lakesick track "Greenmount" as the theme song for the stoner adventure comedy of the same name. ''Greenmount'' stars [[Shane Kippel]] (star of ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation]]'') alongside creator Joshua Prior (who also fronts Lakesick), and John Donahue. ''Greenmount'' was released in June 2019.

==Music videos==
It became a running gag in Bowling for Soup's music videos to feature previous songs of the band as an introduction for the video. This can be seen in "Girl All the Bad Guys Want", "Emily", and "High School Never Ends", which feature music from "The Bitch Song", "Girl All the Bad Guys Want", and "1985" respectively.
