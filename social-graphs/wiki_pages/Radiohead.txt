'''Radiohead''' are<!-- This article is written in British English, which commonly treats collective nouns as plural. Please do NOT change "ARE" to "IS". Thank you. --> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], [[Oxfordshire]], in 1985. The band members are [[Thom Yorke]] (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers [[Jonny Greenwood]] (guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and [[Colin Greenwood]] (bass); [[Ed O'Brien]] (guitar, backing vocals); and [[Philip Selway]] (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer [[Nigel Godrich]] and the cover artist [[Stanley Donwood]] since 1994. Radiohead's [[Experimental music|experimental]] approach is credited with advancing the sound of [[alternative rock]].

Radiohead signed to [[EMI]] in 1991 and released their debut album, ''[[Pablo Honey]]'', in 1993. Their debut single, "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]", was a worldwide hit, and their popularity and critical standing rose with ''[[The Bends (album)|The Bends]]'' in 1995. Their third album, ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the greatest albums in popular music, with complex production and themes of [[social alienation|modern alienation]]. Their fourth album, ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from [[electronic music]], [[jazz]], [[classical music]] and [[krautrock]]. Though ''Kid A'' divided listeners, it was later named the best album of the decade by multiple outlets. It was followed by ''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'' (2001), recorded in the same sessions. Radiohead's final album for EMI, ''[[Hail to the Thief]]'' (2003), blended rock and electronic music, with lyrics addressing the [[war on terror]].

Radiohead self-released their seventh album, ''[[In Rainbows]]'' (2007), as a [[music download|download]] for which customers could [[Pay what you want|set their own price]], to critical and commercial success. Their eighth album, ''[[The King of Limbs]]'' (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive [[Loop (music)|looping]] and [[Sampling (music)|sampling]]. ''[[A Moon Shaped Pool]]'' (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's [[orchestra]]l arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway and O'Brien have released solo albums. In 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, [[The Smile (band)|the Smile]].

By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.<ref>Jonathan, Emma.

"Creep" and "[[Nude (song)|Nude]]" (2008) reached the [[top 40]] on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named Radiohead one of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 greatest artists of all time]], and included five of their albums in its lists of the "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]".

''Pablo Honey'' was released in February 1993. It reached number 22 in the UK charts. "Creep" and its follow-up singles "Anyone Can Play Guitar" and "[[Stop Whispering]]" failed to become hits, and "[[Pop Is Dead]]", a non-album single, also sold poorly.

In early 1993, Radiohead began to attract listeners elsewhere.

Radiohead began work on their second album in 1994 with the veteran [[Abbey Road Studios]] producer [[John Leckie]].

The ''[[My Iron Lung]]'' EP and single, released in 1994, was Radiohead's reaction, marking a transition towards the greater depth they aimed for on their second album.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mallins |first=Steve |date=1 April 1995 |title=Scuba Do |journal=[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]}}</ref> It was Radiohead's first collaboration with their future producer, [[Nigel Godrich]], then working under Leckie as an [[audio engineer]],<ref name="McKinnon-2006">{{cite news |last=McKinnon |first=Matthew |date=24 July 2006 |title=Everything in its right place |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/everything-in-its-right-place-1.587693 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170935/http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/everything-in-its-right-place-1.587693 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |access-date=12 April 2016 |website=[[CBC Arts]]}}</ref> and the artist [[Stanley Donwood]].

Having introduced more new songs on tour, Radiohead finished recording their second album, ''[[The Bends (album)|The Bends]]'', by 1995, and released it that March. It was driven by dense riffs and ethereal atmospheres, with greater use of keyboards.<ref name="guitar-world" /> It received stronger reviews for its songwriting and performances.<ref name="FREQUENCY" /> While Radiohead were seen as outsiders to the [[Britpop]] scene that dominated music media at the time, they were finally successful in the UK,<ref name="KENT" /> as the singles "[[Fake Plastic Trees]]", "[[High and Dry]]", "[[Just (song)|Just]]", and "[[Street Spirit (Fade Out)]]" became chart successes. "High and Dry" became a modest hit, but Radiohead's growing fanbase was insufficient to repeat the worldwide success of "Creep". ''The Bends'' reached number 88 on the US album charts, and remains Radiohead's lowest showing there.<ref name="art-rock" /> Jonny Greenwood later said ''The Bends'' was turning point for Radiohead: "It started appearing in people's [best-of] polls for the end of the year.

[[Nigel Godrich]] first worked with Radiohead as an audio engineer on their second album, ''The Bends''. He has produced all their studio albums since their third album, ''OK Computer''.<ref name="McKinnon-2006" /> Godrich has been dubbed the band's "sixth member", an allusion to [[George Martin]] being called the "[[Fifth Beatle]]".<ref name="McKinnon-2006" /> In 2016, Godrich said: "I can only ever have one band like Radiohead who I've worked with for this many years. That's a very deep and profound relationship. The Beatles could only have ever had one George Martin; they couldn't have switched producers halfway through their career. All that work, trust, and knowledge of each other would have been thrown out of the window and they'd have to start again."<ref>{{cite web |last=Earle |first=Toby |date=6 July 2016 |title=Nigel Godrich interview: Radiohead and I have a profound relationship |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/music/nigel-godrich-interview-radiohead-and-i-have-a-very-deep-and-profound-relationship-a3283096.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726111030/https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/music/nigel-godrich-interview-radiohead-and-i-have-a-very-deep-and-profound-relationship-a3283096.html |archive-date=26 July 2018 |access-date=9 July 2016 |website=[[The Evening Standard]] |language=en-GB}}</ref>
