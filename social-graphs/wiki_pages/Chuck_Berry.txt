'''Charles Edward Anderson Berry''' (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) was an American singer, guitarist and songwriter who pioneered [[rock and roll]]. Nicknamed the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Father of Rock and Roll]]", he refined and developed [[rhythm and blues]] into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as "[[Maybellene]]" (1955), "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" (1956), "[[Rock and Roll Music (song)|Rock and Roll Music]]" (1957), and "[[Johnny B. Goode]]" (1958).<ref>{{cite news|first=Kalhan|last=Rosenblatt|date=March 18, 2017|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/chuck-berry-father-rock-n-roll-dies-90-missouri-police-n699311|title=Chuck Berry, father of rock 'n' roll, dies at 90|website=[[NBC News]]|access-date=April 27, 2019|archive-date=May 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522005252/https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/chuck-berry-father-rock-n-roll-dies-90-missouri-police-n699311 |url-status=live}}</ref> Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and [[consumerism]], and developing a music style that included guitar [[guitar solo|solo]]s and [[Guitar showmanship|showmanship]], Berry was a major influence on subsequent [[rock music]].<ref name=Campbell2008p168>Campbell, M. (ed.) (2008). ''Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes On''. 3rd ed. Cengage Learning. pp. 168–169.</ref>

Born into a middle-class black family in [[St. Louis]], Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at [[Sumner High School (St. Louis)|Sumner High School]]. While still a high school student, he was convicted of [[armed robbery]] and was sent to a [[reformatory]], where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar [[riff]]s and showmanship techniques of the [[blues]] musician [[T-Bone Walker]], Berry began performing with the [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson Trio]]. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met [[Muddy Waters]], who suggested he contact [[Leonard Chess]], of [[Chess Records]]. With Chess, he recorded "Maybellene"—Berry's adaptation of the country song "[[Ida Red (song)|Ida Red]]"—which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on ''Billboard'' magazine's rhythm and blues chart.

By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/home/5076088-155/chuck-berry-a-rock-n-roll|title=Chuck Berry, a rock 'n' roll originator, dies at age 90|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=March 18, 2017|access-date=March 27, 2017|archive-date=March 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327171654/http://www.sltrib.com/home/5076088-155/chuck-berry-a-rock-n-roll|url-status=live}}</ref> He was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the [[Mann Act]]—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines for the purpose of having sex. After his release in 1963, Berry had several more successful songs, including "[[No Particular Place to Go]]", "[[You Never Can Tell (song)|You Never Can Tell]]", and "[[Nadine (song)|Nadine]]". However, these did not achieve the same success or lasting impact of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgia performer, playing his past material with local backup bands of variable quality.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9078885#cite|title=Chuck Berry|encyclopedia=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|access-date=February 21, 2010|date=|archive-date=June 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604054111/http://library.eb.co.uk/?target=%2Feb%2Farticle-9078885#cite|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1972, he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of "[[My Ding-a-Ling]]" became his only record to top the charts.

In May 1955, Berry traveled to Chicago, where he met Muddy Waters who suggested he contact [[Leonard Chess]], of [[Chess Records]]. Berry thought his blues music would interest Chess, but Chess was a larger fan of Berry's take on "[[Ida Red (song)|Ida Red]]".<ref name=pc5>{{Pop Chronicles |5|5 |Leonard Chess}}.</ref> On May 21, 1955, Berry recorded an adaptation of the song "Ida Red", under the title "[[Maybellene]]", with [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson]] on the piano, [[Jerome Green]] (from [[Bo Diddley]]'s band) on the maracas, Ebby Hardy on the drums and [[Willie Dixon]] on the bass.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rothwell |first=Fred |title=Long Distance Information: Chuck Berry's Recorded Legacy |date=2001 |publisher=Music Mentor Books |isbn=978-0-9519888-2-4 |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hs4ZAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> "Maybellene" sold over a million copies, reaching number one on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' magazine's rhythm and blues chart and number five on its Best Sellers in Stores chart for September 10, 1955.<ref name="Chuck Berry"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.die-rock-and-roll-ag.de/html/chuck_1955-56.html|title=Chuck 1955–56|publisher=Die-rock-and-roll-ag.de|access-date=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002113531/http://www.die-rock-and-roll-ag.de/html/chuck_1955-56.html|archive-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> Berry said, "It came out at the right time when Afro-American music was spilling over into the mainstream pop."<ref>NBC Evening News, March 18, 2017</ref>

When Berry first saw a copy of the ''Maybellene'' record, he was surprised that two other individuals, including DJ [[Alan Freed]], had been given writing credit; that would entitle them to some of the royalties.

When Berry was released from prison in 1963, his return to recording and performing was made easier because [[British invasion]] bands—notably the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] and the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]]—had sustained interest in his music by releasing cover versions of his songs,<ref>{{harvtxt|Pegg|2003|p=163}}.</ref><ref name="Miles2009">{{cite book|last=Miles|first=Barry|title=The British Invasion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&pg=PA20|access-date=February 6, 2014|year=2009|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=9781402769764|page=20|archive-date=June 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627144252/http://books.google.com/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&pg=PA20|url-status=live}}</ref> and other bands had reworked some of them, such as [[the Beach Boys]]' 1963 hit "[[Surfin' U.S.A.

Berry returned to Chess from 1970 to 1973. There were no hit singles from the 1970 album ''Back Home'', but in 1972, Chess released a live recording of "[[My Ding-a-Ling]]", a novelty song that he had recorded in a different version as "My Tambourine" on his 1968 LP ''From St. Louie to Frisco''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Pegg|2003|p=184}}.</ref> The track became his only number-one single. A live recording of "[[Reelin' and Rockin']]", issued as a follow-up single in the same year, was his last Top 40 hit in both the US and the UK. Both singles were included on the part-live, part-studio album ''[[The London Chuck Berry Sessions]]'' (other albums of London sessions were recorded by Chess's mainstay artists [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]]). Berry's second tenure with Chess ended with the 1975 album ''Chuck Berry'', after which he did not make a studio record until ''[[Rockit (album)|Rockit]]'' for [[Atco Records]] in 1979, which would be his last studio album for 38 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Berry,_Chuck/Discography/album/P3664/R30491/|title=Rock It Album Review, Songs, Ratings|publisher=starpulse.com|access-date=June 2, 2010|archive-date=June 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606175211/http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Berry,_Chuck/Discography/album/P3664/R30491/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Berry toured on the strength of his earlier successes. He was on the road for many years, carrying only his [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] guitar, confident that he could hire a band that already knew his music no matter where he went.

(Springsteen related in the documentary film ''[[Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll]]'' that Berry did not give the band a set list and expected the musicians to follow his lead after each guitar intro. Berry did not speak to the band after the show. Nevertheless, Springsteen backed Berry again when he appeared at the concert for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995.)

Berry continued to play 70 to 100 one-nighters per year in the 1980s, still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop.

==Controversies==
In 1987, Berry was charged with assaulting a woman at [[Gramercy Park Hotel|New York's Gramercy Park Hotel]]. He was accused of causing "lacerations of the mouth, requiring five stitches, two loose teeth, [and] contusions of the face." He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of harassment and paid a $250 fine.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/chuck-berry-inside-father-of-rocks-triumphs-scandals-w475260|title=Chuck Berry: Farewell to the Father of Rock|last=Gilmore|first=Mikal|authorlink=Mikal Gilmore|date=April 7, 2017|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=May 15, 2018|archive-date=June 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620004542/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/chuck-berry-inside-father-of-rocks-triumphs-scandals-w475260|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1990, he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a [[video camera]] in the bathroom of his restaurant. Berry claimed that he had the camera installed to catch a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant. Although his guilt was never proven in court, Berry opted for a class action settlement. One of his biographers, Bruce Pegg, estimated that it cost Berry over $1.2 million plus legal fees.<ref name="SweetTunes" /> His lawyers said he had been the victim of a conspiracy to profit from his wealth.<ref name="SweetTunes" />

Reportedly, according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', a police raid on his house found intimate videotapes of women. Also found in the raid were 62 grams of [[marijuana]]. Felony drug charges were filed and Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was given a six-month suspended jail sentence, placed on two years unsupervised probation, and was ordered to donate $5,000 to a local hospital.<ref name="RSBIO">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chuckberry/biography |title=Chuck Berry: Biography |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=March 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714112146/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chuckberry/biography |archive-date=July 14, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A pioneer of rock and roll, Berry was a significant influence on the development of both the music and the attitude associated with the rock music lifestyle. With songs such as "[[Maybellene]]" (1955), "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" (1956), "[[Rock and Roll Music (song)|Rock and Roll Music]]" (1957) and "[[Johnny B. Goode]]" (1958), Berry refined and developed [[rhythm and blues]] into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics successfully aimed to appeal to the early teenage market by using graphic and humorous descriptions of teen dances, fast cars, high school life, and consumer culture,<ref name=Britannica/> and utilizing [[guitar solo]]s and [[Guitar showmanship|showmanship]] that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.<ref name=Campbell2008p168/>  Thus Berry, the songwriter, according to critic [[Jon Pareles]], invented rock as "a music of teenage wishes fulfilled and good times (even with cops in pursuit)."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/arts/chuck-berry-dead.html |title=Chuck Berry, Rock 'n' Roll Pioneer, Dies at 90 |first=John|last=Pareles |authorlink=Jon Pareles|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 18, 2017 |access-date=March 21, 2017 |archive-date=March 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320195947/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/arts/chuck-berry-dead.html |url-status=live }}</ref>  Berry contributed three things to rock music: an irresistible swagger, a focus on the guitar riff as the primary melodic element and an emphasis on songwriting as storytelling.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joe|last=Lynch |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chuck-berry-didnt-invent-rock-n-roll-but-he-turned-an-attitude-changed-world-987198 |title=Chuck Berry Didn't Invent Rock 'n' Roll, But He Turned It Into an Attitude That Changed the World |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 18, 2017 |access-date=March 19, 2017 |archive-date=August 23, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823205015/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chuck-berry-didnt-invent-rock-n-roll-but-he-turned-an-attitude-changed-world-987198 |url-status=live }}</ref> His records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical, showmanship and musical components of rock and roll.

According to Cleveland.com's Troy L. Smith, "Chuck Berry didn't invent rock and roll all by his lonesome. But he was the man who took rhythm and blues and transformed it into a new genre that would ever change popular music. Songs like 'Maybellene,' 'Johnny B. Goode,' 'Roll Over Beethoven' and 'Rock and Roll Music' would showcase the core elements of what rock and roll would become. The sound, the format and the style were built on the music Berry created. To some extent, everyone who followed was a copycat."<ref>{{cite web|first=Troy L.|last=Smith|url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2020/06/50-most-important-african-american-music-artists-of-all-time.html|title=50 most important African American music artists of all time|date=June 25, 2020|website=cleveland.com}}</ref>
