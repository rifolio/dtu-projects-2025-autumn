'''Garbage''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1993 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref name="behindthemusic">{{cite episode | title = Garbage | series = Behind The Music | series-link = Behind The Music | credits = Jim Forbes (narrator) | network = [[VH1]] | airdate = 31 March 2002}}</ref> The band's line-up, consisting of Scottish musician [[Shirley Manson]] (vocals) and American musicians [[Duke Erikson]] (guitar, bass, keyboards), [[Steve Marker]] (guitar, keyboards), and [[Butch Vig]] (drums, percussion), has remained unchanged since its inception. All four members are involved in songwriting and production.

The band's 1995 [[Garbage (album)|eponymous debut album]] was critically acclaimed, selling over four million copies and achieving [[music recording sales certification|double platinum]] certification in the UK, the US, and Australia.

==History==

===Formation (1993–1994) ===
[[File:SmartStudiosWisconsin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Smart Studios]] was established in 1983 by Vig and Marker, and was where Manson auditioned for the band]]

Duke Erikson and [[Butch Vig]] had been in several bands together, including [[Spooner (band)|Spooner]] and [[Fire Town]] (with Steve Marker as a [[sound engineer]]). In 1983, Vig and Marker founded [[Smart Studios]] in Madison and Vig's production work brought him to the attention of [[Sub Pop]]. Spooner reunited in 1990 and released another record, but disbanded in 1993 as Vig and Marker's career as producers took over.<ref name="RecordCollector">"Welcome to Spooner Town", by Andy Davis, ''[[Record Collector]]'', issue No.&nbsp;209, January 1997</ref> In 1994, as Vig had become "kind of burned out on doing really long records".<ref name="sos" /> He collaborated with Erikson and Marker by doing remixes for acts such as [[U2]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], and [[House of Pain]]. The remixes featured different instrumentation, and often highlighting new guitar hooks and bass grooves. This experience inspired the three men to form a band, where they "wanted to take that remix sensibility and somehow translate it into all of the possibilities of a band setup."<ref name=sos>{{cite web |url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/mar97/butchvig.html |title= BUTCH VIG: Nevermind The Garbage |work=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=March 1997 |author=Buskin, Richard |access-date= 2012-01-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926103557/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/mar97/butchvig.html |archive-date= September 26, 2012}}</ref>

According to Vig, the team drew inspiration for its name from a hostile early comment, when a friend of the band heard recording material said, "This shit sounds like garbage!"<ref name="behindthemusic" />  However, according to ''This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake'', an autobiography of the band, Vig wrote in his 1993 studio journal about the creative process; of working for long periods of time, "without coming up with anything cool... and when you least expect it, it all falls into place." The name derives from the last line of this entry: "I hope that all this garbage will become something beautiful!".<ref>{{Cite book |title=This is the noise that keeps me awake |author= Garbage (Musical group) |others=Cohen, Jason |isbn= 978-1617755507 |publisher=Akashic Books |location= Brooklyn, NY |oclc= 959035520|year = 2017}}</ref>

Initial sessions with Vig on vocals, along with the members' past work with all-male groups, led to the band's desire for a woman on lead.<ref name="volume">{{cite journal |last=Scanlon |first=Ann |date=1 November 1994 |title=Garbage Interview |url=http://www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml |journal=Volume |issue=12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991014042851/http://www.cafemomo.com/inprint/9411volume.shtml |archive-date=October 14, 1999 |access-date=24 February 2008}}</ref> Vig declared that they wanted to find a female vocalist like "[[Debbie Harry]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Chrissie Hynde]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]]—all really strong, unique personalities".<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Bosso|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/butch-vig-the-10-records-that-changed-my-life|title=Butch Vig: The 10 Records That Changed My Life|website=[[Louder (website)|Louder]]|date=8 October 2015 |access-date= 27 February 2018}}</ref> Marker and Vig desired someone "who didn't have a high, chirpy, girly quality to her voice" and who could sing in an understated way, in contrast to "these alterna-rock singers [that] have a tendency to [[Screaming (music)|scream]]".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-12-17-ca-15158-story.html|title= POP MUSIC : Beyond the Pail : How to turn Garbage into gold|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 17, 1995 |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |access-date= 2012-01-19}}</ref>  Marker was watching ''[[120 Minutes]]'' when he saw the music video for [[Angelfish (band)|Angelfish]]'s "Suffocate Me", and had been watching ''120 Minutes'' in order to seek a singer for the newly formed band by himself, Vig and Erikson.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Jason |title=This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake |date=2017 |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=978-1-61775-550-7 |page=12}}</ref> He showed the video to Erikson and Vig while their manager Shannon O'Shea tracked down the band's singer, Shirley Manson. When Manson was contacted, she did not know who Vig was and was urged to check the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]] on ''[[Nevermind]]'', the [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] album which Vig had produced.<ref name="behindthemusic" />

On April 8, 1994, Manson met Erikson, Marker, and Vig for the first time in London. Later that evening Vig was informed of Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s [[Death of Kurt Cobain|suicide]].<ref name="behindthemusic" /> Garbage was put on hold until Angelfish was finished touring North America in support of [[Live (band)|Live]].<ref name="TFYUS">"''Thanks For Your, Uhh Support'', [[Absolute Garbage|Absolute Garbage DVD]].

Angelfish disbanded at the end of the Live tour. Manson called O'Shea and asked to audition again, feeling that "it could work out".<ref name="behindthemusic" />

Manson described her first session with the band as "a disaster", as she had no experience as a [[session player]], and she and the band were "two parties totally uncomfortable with the situation", but the "mutual disdain" from that meeting managed to pull the band together. Manson was granted a second chance by the band who were instantly impressed by her "quiet vocals" on the song "Queer". As a result, Manson relocated to Madison, Wisconsin from [[Scotland]] to begin work on the band's debut album.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Jason |title=This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake |date=2017 |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=978-1-61775-550-7 |page=19}}</ref> The first songs were skeletal versions of the songs "[[Stupid Girl (Garbage song)|Stupid Girl]]", "[[Queer (song)|Queer]]" and "[[Vow (song)|Vow]]", which led to some ad-libbed lyrics by Manson.<ref name=Serendipitous>{{cite magazine |last= Borzillo |first=Carrie |title= Garbage's Serendipitous Success; Popularity Falls into Place for Almo Act |date=1996-03-23 |magazine= Billboard |location=Los Angeles |pages=9, 97 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iQ8EAAAAMBAJ&q=Garbage%20Only%20Happy%20When%20it%20Rains&pg=PA9}}</ref><ref name="makingmusic">"''Making Music'' June 1, 1996 issue".

Recollections of the meeting between both Manson and Merlis differs between the two, however, Merlis claims that he did not insinuate during the meeting that Vig would be needed to promoted in order for the band to sell records. Following the meeting, Geffen Records concluded that the band appeared to "want the press campaign to go", and that they wish to be perceived "as a band, and not as a Butch Vig side project".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Jason |title=This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake |date=2017 |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=978-1-61775-550-7 |page=49}}</ref> 

Following the release of ''Garbage'', Manson's personality during interviews was highly praised, with Merlis claiming that she treats an interview "like a performance", acknowledging that in reality the press was not interested in Vig, but rather were equally interested in Manson. Initially projected as "three producers and a girl", the band were critical of this statement given each of their musical history in their respective bands prior to forming Garbage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Jason |title=This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake |date=2017 |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=978-1-61775-550-7 |page=49}}</ref> Garbage had no plans to perform on stage, but once urged to play live during the recording of the music video for "Vow", they enjoyed the performance and decided to schedule a tour.<ref name=GSS-Billboard>{{cite magazine|last=Borzillo|first=Carrie|title=Garbage's Serendipitous Success|year=1996|magazine=Billboard|location=Los Angeles|pages=9, 97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQ8EAAAAMBAJ&q=Garbage%20shannon%20o'shea&pg=PA97}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.isthmus.com/archive/isthmus-35/march-8-1996-garbage-on-the-streets/|journal=[[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]]|title=Garbage on the streets|date=March 8, 1996|author=Laskin, Tom|access-date=October 18, 2015}}</ref> The [[Garbage tour]] started in November 1995, and continued throughout 1996, with the band making their first public performance in [[Minneapolis]] with Daniel Shulman recruited by the band to play bass guitar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Jason |title=This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake |date=2017 |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=978-1-61775-550-7 |page=54}}</ref> During the tour, Manson later recalled she "didn't feel like I belonged there" or that "anyone would take her seriously" which led her to feeling self conscious.

=== ''Version 2.0'' and continued popularity (1997–2000) ===

[[File:Shirleymansonversion2.0.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Lead singer Shirley Manson during the Version 2.0 era]]

Garbage relocated to [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] on March 1, 1997 to write songs for their second album. The band had "little hesitation" to begin work on a follow up album from their successful debut, with the bands chemistry said to have been "cemented" as a result of the intense touring schedule during 1995 and 1996 to promote ''Garbage''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Jason |title=This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake |date=2017 |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=978-1-61775-550-7 |page=77}}</ref> During these sessions, the band produced the beginnings for songs which would later become "[[Push It (Garbage song)|Push It]]", "[[I Think I'm Paranoid]]", "Hammering In My Head", "[[When I Grow Up (Garbage song)|When I Grow Up]]" and "Wicked Ways".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Jason |title=This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake |date=2017 |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=978-1-61775-550-7 |page=78}}</ref> Returning to Smart Studios a short while later, the band found themselves under intense pressure to repeat the success of ''Garbage''. The band decided not to change their formula, but progress musically by pushing their sound as far as it could go—hence the album's eventual title ''[[Version 2.0]]'', which was completed by February 15, 1998. In March, the first single "Push It" became the No.&nbsp;1 most added record at the UK Alternative Radio.<ref name="Fastfacts">{{cite web | url=http://garbage.com/ | title=Garbage Fast Facts | website=Garbage.com | access-date=2008-02-24 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20000408170127/http://garbage.com/ |archive-date = 2000-04-08}}</ref> It became their third consecutive UK top ten hit at No.&nbsp;9.<ref name="BGPromo" /><ref name="ussingles">{{cite magazine | url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=garbage|chart=all}} | title=Single Chart History: Garbage | magazine=Billboard.com | access-date=2008-02-24}}</ref>

Garbage rejected, with Erikson claiming that the "band were not ready", claiming that "the performance on ''Saturday Night Live'' would hurt more than giving no performance at all".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Jason |title=This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake |date=2017 |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=978-1-61775-550-7 |page=88}}</ref> Garbage began touring ''Version 2.0'' that month, a tour which lasted until the end of 1999. "[[I Think I'm Paranoid]]" was released worldwide in July, while the music video for "Push It" received eight nominations at the 1998 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429336/19980910/garbage.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030906175745/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429336/19980910/garbage.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 6, 2003| title=Garbage Grabs A Donut At VMAs Despite Eight Nominations|work=MTV News|access-date=2008-02-24}}</ref> By October 12, "[[Special (Garbage song)|Special]]" was released and Garbage was nominated for three [[MTV Europe Music Awards]]: "Best Group", "Best Rock Act" and "Best Video" for "Push It".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/184529.stm|title=Entertainment All Saints top MTV nominations|work=BBC News|date=1 October 1998|access-date=31 January 2015}}</ref> Given the success of ''Version 2.0'' and the band themselves, they recruited a "more experienced management team" on the advice of Jerry Moss and Paul Kremen from Almo Sounds and also renegotiated their contract terms with [[Mushroom Records]], whose general manager, Gary Ashley, who initially signed the band, had since left the record label. Their initial contract had a clause in which it was associated with a "key man", who in this case was Ashley, meaning that since he had left the record label, their contract could essentially be terminated. However, the owner of Mushroom Records, Michael Gudinski, deemed Garbage "too important" for the label, and successfully prevented [[Virgin Records]] from signing the band.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Jason |title=This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake |date=2017 |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=978-1-61775-550-7 |page=101}}</ref>

=== ''Beautiful Garbage'' (2001–2002) ===
[[File:Garbage Matters.ogg|thumb|right|[[Shirley Manson]] interview from 2001, around the release of ''[[Beautiful Garbage]]'']]

Garbage regrouped on April 10, 2001. The group began work on their third record, and put aside plans for a [[B-sides]] album due to the sale of Almo Sounds to the [[Universal Music Group|UMG]]. Manson ran an online blog throughout the recording of the album named ''[[Beautiful Garbage]]''. During the recording of the album, Garbage invoked a provision of its contract to leave Almo, and sued UMG when it refused to terminate the contract. UMG threatened to use Manson's 1993 solo contract to tie Garbage to the label.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/garbage-sue-universal-20010131 Garbage Sue Universal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029013728/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/garbage-sue-universal-20010131 |date=October 29, 2017}}, ''Rolling Stone''</ref> The suit was settled on July 29, 2001, and Garbage moved to [[Interscope]]. Lead single "Androgyny" was released to radio by the end of August, and its video was released on September 10.<ref name="BGInterscopePOSbrochure">{{cite book |title=Beautifulgarbage |version=point-of-sale brochure |publisher=[[Interscope Records]] |id=Accessed 2008-02-24}}</ref> The following day, due to the [[September 11 attacks]] in [[New York City]] and [[Washington D.C.]], the promotion schedule for the album was put on hold.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=January 2002 |title=Garbage interview |magazine=[[Kerrang!]]}}</ref>

Released three weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]], the album suffered from lack of promotion, mixed reaction from critics and fans alike, and the failure of its [[lead single]] "[[Androgyny (song)|Androgyny]]" to achieve high chart positions.<ref>"''Thanks For The, Uhhh, Support'' Documentary" (Retrieved - 2007-12-11)</ref> "Androgyny" was later described as "the wrong song for the moment", largely in part due to its "upbeat nature" and radio stations "not knowing what to do" with such an upbeat song. During recording an episode of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', Korda Marshall from Mushroom Records claimed that "we cannot get "Androgyny" played on any radio station" and advised the band that they had no alternative available. Manson recalled that the band "had never had a problem getting airplay in the United Kingdom before" and given the success of ''Version 2.0'' had "no reason to believe that we would meet such sudden resistance".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Jason |title=This Is The Noise That Keeps Me Awake |date=2017 |publisher=Akashic Books |isbn=978-1-61775-550-7 |page=123}}</ref> Despite faltering in major markets, ''Beautiful Garbage'' debuted at number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} [[Top Electronic Albums]] chart where it stayed for eight weeks,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-g/garbage_main.htm |title=Garbage (Timeline) |website= RockOnTheNet.com |access-date= 2007-12-11}}</ref> topped the album charts in Australia, and was named one of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s "Top 10 Albums of the Year".<ref name=autogenerated6>"''Breaking Up the Girl'' Hits magazine trade ad" (Retrieved - 2007-12-11)</ref>

In May 2023, longtime touring and recording bass guitarist [[Eric Avery]] left the band to rejoin [[Jane's Addiction]]. Regarding his departure, Manson posted: "We are all genuinely happy for Eric as this course of action, this band of his, is where his heart lies and always has.
