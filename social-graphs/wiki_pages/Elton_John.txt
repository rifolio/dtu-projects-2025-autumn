== Early life and education ==
Reginald Kenneth Dwight was born on 25 March 1947 in [[Pinner]], [[Middlesex]] (now part of the [[London Borough of Harrow]]), the eldest child of Stanley Dwight (1925–1991) and only child of Sheila Eileen (née Harris; 1925–2017), who had married in 1945.<ref name="Telegraph-detective">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435132/Family-detective-Elton-John.html |title=Family detective: Elton John |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 November 2006<!-- archives disagree with current page --> |access-date=22 July 2025 |last=Barratt |first=Nick |location=London, England |archive-date=11 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011165840/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2Fexclusions%2Ffamilyhistory%2Ffheltonjohn.xml |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sir Elton John 'in shock' after his mother dies aged 92 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42220913 |access-date=12 November 2018 |work=BBC News |date=4 December 2017 |archive-date=11 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111180058/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42220913 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sir Elton John's father didn't approve of his career path |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11542512 |access-date=12 November 2018 |work=The New Zealand Herald |archive-date=13 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113030241/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11542512 |url-status=live}}</ref> He was raised in a [[council house]] in Pinner where his maternal grandparents lived.<ref name="55Pinner" /> When he was six, the family moved to a nearby semi-detached house.<ref name="55Pinner">{{cite web |url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/Elton_John_Birthplace |title=55 Pinner Hill Road |publisher=On This Very Spot |date=25 March 1947 |access-date=25 February 2009 |archive-date=15 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115210301/http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/Elton_John_Birthplace |url-status=usurped}}</ref><ref name="Telegraph-detective" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/111_Potter_Street |title=111 Potter Street |publisher=On This Very Spot |date=15 July 2007 |access-date=25 February 2009 |archive-date=6 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406053021/http://www.onthisveryspot.com/spot/111_Potter_Street |url-status=usurped}}</ref> He was educated at Pinner Wood Junior School, Reddiford School and [[Pinner County Grammar School]], until he was 17, when he left just before his [[A-Level]] examinations to pursue a career in music.<ref name="Norman">{{cite book |last=Norman |first=Philip |author-link=Philip Norman (author) |date=1991 |title=Elton John |publisher=Fireside |isbn=0-671-79729-8}}</ref><ref name="Rosenthal">Elizabeth Rosenthal, ''His Song: The Musical Journey of Elton John'', Billboard Books, 2001.</ref><ref name="VisualDoc">{{cite book |title=Elton John: The Visual Documentary |first=Nigel |last=Goodall |year=1993 |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |isbn=0-7119-3078-3}}</ref>

When John began to consider a career in music seriously, his father, who served in the [[Royal Air Force]], tried to steer him toward a more conventional career, such as banking.<ref>London Gazette, various editions.</ref><ref name="Norman" /> John has said that his wild stage costumes and performances were his way of letting go after a restrictive childhood.<ref name="VisualDoc" /> Both his parents were musically inclined, his father having been a trumpet player with the Bob Millar Band, a semi-professional big band that played at military dances.<ref name="VisualDoc" /> The Dwights were keen record buyers, exposing John to the popular singers and musicians of the day.

John started playing his grandmother's piano as a young boy,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/11/15/668291963/watch-elton-john-get-worse-at-the-piano-in-time-traveling-christmas-ad |title=Tear-Jerker British Ad Re-Creates Elton John's Christmas Past |publisher=NPR|access-date=18 November 2018|archive-date=17 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117082406/https://www.npr.org/2018/11/15/668291963/watch-elton-john-get-worse-at-the-piano-in-time-traveling-christmas-ad|url-status=live}}</ref> and within a year his mother heard him picking out [[Waldteufel]]'s "The [[Skater's Waltz]]" by ear.<ref name="Norman" /><ref name="Rosenthal" /> After performing at parties and family gatherings, at age seven, he began formal piano lessons. He showed musical aptitude at school, including the ability to compose melodies, and gained some notoriety by playing like [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] at school functions. At age 11, he won a junior scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. According to one of his instructors, John promptly played back, like a "gramophone record", a four-page piece by [[George Frideric Handel]] after hearing it for the first time.<ref name="Rosenthal" />
[[File:Royal Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|right|Elton John (known then as Reg Dwight) studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London for five years.]]
For the next five years, John attended Saturday classes at the Academy in central London, and he has said he enjoyed playing [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and singing in the choir during Saturday classes, but that he was not otherwise a diligent classical student.<ref name="Rosenthal" /> "I kind of resented going to the Academy," he said. "I was one of those children who could just about get away without practising and still pass, scrape through the grades."<ref name="Rosenthal" /> He has said that he would sometimes skip classes and ride around on the [[London Underground]].<ref name="Rosenthal" /> Several instructors have attested that he was a "model student", and during the last few years he took lessons from a private tutor in addition to his classes at the Academy.<ref name="Rosenthal" /> He left the Academy before taking the final exams.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6455921.stm |title=Sixty things for Sir Elton's 60th |work=BBC News |date=23 March 2007 | access-date= 20 September 2019 | archive-date= 6 May 2021 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210506112406/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6455921.stm | url-status= live}}</ref>

John's mother, though strict with her son, was more outgoing than her husband, and something of a free spirit. With Stanley Dwight uninterested in his son and often absent, John was raised primarily by his mother and maternal grandmother. When his father was home, the Dwights had vehement arguments that greatly distressed John.<ref name="Rosenthal" /> When he was 14, they divorced. His mother then married a local painter, Fred Farebrother, a caring and supportive stepfather whom John affectionately called "Derf" ("Fred" backward).<ref name="Rosenthal" /> They moved into flat No.&nbsp;3A in an eight-unit apartment building called Frome Court, not far from both previous homes. John wrote the songs that launched his career as a rock star, there.

On the advice of music publisher Steve Brown, John and Taupin began writing more complex songs for John to record for DJM. The first was the single "[[I've Been Loving You]]" (1968), produced by [[Caleb Quaye]], Bluesology's former guitarist. In 1969, with Quaye, drummer Roger Pope, and bassist Tony Murray, John recorded another single, "[[Lady Samantha]]", and an album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''. For their follow-up album, ''[[Elton John (album)|Elton John]]'', John and Taupin enlisted [[Gus Dudgeon]] as producer and [[Paul Buckmaster]] as musical arranger. ''Elton John'' was released in April 1970 on DJM Records/[[Pye Records]] in the UK and [[Uni Records]] in the US, and established the formula for subsequent albums: gospel-chorded rockers and poignant ballads. The album's first single, "[[Border Song]]", peaked at 92 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The second, "[[Your Song]]", reached number seven in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number eight in the US, becoming John's first hit single as a singer.<ref name="Charts">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John "Elton John: UK Chart History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214060116/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John|date=14 February 2015}}.

And it's exciting because it's never changed from the first day we wrote songs. I still write the song when he's not there and then I go and play it to him.
