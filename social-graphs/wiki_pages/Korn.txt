'''Korn''' (stylized as '''KoЯn''') is an American [[nu metal]] band from [[Bakersfield, California]], originally formed in 1993 by [[James Shaffer|James "Munky" Shaffer]], [[Reginald Arvizu|Reginald "Fieldy" Arvizu]] and [[David Silveria]], who were members of the band [[L.A.P.D. (band)|L.A.P.D.]] Their current lineup features Shaffer (guitar), [[Brian Welch|Brian "Head" Welch]] (guitar), [[Jonathan Davis]] (vocals), and [[Ray Luzier]] (drums), the last of whom replaced Silveria in 2007. The band is notable for pioneering and popularizing the nu metal genre.

Korn made a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]], ''[[Neidermayer's Mind]]'', in 1993, which was distributed free to record companies and on request to members of the public. Their debut album ''[[Korn (album)|Korn]]'' was released in 1994, followed by their commercial breakthrough, ''[[Life Is Peachy]]'', in 1996. The band first experienced mainstream success with ''[[Follow the Leader (Korn album)|Follow the Leader]]'' (1998) and ''[[Issues (Korn album)|Issues]]'' (1999), both of which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band's mainstream success continued with ''[[Untouchables (album)|Untouchables]]'' (2002); ''[[Take a Look in the Mirror]]'' (2003); and ''[[See You on the Other Side (Korn album)|See You on the Other Side]]'' (2005).

A [[compilation album]], ''[[Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 (Korn album)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1]]'', was released in 2004, spanning a decade of singles and concluding the band's recording contract with [[Immortal Records]] and [[Epic Records]]. They signed to [[Virgin Records]], releasing ''[[See You on the Other Side (Korn album)|See You on the Other Side]]'' in 2005, and an [[Untitled Korn album|untitled album]] in 2007. The band's other recent albums, ''[[Korn III: Remember Who You Are]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Path of Totality]]'' (2011), were released via [[Roadrunner Records]], with ''[[The Paradigm Shift]]'' (2013) being released via [[Prospect Park (production company)|Prospect Park]] and [[Caroline Records]]. ''[[The Serenity of Suffering]]'' (2016) saw their return to Roadrunner Records, through which ''[[The Nothing (Korn album)|The Nothing]]'' was released on September 13, 2019. Their latest album, ''[[Requiem (Korn album)|Requiem]]'', was released via [[Loma Vista Recordings]] on February 4, 2022.

As of 2021, Korn had sold more than 40 million records worldwide. Several of their releases have been certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Fourteen of the band's official releases have peaked in the top ten of the ''Billboard'' 200, eight of which have peaked in the top five. Korn has earned two [[Grammy Award]]s out of eight nominations and two [[MTV Video Music Awards]] out of 11 nominations. Several of their music videos received substantial play on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]'', and were among the first to be retired on the show, including "[[Got the Life]]" and "[[Freak on a Leash]]".

Before Korn was formed, three of the original members of the band were associated with the band [[L.A.P.D.

}}
When thinking of a band name, someone suggested "corn", but the band rejected that name, but Shaffer later had the idea to spell the name with a "K" instead of a "C", and a backwards "R", so the band's name would appear as "KoЯn".{{sfn|Arvizu|2009|pp=53–71}} The idea of using a backwards "R" came from the logo of toy retailer [[Toys R Us]], for which many of the band members had previously worked.{{sfn|Arvizu|2009|pp=53–71}} Silveria explained the logo, designed by Davis, "the music makes the name, because Korn's a dumb name. But once we get established, it makes the name cool."{{sfn|Small|1998|p=16}}

Korn rented a studio from Jeff Creath called Underground Chicken Sound, in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. While they were recording there, a crowd had been [[loitering]] outside the studio.{{sfn|Arvizu|2009|p=63}} The band began playing a prelude to a later song "[[Clown (Korn song)|Clown]]", attracting a larger crowd. Arvizu said the crowd gathered because it sounded so "different."{{sfn|Arvizu|2009|p=64}} Korn started performing at gigs in the summer of 1993, with members saying that touring was a "pain-in-the-ass." While in Huntington Beach, the band was spotted by [[Immortal Records]] [[A&R]] employee Paul Pontius. Pontius would describe Korn's sound as "the new genre of rock." In 1993, Korn released their first [[demo album]], ''[[Neidermayer's Mind]],'' which had very limited printing. It was not well received by critics or the public.{{Why|date=January 2025}}{{sfn|Small|1998|p=16}} It was released to [[record company|record companies]] and to people who filled out a flyer given out at gigs they played for free with [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] and [[House of Pain]].{{sfn|Small|1998|p=16}} With this demo, Korn pioneered the nu metal sound, riffs, and rhythm.{{sfn|McIver|2002|pp=10; 12|loc=How did we get to nu-metal from old metal?}}<ref name=Unterberger2004>{{cite journal|last=Unterberger |first=Andrew|title=Top Ten Nu-Metal Bands|date=September 10, 2004 |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1220 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009181930/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/feature.php?ID=1220 |journal=Stylus Magazine |archive-date=October 9, 2004|access-date=September 25, 2014}}</ref>

After the band finished recording the album, they began touring with Biohazard and House of Pain. Their record company gave them enough money for their own tour bus.

In his first online interview of 2021, [[Brian Welch]] revealed that the band had plans for 2021 but was coy about what they were, hinting it had something to do with touring in a powerful way.<ref>{{cite web|last=Aarons|first=Ricky|date=2021-01-19|title=Brian 'Head' Welch – 'Love And Death With A Side of KoRn, Please'|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2021/01/20/brian-head-welch-love-and-death-with-a-side-of-korn-please/|access-date=2021-01-19|website=Wall of Sound|language=en-US|archive-date=August 10, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230810235751/https://wallofsoundau.com/2021/01/20/brian-head-welch-love-and-death-with-a-side-of-korn-please/|url-status=live}}</ref> On April 24, 2021, Korn released a one-off, online streaming event entitled ''Monumental'' that was filmed on the top of a parking structure at the ''Stranger Things: A Drive-Into Experience'' set in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://riffmagazine.com/reviews/korn-20210424/|title=Review: Korn lights up the sky on electrifying 'Monumental' stream|website=Riff Magazine|first=Mike|last=DeWald|date=April 24, 2021|access-date=May 22, 2021|archive-date=April 6, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406041113/https://riffmagazine.com/reviews/korn-20210424/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historically, when ''Life Is Peachy'' was released, the band's music was not yet labeled "nu metal". Thus, in November 1996, Korn was described as "one of the key players in an American metal revival" alongside Deftones, "two bands that share the same roots".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Portnoy |first=Olivier |date=November 1996 |title=Korn: Voyage en Schizophrénie |trans-title=Korn: Journey Through Schizophrenia |department=Interview |magazine=R.A.G.E. magazine |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=MLP |issue=21 |page=46 |issn=1247-2190}}</ref> In the music community, there have been disagreements whether the band should be considered as "heavy metal". In 2015, lead singer Jonathan Davis commented, "Yeah, we're heavy and downtuned, but metal, to me, is like [[Judas Priest]] and [[Iron Maiden]], that's metal man. I always thought of us as a [[funk]] band."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/rank-your-records-korn/|title=Rank Your Records: Korn's Jonathan Davis Rates the Band's 11 Albums|work=NOISEY|date=March 26, 2015 |access-date=December 16, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119224711/http://noisey.vice.com/blog/rank-your-records-korn|archive-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref> Additionally, in an interview with [[Metal Hammer]], Davis said that he had hated the "nu metal" tag. Korn is widely credited as the originators of the nu metal scene. It means that the genre was suddenly inundated with imitators of their sound.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/jonathan-davis-on-why-he-hated-korn-being-called-nu-metal-you-dont-call-metallica-some-thrash-band |title=Jonathan Davis on why he hated Korn being called nu metal: "you don't call Metallica some thrash band!" |publisher=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=November 15, 2022 |access-date=March 12, 2023 |archive-date=March 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230312071254/https://www.loudersound.com/news/jonathan-davis-on-why-he-hated-korn-being-called-nu-metal-you-dont-call-metallica-some-thrash-band |url-status=live }}</ref>

Bassist Reginald Arvizu plays his instrument using both the techniques of [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerstyle]] and [[Slapping (music)|slapping]]. Jonathan Davis was said by author Doug Small to be "the eye of the storm around which the music of Korn rages."{{sfn|Small|1998|p=5}} Small described the band as "a basket-case full of contradictions."{{sfn|Small|1998|p=5}}

===Lyrical themes===
Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song "[[Daddy (Korn song)|Daddy]]" was described by lead singer [[Jonathan Davis]]: "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really like to talk about that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..."{{sfn|Arnopp|2001|pp=6–7}}<ref>{{cite news|date=November 26, 2009 |url=http://article.wn.com/view/2009/11/26/Courtney_Love_claims_Britney_was_molested_by_her_father_i/ |title=Courtney Love claims Britney was molested by her father |publisher=WorldNews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315093009/http://article.wn.com/view/2009/11/26/Courtney_Love_claims_Britney_was_molested_by_her_father_i/|archive-date=March 15, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{sfn|Small|1998|p=18}} "Kill You" was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his stepmother.{{sfn|Small|1998|p=10}} ''Follow the Leader'' marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like "Justin" and "Pretty" written about incidents occurring during adulthood.{{sfn|Small|1998|p=58}}

(band)|L.A.P.D.]]), alongside friend Brian "Head" Welch, all had the common influences of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and especially the [[Faith No More]] album ''[[The Real Thing (Faith No More album)|The Real Thing]]''.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|access-date=March 12, 2021|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-01-19-ca-26487-story.html|publication-date=January 19, 1996|title=Turning a Big Korner : Bright Year Seen for H.B.-Based Band as Album Sales Boom|first=Mike|last=Boehm|author-link=Mike Boehm|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 19, 1996|archive-date=May 27, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220527200200/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-01-19-ca-26487-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=rgh/> Likewise, Davis was greatly inspired by the adventurousness of ''The Real Thing'' upon its 1989 release: "It showed everybody you could do heavy music and not be 'metal'. It was something completely different."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/faith-no-more-get-praise-from-deftones-slipknot-system-of-a-down-and-more/11696753-all#YVllR8QgGhvxsmZE.99|title=Faith No More Get Praise from Deftones, Slipknot, System of a Down and More|website=[[Artistdirect]]|first=Rick |last=Florino|publication-date=May 5, 2015|access-date=March 12, 2021|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510202223/http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/faith-no-more-get-praise-from-deftones-slipknot-system-of-a-down-and-more/11696753-all|archive-date=May 10, 2015 }}</ref>

In the ''Guitar World'' section "The Album that Changed My Life" of January 1997, Welch listed ''The Real Thing'' by Faith No More as the album that changed his life, while Arvizu named both the Red Hot Chili Peppers' ''[[Freaky Styley]]'' and Faith No More's ''[[Introduce Yourself]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/GuitarWorldJanuary1997/page/n93|publication-date=January 1997|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|title="The Album that Changed My Life"|volume=17|number=1|page=96}}</ref> Fieldy's biggest bass influences were [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] from Red Hot Chili Peppers and [[Les Claypool]] from [[Primus (band)|Primus]].

Munky later acknowledged the song structures and instrumentations of Faith No More in inspiring Korn's future songwriting: "Faith No More steered us in the direction where we ultimately ended up."<ref name="uti" /> They became "fanatics" of Faith No More singer [[Mike Patton]], researched about him, and traveled to the band's hometown of San Francisco in order to watch them play. In this way, they discovered Patton's [[avant-garde music|avant-garde metal]] band [[Mr. Bungle]], whose [[Mr. Bungle (album)|1991 self-titled album]] had a long-standing impact on Korn's experimentation, dissonance, and eccentric stylings.<ref name="rgh" /><ref name="uti">{{cite web |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/opinion/under-the-influence-korns-james-munky-shaffer |title=Under the Influence: Korn's James "Munky" Shaffer |work=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]] |last=Kerr |first=Dave |date=January 6, 2015 |access-date=April 10, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624014512/http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/opinion/under-the-influence-korns-james-munky-shaffer|archive-date=June 24, 2015}}</ref> A notable example of Bungle's influence has been what Korn dubbed the "Mr. Bungle chord" (a flat fifth chord or "[[tritone]]"), which became a band trademark throughout their discography.<ref name="rgh" /><ref>{{cite magazine|publication-date=June 1997 |title=Kornography|first=Nick |last=Bowcott|website=[[Guitar World]]}}</ref> Many reviewers point out stark similarities between the vocals of Davis and several techniques employed by Patton, such as those from ''Angel Dust''.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=March 12, 2021|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2314-irony-is-a-dead-scene-ep/|date=December 2, 2002|title= The Dillinger Escape Plan / Mike Patton: ''Irony Is a Dead Scene EP''|last=Haywood|first=Brad |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|quote=Love him or leave him, Patton's influence on underground metal and hardcore, particularly through Faith No More, is undeniable.

Besides the projects of Patton, Korn had a wide range of influences that included [[Groove (music)|groove]]-oriented metal acts such as [[Sepultura]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]], and [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], in addition to the dynamics and live performances of [[Rage Against the Machine]] and its frontman [[Zack de la Rocha]].

Guitarist Munky and Head described their admiration for [[Steve Vai]]’s ability to "make the guitar talk," saying it inspired how they approached tone and expression. Head specifically pointed out that Munky’s fascination with Vai’s 7‑string work led him to get one, and eventually Head followed suit. That low-register sound helped define Korn’s signature groove, a musical shift they credit directly to Vai.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/features/korn-munky-head-requiem|title=Korn's James 'Munky' Shaffer and Brian 'Head' Welch: "We love making weird noises – filling that synthy space using our guitars is something we love doing"|author1=Amit Sharma|date=April 18, 2022|website=Guitarworld.com|access-date=August 11, 2025}}</ref>
