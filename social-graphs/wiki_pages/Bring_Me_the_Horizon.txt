'''Bring Me the Horizon''' are <!-- Per WP:ENGVAR, British English treats collective nouns plural. Please don't change this to "is" without discussion on the talk page (click "talk" tab at top of page). --> a British [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Sheffield]], England in 2004. The group currently consists of lead vocalist [[Oli Sykes]], drummer [[Matt Nicholls]], guitarist [[Lee Malia]] and bassist [[Matt Kean (musician)|Matt Kean]]. They are signed to [[RCA Records]] globally and [[Columbia Records]] exclusively in the United States.

The band released their debut album ''[[Count Your Blessings (Bring Me the Horizon album)|Count Your Blessings]]'' in 2006. The album featured a deathcore sound that the band would move away from starting with their second album ''[[Suicide Season]]'' (2008). The album was considered a creative, critical and commercial turning point for the band. Bring Me the Horizon released their third album, ''[[There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven Let's Keep It a Secret.]]'', in 2010, propelling them to greater international fame, whilst incorporating influences from [[classical music]], [[electronica]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Their major label debut, ''[[Sempiternal (album)|Sempiternal]]'', (2013) achieved Gold certification in Australia (35,000) and Silver in the United Kingdom (60,000). ''[[That's the Spirit]]'' (2015) debuted at number two in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Liv|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/stereophonics-bag-sixth-number-1-album-with-keep-the-village-alive-thank-you-all-__10769/|title=Stereophonics bag sixth Number 1 album: "Thank you all"|work=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=1 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918161819/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/stereophonics-bag-sixth-number-1-album-with-keep-the-village-alive-thank-you-all-__10769/|archive-date=18 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizons-thats-the-spirit-lands-at-no-2-on-the-billboard-200-chart/|title=Bring Me the Horizon's 'That's The Spirit' Lands At No. 2 On The Billboard 200 Chart|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=1 April 2017|access-date=1 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630211854/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizons-thats-the-spirit-lands-at-no-2-on-the-billboard-200-chart/|archive-date=30 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Their sixth studio album ''[[Amo (Bring Me the Horizon album)|Amo]]'' (2019) became their first UK chart-topper. In the same year, the band also released ''[[Music to Listen To...]]'' (2019). ''[[Post Human: Survival Horror]]'' followed in 2020, the first in a planned series of four projects under the ''Post Human'' name, with the second installment, ''[[Post Human: Nex Gen]]'', released as their seventh studio album in May 2024. The band have also released two extended plays and two live albums. They have received [[List of Kerrang! Award winners|seven]] [[Kerrang! Awards|''Kerrang!'' Awards]], including two for Best British Band and one for Best Live Band, a [[Brit Award for British Rock/Alternative Act|BRIT Award for Best Rock/Alternative Act]] and have been nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s. The band has sold over 5 million records worldwide, and have [[List of artists by number of UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart number ones|topped the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart]] with songs such as "[[Throne (song)|Throne]]", "[[Drown (Bring Me the Horizon song)|Drown]]", "[[Mantra (Bring Me the Horizon song)|Mantra]]", "[[Parasite Eve (song)|Parasite Eve]]", "[[Teardrops (Bring Me the Horizon song)|Teardrops]]", and "[[Kool-Aid (song)|Kool-Aid]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sonymusic.co.uk/artist/bring-me-the-horizon/|title=Bring Me The Horizon|work=[[Sony Music]]|access-date=11 May 2022|archive-date=26 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220626074438/https://www.sonymusic.co.uk/artist/bring-me-the-horizon/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The style of their early work, including their debut album ''Count Your Blessings'', has been described primarily as [[deathcore]], but over the course of several albums, the band has shifted its style and moved in a more melodically-orientated direction by combining their approach to metalcore with elements of [[electronica]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Lukas|last=Wojcicki|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/bring_me_the_horizon-amo|title=Bring Me the Horizon amo|work=[[Exclaim!]]|date=24 January 2019|access-date=24 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929134801/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/bring_me_the_horizon-amo|archive-date=29 September 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="loudwire">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/why-did-bring-me-the-horizon-go-pop/|title=Why Did Bring Me the Horizon Go Pop?|work=[[Loudwire]]|date=25 January 2019|access-date=25 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211102005628/https://loudwire.com/why-did-bring-me-the-horizon-go-pop/|archive-date=2 November 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and early releases (2002–2006)===
<!-- The use of 2002 instead of 2004 in the title is to point out any information about the members prior to the formation of the band. Example article: The Clash -->
{{Main|This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For}}
Bring Me the Horizon's founding members came from diverse musical backgrounds within metal and rock. [[Matt Nicholls]] and [[Oliver Sykes]] had a common interest in American [[metalcore]] such as [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]] and [[Skycamefalling]], and used to attend local [[hardcore punk]] shows. They later met [[Lee Malia]], who spoke with them about [[thrash metal]] and [[melodic death metal]] bands like [[Metallica]] and [[At the Gates]]; Malia had also been part of a Metallica tribute band before meeting the pair.{{sfn|Patterson|2011|p=45}} Bring Me the Horizon officially formed in March 2004, when the members were aged 15 to 17.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=50}} Curtis Ward, who also lived in the [[Rotherham]] area, joined Sykes, Nicholls and Malia on drums. Bassist [[Matt Kean (musician)|Matt Kean]], who was in other local bands, completed the line-up.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} Their name is taken from a line of dialogue spoken by [[Captain Jack Sparrow]] in the 2003 film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', in which Sparrow says: "Now, bring me that horizon."<ref name="spin nov2010">{{cite magazine|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.spin.com/2010/11/why-theyre-called-bring-me-horizon/|title=Why They're Called...

In the months following their formation, Bring Me the Horizon created a demo album titled ''Bedroom Sessions''. They followed this by releasing their first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For]]'', in September 2004 through local UK label Thirty Days of Night Records.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} Bring Me the Horizon were the label's first signing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/directory/labels/Thirty_Days_Of_Night_Records|title=Thirty Days Of Night Records|work=[[Drowned in Sound]]|access-date=6 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214223/http://drownedinsound.com/directory/labels/Thirty_Days_Of_Night_Records|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was recorded at Pristine Studios in Nottingham over the course of two weekends, with drums and bass laid down over the first weekend, and guitars and vocals completed a week later.<ref name="rockfreaks 1">{{cite web|first=Aleksi|last=Pertola|url=http://www.rockfreaks.net/interviews/225|title=Bring Me the Horizon Bassist Discusses Guitarist's Departure|work=RockFreaks|date=11 February 2011|access-date=2 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406201617/http://www.rockfreaks.net/interviews/225|archive-date=6 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

UK label [[Visible Noise]] noticed the band after the release of their EP,{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} and signed them for a four-album deal, in addition to re-releasing the EP in January 2005.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} The re-release gained the band significant attention, eventually peaking at No. 41 on the UK album charts.<ref name="zobbel.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_B.HTM|title=Chart Log UK Darren B – David Byrne|access-date=30 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226170502/http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_B.HTM|archive-date=26 December 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> The band was later awarded Best British Newcomer at the [[Kerrang!

The band's first tour was supporting [[The Red Chord]] across the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} As with other early tours, they were able to get this slot by tricking venue promoters. Kean and Oliver's mother Carol Sykes were the de facto managers of the band at this time, a role they continued to occupy until 2008.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} For The Red Chord support, Kean emailed promoters and pretended they were opening on all the dates, when they were supposed to play only at their local show. This led them to being booked for the whole tour. In another case, Sykes created an e-mail account in the name of [[Johnny Truant]] vocalist Oliver Mitchell, which he used to contact a promoter requesting Bring Me the Horizon on their tour.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}} Alcohol consumption fuelled their live performances in their early history when the band would get so drunk they vomited on stage and damaged their equipment.{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=65}}

===''Count Your Blessings'' (2006–2007)===
{{Main|Count Your Blessings (Bring Me the Horizon album)|l1=Count Your Blessings}}
[[File:Bring-Me-The-Horizon.jpg|thumb|right|Bring Me the Horizon in Vienna]]
The band released their debut album ''[[Count Your Blessings (Bring Me the Horizon album)|Count Your Blessings]]'' in October 2006 in the United Kingdom<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenewfury.com/this-day-music-history-bring-horizon-debut-full-length-album-count-your-blessings/|title=This Day In Music History: October 30th, 2006 – Bring Me The Horizon releases debut album, 'Count Your Blessings'|work=The New Fury|date=30 October 2006|access-date=1 June 2024}}</ref> and in August 2007 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizon-count-your-blessings-to-receive-u-s-release-in-august/|title=Bring Me The Horizon: 'Count Your Blessings' To Receive U.S. Release In August|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=22 May 2007|access-date=1 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822213857/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizon-count-your-blessings-to-receive-u-s-release-in-august/|archive-date=22 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> They rented a house in the country to write songs, but easily became distracted. They then recorded the album in inner-city Birmingham, a process which was infamous for their excessive and dangerous drinking. During this period drummer Nicholls summarised it saying "we were out every night, just being regular 18-year-olds".{{sfn|Patashnik|2012|p=67}} Critics panned the album adding to the strongly polarised responses the band were already seeing from the public.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=50}}

They supported ''Count Your Blessings'' by going on a lengthy headline tour of the UK in November,<ref name="Dis-party music">{{cite web|first=Raziq|last=Rauf|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/1263353|title=Bring Me The Horizon: "It's just party music"|work=[[Drowned In Sound]]|date=6 November 2006|access-date=7 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014072647/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/1263353|archive-date=14 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and immediately followed this joining [[Lostprophets]] and [[The Blackout (band)|The Blackout]] on a UK tour<ref>{{cite web|first=Caroline|last=Jones|url=http://www.gigwise.com/article.php?contentid=25949|title=Saturday 09/12/06 Lostprophets, Bring Me The Horizon, The Blackout @ Hammersmith Apollo, London|work=[[Gigwise]]|date=13 December 2006|access-date=1 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609025336/http://www.gigwise.com/article.php?contentid=25949|archive-date=9 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> through late November and December 2006.

In January 2007, Bring Me the Horizon were able to set their sights beyond the UK, when they replaced [[Bury Your Dead]] on [[Killswitch Engage]]'s European headline tour. The slot became available after Bury Your Dead were forced to withdraw by the departure from the band of their vocalist, Mat Bruso.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizon-replaces-bury-your-dead-on-killswitch-engage-s-european-tour|title=Bring Me the Horizon Replaces Bury Your Dead On Killswitch Engage's European Tour|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=7 January 2007|access-date=29 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230226090309/https://blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizon-replaces-bury-your-dead-on-killswitch-engage-s-european-tour|archive-date=26 February 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> Bring Me the Horizon's presence on the tour was poorly received by fans of Killswitch Engage, with concert attendees regularly [[Bottling (concert abuse)|throwing bottles]] at the band before they even started playing their set.{{sfn|Ritchie|2012|p=54}}

===''Suicide Season'' and Ward's departure (2008–2009)===
{{Main|Suicide Season}}
Bring Me the Horizon recorded their second studio album, ''[[Suicide Season]]'', in Sweden with producer [[Fredrik Nordström]]. He was unimpressed with their first album and was initially absent from the recording sessions unless he needed to be there. Nordström later heard the new sound they were experimenting with during a recording session and became very involved in the record.{{sfn|Ritchie|2012|p=56}} It was promoted virally in the weeks before its release with the promotional tag line "September is Suicide Season."<ref name="September is Suicide Season">{{cite web|url=http://news.mibba.com/Music/1232/September-Is-Suicide-Season|title=September Is 'Suicide Season'|work=mibba|date=28 July 2008|access-date=18 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007050808/http://news.mibba.com/Music/1232/September-Is-Suicide-Season|archive-date=7 October 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> To promote ''Suicide Season'' the band embarked on their first headline tour of the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epitaph.com/news/article/bring-me-the-horizon-launch-us-tour|title=Bring Me the Horizon Launch U.S. Tour|work=[[Epitaph Records]]|date=29 October 2008|access-date=1 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412222836/https://www.epitaph.com/news/article/bring-me-the-horizon-launch-us-tour|archive-date=12 April 2021|url-status=live}}</ref> as well as appearing at the 2008 [[Warped Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/vans_warped_tour_2008_look_back/|title=A look back at Warped Tour 2008|magazine=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|date=28 February 2018|access-date=1 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231125012728/https://www.altpress.com/vans_warped_tour_2008_look_back/|archive-date=25 November 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> In May 2008, Bring Me the Horizon was the main supporting band on [[I Killed the Prom Queen]]'s farewell Australian tour with [[The Ghost Inside (band)|The Ghost Inside]] and [[The Red Shore]].<ref name="iktpq tour 2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/12509/I-Killed-The-Prom-Queen-farewell-tour|title=I Killed The Prom Queen farewell tour|work=Faster Louder|date=3 March 2008|access-date=18 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315001125/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/12509/I-Killed-The-Prom-Queen-farewell-tour|archive-date=15 March 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Songwriting and recording process===
In all the band's album notes, all of Bring Me the Horizon's lyrics are said to be written by lead vocalist [[Oli Sykes]] while all five members—as a band—were credited with writing the music. With the exception of ''Count Your Blessings'', the band has always written in a secluded location to avoid being distracted.<ref name="UG-Lee Guitar interview"/> Sykes' lyrics have a strong feeling of [[catharsis]] for him. He mainly draws from personal experience and has described the band's live performances as [[therapeutic]].<ref name="CANOE-horizons broadened"/> In 2006, when asked about the lyrics of ''Count Your Blessings'', as they had been criticised for their content solely fixated on [[broken heart|heartbreak]] and other themes that were called "shallow and meaningless", he responded "My life's never been that bad so I've not got that much to talk about."<ref name="Dis-party music"/>
Band members have described how the debut album was written in inner-city areas of [[Birmingham]] while being pressured to write and record songs to the deadlines given.<ref name="rockfreaks 1"/> This resulted in the band being unimpressed with the final product. However, for the writing process of ''Suicide Season'', the band realised that they preferred picking areas with less human contact to focus on the music; they wrote their second album in the Swedish countryside.<ref name="CANOE-expands horizons" /> During the writing of ''Suicide Season'', former and founding rhythm guitarist Curtis Ward wrote only two riffs of his rhythm parts of the album, mostly relying on Lee Malia to write all of the guitar sections of the album.<ref name="rockfreaks 1"/>

Malia has stated that the typical writing process involves Sykes writing the main structure of the songs, followed by Malia writing the main riff. From this, they would collaborate with each other to structure their work better and then later include the rest of the band in writing the rest of the song.<ref name="UG-Lee Guitar interview"/> The writing dynamic of ''Sempiternal'', typically featured Sykes, Malia, and newly introduced member Jordan Fish. According to Sykes, "Writing 'Sempiternal' was a completely different process...we worked from a computer, laying down ideas and riffs...bringing Jordan into the mix changed things completely; he opened up so many more possibilities."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizon-complete-sempiternal-details-revealed|title=Bring Me The Horizon: Complete 'Sempiternal' Details Revealed|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=14 January 2013|access-date=12 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231128110846/https://blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizon-complete-sempiternal-details-revealed|archive-date=28 November 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> As they all took a break before writing their fourth album, they felt less of a need for an isolated writing environment.<ref name="Guardian-2013 interview">{{cite news|first=Ed|last=Cooper|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/02/22/bring-me-the-horizon-this-album-needs-to-be-the-one-that-lasts-forever/|title=Bring Me The Horizon: This album needs to be the one that lasts forever|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=22 February 2013|access-date=26 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023041236/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/02/22/bring-me-the-horizon-this-album-needs-to-be-the-one-that-lasts-forever/|archive-date=23 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The band's image fit into what was called [[scene (subculture)|scene fashion]].{{sfn|Ritchie|2012|p=54}}<ref name="Kerrang 1501"/> The effect of their fashion aesthetics showed people, in show promoter Iain Scott's perspective, that "you don't have to look like a diabolical metalhead to be into metal or play in a metal band".{{sfn|Ritchie|2012|p=54}} However, their fashion conscious appearance earned them a "style over substance" label.{{sfn|Patterson|2011|p=45}}

Many controversies that occurred in their early years greatly affected public perceptions of the band, particularly an incident in 2007 at [[Nottingham]]'s [[Rock City (club)|Rock City]] venue, when a female fan claimed that Oliver Sykes had urinated on her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizon-vocalist-accused-of-urinating-on-fan|title=Bring Me the Horizon Vocalist Accused Of Urinating On Fan|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=15 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024180625/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bring-me-the-horizon-vocalist-accused-of-urinating-on-fan/|archive-date=24 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence from CCTV footage in the area.{{sfn|Patterson|2011|p=47}} There were several documented examples of violence against the band during their live shows, including Sykes being [[pepper spray]]ed on stage;<ref name="RS-classic BFMV"/> and people getting onstage to assault the band.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Scott|last=Heisel|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/bring_me_the_horizon_trade_blows_with_audience_members_in_salt_lake_city|title=Bring Me The Horizon trade blows with audience members in Salt Lake City|magazine=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|date=4 October 2011|access-date=5 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209131017/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/bring_me_the_horizon_trade_blows_with_audience_members_in_salt_lake_city|archive-date=9 December 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Despite the controversy over their image, various journalists have credited the band as being one of the most forward-thinking heavy bands in the UK.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=52}} In 2012, just four years after the release of ''Suicide Season'', the album was inducted into [[Rock Sound]]'s ''Hall of Fame'', credited as a significant influence on the works of [[Asking Alexandria]], The Ghost Inside and [[While She Sleeps]]. It was credited as an influence on metalcore contemporaries Architects on ''[[Hollow Crown]]'' with their incorporation of keyboards and programming, and The Devil Wears Prada's ''[[Dead Throne]]'' for its more experimental and opinion-dividing sound.{{sfn|Ritchie|2012|p=56}} In an interview with ''Kerrang!'', guitarist Lee Malia remarked that the band wanted to go a bit more experimental, saying: "I always think we have been a year ahead of bands who are kind of just seeing what's cool and then copying it."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.kerrang.com/lee-malia-says-bmth-have-always-been-a-year-ahead-of-bands-who-just-copy-whats-cool|title=Lee Malia Says BMTH Have Always Been A Year Ahead Of Bands Who Just Copy What's Cool|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|date=22 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230709175400/https://www.kerrang.com/lee-malia-says-bmth-have-always-been-a-year-ahead-of-bands-who-just-copy-whats-cool|archive-date=9 July 2023|url-status=live}}</ref>

The band caused further controversy in February 2016 when Oliver Sykes trashed [[Coldplay]]'s table at the 2016 [[NME Awards]] during a live performance of Bring Me the Horizon's track "Happy Song".<ref name=":0">{{cite magazine|first=Ryan|last=Reed|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bring-me-the-horizon-destroying-coldplays-nme-table-wasnt-protest-20160219|title=Bring Me the Horizon: Destroying Coldplay's NME Table Wasn't 'Protest'|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=19 February 2016|access-date=20 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220091036/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bring-me-the-horizon-destroying-coldplays-nme-table-wasnt-protest-20160219|archive-date=20 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Sykes later stated that the act was not an act of "dirty protest", and suggested that it was "pure coincidence" that Coldplay were sitting at the table he trampled.<ref name=":0" /> Coldplay frontman [[Chris Martin]] admitted that he had never even heard of Bring Me the Horizon before the incident and he laughed it off, stating that "it was great, very 'rock and roll'".<ref>{{cite web|first=Elijah|last=Watson|url=http://uproxx.com/music/coldplay-bring-me-the-horizon-nme-awards-trashing-table/|title=Watch This Metal Band Trash Coldplay's Table At The 2016 NME Awards|work=UPROXX|date=18 February 2016|access-date=20 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219101937/http://uproxx.com/music/coldplay-bring-me-the-horizon-nme-awards-trashing-table/|archive-date=19 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Another controversy occurred on April 20, 2024, when they posted a promotional ad for the Brisbane show in Australia which read, "If Jesus Christ returns, well just kill that fucker 2X," and caused some backlash among fans.<ref>{{cite web|first=Chad|last=Childers|url=https://loudwire.com/bring-me-the-horizon-slam-band-jesus-comments-concert-promo/|title=Bring Me the Horizon Fans Slam Band Over 'Jesus' Comments In Concert Promo|work=[[Loudwire]]|date=22 April 2024|access-date=14 June 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240510025206/https://loudwire.com/bring-me-the-horizon-slam-band-jesus-comments-concert-promo/|archive-date=10 May 2024|url-status=live}}</ref>
