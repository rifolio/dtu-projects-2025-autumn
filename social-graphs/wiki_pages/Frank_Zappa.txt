'''Frank Vincent Zappa'''{{refn|group="nb"|Until discovering his birth certificate as an adult, Zappa believed he had been christened "Francis Vincent Zappa" after his father, and he is credited as Francis on some of his early albums. However, the name on his birth certificate is "Frank".<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|15}}}} (December 21, 1940&nbsp;– December 4, 1993) was an American composer, songwriter, electric guitarist, conductor, actor, satirist, filmmaker and activist. In a career spanning more than 30&nbsp;years, Zappa composed [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[jazz]], [[jazz fusion]], [[orchestra]]l and ''[[musique concrète]]'' works; he additionally produced nearly all the 60-plus albums he released with his band [[<!--Do not capitalize-->the Mothers of Invention]] and as a solo artist.<ref name="WRAM">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/frank-zappa-mn0000138699/biography|title=Frank Zappa – Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]] |first=William |last=Ruhlmann |access-date=August 8, 2017}}</ref> His work, which predominantly features [[electric guitar]] work, is characterized by [[wikt:nonconformity|nonconformity]], [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]]<ref name="dweezilimprov">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dKh4PRio8g&t=87s |title=Dweezil Zappa Teaches Frank Zappa's Improvisation Techniques |date=2016-12-06 |website=Youtube |publisher=Reverb.com |access-date=2024-04-12 |quote=Zappa regularly used structured improvisation in a Jazz-like context but also occasionally used what he called "spontaneous composition"}}</ref> sound experimentation, [[Virtuoso|musical virtuosity]] and [[satire]] of American culture.<ref name="semley2012"/> Zappa also directed feature-length films and [[music video]]s, and designed album covers.

As a mostly self-taught composer and performer, Zappa had diverse musical influences that led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical [[Modernism (music)|modernism]], African-American [[rhythm and blues]], and [[doo-wop]] music.<ref name="teentastes">{{cite book|last1=Buckley|first1=Peter|title=The Rough Guide to Rock: [The Definitive Guide to More Than 1200 Artists and Bands]|year= 2003|publisher=Rough Guides|location=London|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse/page/1211 1211]|edition=3rd|quote=As a teenager, Zappa was simultaneously enthralled by black R&B (Johnny 'Guitar' Watson, Guitar Slim), doo-wop (The Channels, The Velvets), the modernist 20th century composers, such as Igor Stravinsky, Anton Webern and Edgard Varèse.|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse/page/1211}}</ref> He began writing classical music in high school, while simultaneously playing drums in rhythm-and-blues bands, later switching to electric guitar. His debut studio album with the Mothers of Invention, ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966), combined satirical but seemingly conventional [[rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] songs with extended sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach throughout his career.

Zappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed "Project/Object", with numerous musical phrases, ideas and characters reappearing throughout his albums.<ref name="semley2012"/> His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so, and he has been described as the "godfather" of [[comedy rock]].<ref name="Comedy rock">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/comedy-rock-ma0000012139/artists |title=Comedy rock |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=November 14, 2020}}</ref> He was a strident critic of mainstream education and [[organized religion]], and a forthright and passionate advocate for [[freedom of speech]], [[autodidacticism|self-education]], political participation and the abolition of censorship. Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he disapproved of recreational drug use, but supported decriminalization and regulation.

Zappa was a highly productive and prolific musician with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while detractors found it lacking emotional depth.<ref name="wp">{{cite news|last=Himes|first=Geoffrey|date=December 12, 1993|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1993/12/12/pop-recordings/2e1e34bf-05aa-438b-b2c7-20f8e640600d/|title=Pop Recordings|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref> He had greater commercial success outside the U.S., particularly in Europe. Though he worked as an [[independent music|independent artist]], Zappa mostly relied on distribution agreements he had negotiated with the major [[record label]]s. He remains a major influence on musicians. His many honors include his posthumous 1995 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the 1997 [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

==1940–1965: Early life and career==
===Childhood===
Zappa was born on December 21, 1940, in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, to Rose Marie ({{nee}} Colimore) and Francis Vincent Zappa. He was predominantly of Sicilian descent but also had Greek, Arab and French ancestors.{{refn|group="nb"|"My ancestry is Sicilian, Greek, Arab and French. My mother's mother was French and Sicilian, and her Dad was Italian (from Naples). She was first generation. The Greek-Arab side is from my Dad. He was born in a Sicilian village called Partinico&nbsp;..."<ref name="Occhiogrosso">{{cite book |last1=Zappa |first1=Frank |author-link=Frank Zappa |last2=Occhiogrosso |first2=Peter |title=Real Frank Zappa Book |date=1989 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-70572-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/realfrankzappabo0000zapp}}</ref>{{rp|15}}}}

The eldest of four children, he was raised in an Italian-American household where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|6}}<ref name="Rolling Stone Book">''The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'', 1993.</ref> The family moved often because his father, a [[chemist]] and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in [[Florida]] in the 1940s, the family returned to [[Maryland]], where Zappa's father worked at the [[Edgewood Arsenal]] [[chemical warfare]] facility of the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] run by the [[U.S. Army]]. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored [[mustard gas]], gas masks were kept in the home in case of an accident.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|20–23}} This living arrangement had a profound effect on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare, ailments and the defense industry occur frequently throughout his work.<ref name="miles">{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa| first = Barry| last = Miles| publisher=Atlantic Books| location = London| date = 2004|isbn = 978-1-84354-092-2}}</ref>{{rp|8–9}}

Zappa's father often brought [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-filled lab equipment home from his workplace and gave it to Zappa to play with.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|19}}  Zappa said that as a child he "used to play with it all the time", often by putting liquid mercury on the floor and using a hammer to spray out mercury droplets in a circular pattern, eventually covering the entire floor of his bedroom with them.<ref>{{cite book |title=Real Frank Zappa Book |date=1989 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-70572-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FB0O_HCpBy0C&pg=PA19 |access-date=May 1, 2022}}</ref>

Zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from [[asthma]], [[earache]]s and [[Paranasal sinuses|sinus]] problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of [[radium]] into each of Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation and mercury exposure.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|10}}

Nasal imagery and references appear in his music and lyrics, as well as in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator [[Cal Schenkel]]. Zappa believed his childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas released by the nearby chemical warfare facility, and his health worsened when he lived in Baltimore.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|20–23}}<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|10}} In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health to [[Monterey, California]], where his father taught [[metallurgy]] at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]].<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|22}} They soon moved to the [[San Diego]] neighborhood of [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]],<ref name="slaven03">{{cite book |title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story of Frank Zappa |edition=2nd |first1=Neil |last1=Slaven |publisher=Music Sales Group|date=2003|isbn=978-0-7119-9436-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4EyfFjQ3DgC}}</ref>{{rp|46}} and then to the nearby city of [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]], before finally returning to San Diego.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sandiegotroubadour.com/wp-content/pdf/2005_11_Nov.pdf|title=Counter Culture Coincidence|work=San Diego Troubadour|last=Mendoza|first=Bart|page=4|date=November 11, 2005|access-date=September 11, 2010}}</ref>

===First musical interests===
{{quote box|quote=Since I didn't have any kind of formal training, it didn't make any difference to me if I was listening to [[Lightnin' Slim]], or a vocal group called the Jewels&nbsp;..., or [[Webern]], or [[Varèse]], or [[Stravinsky]]. To me it was all good music.|source= — Frank Zappa, 1989<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|34}}|width=25em}}

At the age of 12, Zappa started learning [[drum rudiment]]s at a summer school group course in Monterey, California with a teacher named Keith McKillop. Frank said "Instead of drums, he had us practicing on wooden planks."<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|13}} Zappa joined his first band at [[Mission Bay High School]] in San Diego as a drummer.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|29}} At about the same time, his parents bought a [[phonograph]], which allowed him to develop his interest in music, and to begin building his record collection.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|22}} According to ''[[Rough Guide|The Rough Guide to Rock]]'' (2003), "as a teenager Zappa was simultaneously enthralled by black R&B ([[Johnny "Guitar" Watson|Johnny 'Guitar' Watson]], [[Guitar Slim]]), doo-wop ([[The Channels]], [[The Velvets]]), and modern composers, such as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Edgard Varèse]]."<ref name="teentastes"/>

R&B singles were early purchases for Zappa, starting a large collection he kept for the rest of his life.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|36}} He was interested in sounds for their own sake, particularly the sounds of drums and other percussion instruments. By age twelve, he had obtained a snare drum and began learning the basics of orchestral percussion.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|29}} Zappa's deep interest in modern classical music began<ref name="idol"/> when he read a ''[[Look (American magazine)|LOOK]]'' magazine article about the [[Sam Goody]] record store chain that lauded its ability to sell an LP as obscure as ''The Complete Works of Edgard Varèse, Volume One''.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|30–33}} The article described Varèse's percussion composition ''[[Ionisation (Varèse)|Ionisation]]'', produced by [[EMS Recordings]], as "a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds". Zappa decided to seek out Varèse's music. After searching for over a year, Zappa found a copy (he noticed the LP because of the "mad scientist" looking photo of Varèse on the cover). Not having enough money with him, he persuaded the salesman to sell him the record at a discount.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|30–33}} Thus began his lifelong passion for Varèse's music and that of other modern classical composers. He also liked the Italian classical music listened to by his grandparents, especially [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s opera arias.

By 1956, the Zappa family had moved to [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], a small [[aerospace]] and farming town in the [[Antelope Valley]] of the [[Mojave Desert]] close to [[Edwards Air Force Base]]; he would later refer to Sun Village (a town close to Lancaster) in the 1973 track "Village of the Sun".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/lyrics/Roxy_and_Elsewhere.html#Village|title=Lyrics of Village Of The Sun|first=Frank|last=Zappa|date=December 1973|work=Village Of The Sun, Roxy and Elsewhere|access-date=October 20, 2016}}</ref> Zappa's mother encouraged him in his musical interests. Although she disliked Varèse's music, she was indulgent enough to give her son a long-distance call to the New York composer as a fifteenth birthday present.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|30–33}} Unfortunately, Varèse was in Europe at the time, so Zappa spoke to the [[Louise Varèse|composer's wife]] and she suggested he call back later. In a letter, Varèse thanked him for his interest, and told him about a composition he was working on called "[[Déserts]]". Living in the desert town of Lancaster, Zappa found this very exciting. Varèse invited him to visit if he ever came to New York. The meeting never took place (Varèse died in 1965), but Zappa framed the letter and kept it on display for the rest of his life.<ref name="idol">{{cite journal |last=Zappa |first=Frank |date=June 1971 |title=Edgard Varèse: The Idol of My Youth |url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Audio/Archive-HiFI-Stereo/70s/HiFi-Stereo-Review-1971-06.pdf |journal=Stereo Review |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=62–68 |via=World Radio History}}</ref>{{refn|group="nb"|On several of his earlier albums, Zappa paid tribute to Varèse by quoting his: "The present-day composer refuses to die."<ref>{{cite book|title=Friendly Remainders: Essays in Music Criticism after Adorno|first1=Murray|last1=Dineen|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|date=2011|isbn=978-0-7735-8576-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WV1ta5rlm58C&pg=PA122 122] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV1ta5rlm58C }}</ref>}}

At [[Antelope Valley High School]], Zappa met Don Glen Vliet (who later changed his name to Don Van Vliet and adopted the stage name [[Captain Beefheart]]). Zappa and Vliet became close friends, sharing an interest in R&B records and influencing each other musically throughout their careers.<ref name="slaven03"/>{{rp|29–30}} Around the same time, Zappa started playing drums in a local band, the Blackouts.<ref name="watson96"/>{{rp|13}} The band was racially diverse and included [[Jim Sherwood|Euclid James "Motorhead" Sherwood]] who later became a member of the Mothers of Invention. Zappa's interest in the guitar grew, and in 1957 he was given his first instrument. Among his early influences were [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]], [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]]. In the 1970s/1980s, he invited Watson to perform on several albums. Zappa considered soloing the equivalent of forming "air sculptures",<ref>{{cite book|title=Frank Zappa|first1=Barry|last1=Miles|publisher=Atlantic Books Ltd|date=2014|isbn=978-1-78239-678-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=A5jCBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT266 266] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5jCBAAAQBAJ}}</ref> and developed an eclectic, innovative and highly personal style.<ref>{{cite book|title=Academy Zappa: Proceedings of the First International Conference of Esemplastic Zappology (ICE-Z)|edition=illusdtrated|first1=Ben|last1=Watson|first2=Esther|last2=Leslie|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|date=2005|isbn=978-0-946719-79-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NBfhgQf1-QwC&pg=PA223 223] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBfhgQf1-QwC}}</ref> He was also influenced by Egyptian composer [[Halim El-Dabh]].<ref name="Holmes">{{cite book|title=Electronic and experimental music: technology, music, and culture|first=Thom|last=Holmes|edition=3rd|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|date=2008|isbn=978-0-415-95781-6|chapter=Early Synthesizers and Experimenters|pages=153–154|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCthQ-bec-QC&pg=PA153|access-date=June 4, 2011}}</ref>

Zappa's interest in composing and arranging flourished in his last high school years. By his final year, he was writing, [[arrangement|arranging]] and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|40}} He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album ''[[Freak Out!]]''<ref name="walley80"/>{{rp|23}} Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting the rest of the class with juvenile antics.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|48}} In 1959, he attended [[Chaffey College]] but left after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|345}} While in college, Zappa met [[Terry Kirkman]] and played gigs at local [[coffee house]]s with him.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Searles |first=Malcolm C. |title=The Association 'Cherish' |date=October 5, 2018 |publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd |isbn=978-1-78901-361-0 |pages=7 |language=English}}</ref>

Zappa left home in 1959, and moved into a small apartment in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles]]. After he met Kathryn J. "Kay" Sherman during his short period of private composition study with Prof. [[Karl Kohn]] of [[Pomona College]], they moved in together in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-12-21 |title=Frank Zappa zig-zagged around downtown Ontario in early 1960s |url=https://www.dailybulletin.com/2019/12/21/frank-zappa-zig-zagged-around-downtown-ontario-in-early-1960s/ |access-date=2025-04-16 |website=Daily Bulletin |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-01-10 |title=Frank Zappa once shared pizza and advice with Ontario teen band |url=https://www.dailybulletin.com/2021/01/10/frank-zappa-once-shared-pizza-and-advice-with-ontario-teen-band/ |access-date=2025-04-16 |website=Daily Bulletin |language=en-US}}</ref> and were married December 28, 1960.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|58}} Zappa worked for a short period in advertising as a copywriter.

===Studio Z===
Zappa attempted to earn a living as a musician and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with a new version of the Blackouts.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|59}} Zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films ''[[The World's Greatest Sinner]]'' (1962) and ''[[Run Home, Slow]]'' (1965) were more financially rewarding. The former score was commissioned by actor-producer [[Timothy Carey]] and recorded in 1961. It contains many themes that appeared on later Zappa records.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|63}} The latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of Zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and Zappa may have worked on it before the film was shot.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|55}} Excerpts from the soundtrack can be heard on the posthumous album ''[[The Lost Episodes]]'' (1996).

During the early 1960s, Zappa wrote and produced songs for other local artists, often working with singer-songwriter [[Ray Collins (musician)|Ray Collins]] and producer Paul Buff. Their "[[Memories of El Monte]]" was recorded by [[the Penguins]], although only Cleve Duncan of the original group was featured.<ref>Gray, 1984, ''Mother!'', p. 29.</ref> Buff owned the small [[Pal Recording Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Cucamonga]], which included a unique five-track tape recorder he had built. At that time, only a handful of the most sophisticated commercial studios had [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] facilities; the industry standard for smaller studios was still mono or two-track.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|42}} Although none of the recordings from the period achieved major commercial success, Zappa earned enough money to allow him in 1963 to stage a concert of his orchestral music and to broadcast and record it.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|74}} In March of that same year Zappa appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s syndicated late night show playing a bicycle as a musical {{nowrap|instrument<ref>{{cite web |title=Video footage of Frank Zappa performing music on a bicycle on Steve Allen's Show in 1963 |url=https://twitter.com/SkotArmstrong/status/1473331952929296384 |website=Twitter feed of Skot Armstrong |publisher=[[Twitter]] |access-date=December 21, 2021}}</ref><ref name="slaven96">{{cite book |first=Neil |last=Slaven |date=1996 |title=Electric Don Quixote |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=978-0711959835}}</ref>{{rp|35–36}}{{mdash}}}}{{hsp}}using drum sticks and a bow borrowed from the band's bass player he proceeded to pluck, bang, and bow the spokes of the bike, producing strange, comical sounds from his newfound instrument. With Captain Beefheart, Zappa recorded some songs under the name of the Soots. They were rejected by [[Dot Records]]. Later, the Mothers were also rejected by [[Columbia Records]] for having "no commercial potential", a verdict Zappa subsequently quoted on the sleeve of ''[[Freak Out!]]''<ref name="watson96">{{cite book| title = Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play| first = Ben| last = Watson| date = 1996| publisher=St. Martin's Griffin| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-312-14124-0}}</ref>{{rp|27}}

In 1964, after his marriage started to break up, he moved into the Pal studio and began routinely working 12&nbsp;hours or more per day recording and experimenting with [[overdubbing]] and [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording#As a musical instrument|audio tape manipulation]]. This established a work pattern that endured for most of his life.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|43}} Aided by his income from film composing, Zappa took over the studio from Paul Buff, who was now working with [[Art Laboe]] at [[Original Sound]]. It was renamed Studio Z.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|80–81}} Studio Z was rarely booked for recordings by other musicians. Instead, friends moved in, notably James "Motorhead" Sherwood.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|82–83}} Zappa started performing in local bars as a guitarist with a [[power trio]], the Muthers, to support himself.<ref name="watson96"/>{{rp|26}}

==1965–1970: The Mothers of Invention==
===Formation===
By April 1965, [[Ray Collins (musician)|Ray Collins]], one of Zappa's friends during the early Studio Z days, was the singer of an R&B band called the Soul Giants, based in [[Pomona, California]]. That month, he asked Zappa to take over as guitarist in the Soul Giants, following a fight between Collins and the group's original guitarist.<ref name="Rolling Stone Book"/> Zappa accepted, and soon assumed leadership and the role as co-lead singer (even though he never considered himself a singer, then or later<ref name="HighTimes1980"/>). He convinced the other members that they should play his music to increase the chances of getting a record contract.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|65–66}} The band - comprising Zappa, Collins, [[Roy Estrada]], and [[Jimmy Carl Black]] - debuted at the Broadside Club and was renamed the Mothers since this gig took place on May 10, 1965{{snd}}[[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]].<ref name="slaven03"/>{{rp|42}} They increased their bookings after beginning an association with manager [[Herb Cohen]], and gradually gained attention on the burgeoning Los Angeles [[underground music]] scene.<ref name="walley80"/>{{rp|58}} In early 1966, they were spotted by leading record producer [[Tom Wilson (record producer)|Tom Wilson]] when playing "Trouble Every Day", a song about the [[Watts riots]].<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|103}} Wilson had earned acclaim as the producer for [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Simon & Garfunkel]], and was one of the few African-Americans working as a major label pop music producer at this time. Wilson signed the Mothers to the [[Verve Records|Verve]] division of [[MGM Records|MGM]], which had built up a strong reputation for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences. Verve insisted that the band officially rename themselves [[the Mothers of Invention]] as ''Mother'' was short for ''[[motherfucker]]''—a term that, apart from its profane meanings, can denote a skilled musician.<ref>{{cite news | author=<!-- not stated --> | title = BBC Late Show: Frank Zappa interview with Nigel Leigh | medium = TV Show | publisher = [[BBC]] | location = [[UMRK]], Los Angeles, California |date=11 March 1993}}</ref> Under Zappa's leadership, the Mothers' lineup would be ever-changing during their time together, with members including Collins, Estrada, Black, [[Elliot Ingber]], brothers [[Bunk Gardner|Bunk]] and [[Buzz Gardner]], [[Don Preston]], [[Billy Mundi]], [[Jim Fielder]], [[Jim Sherwood|Jim "Motorhead" Sherwood]], [[Ian Underwood]], [[Art Tripp]], and [[Lowell George]].

===Debut album: ''Freak Out!''===
{{See also|Freak Out!|Absolutely Free|Lumpy Gravy}}
With Wilson credited as producer, the Mothers of Invention, augmented by a studio orchestra, recorded the groundbreaking ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966), which, after Bob Dylan's ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'', was the second rock [[double album]] ever released. It mixed R&B, [[doo-wop]], [[musique concrète]],<ref name="lowe">{{cite book| title = The Words and Music of Frank Zappa| first = Kelly Fisher| last = Lowe| publisher=Praeger Publishers| location = Westport| date = 2006| isbn = 978-0-275-98779-4}}</ref>{{rp|25}} and experimental [[sound collage]]s that captured the "freak" subculture of Los Angeles at that time.<ref name="walley80"/>{{rp|60–61}} Although he was dissatisfied with the final product, ''Freak Out'' immediately established Zappa as a radical new voice in rock music, providing an antidote to the "relentless consumer culture of America".<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|115}} The sound was raw, but the arrangements were sophisticated. While recording in the studio, some of the additional [[session musician]]s were shocked that they were expected to read the notes on sheet music from [[Chord chart|charts]] with Zappa conducting them, since it was not standard when recording rock music.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|112}} The lyrics praised non-conformity, disparaged authorities, and had [[dada]]ist elements.

Wilson provided the industry clout and connections and was able to provide the group with the financial resources needed.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|123}} Although Wilson was able to provide Zappa and the Mothers with an extraordinary degree of artistic freedom for the time, the recording did not go entirely as planned. In a 1967 radio interview, Zappa explained that the album's outlandish 11-minute closing track, "Return of the Son of Monster Magnet" was not finished. The track as it appears on the album was only a backing track for a much more complex piece, but MGM refused to allow the additional recording time needed for completion. Much to Zappa's chagrin, it was issued in its unfinished state.<ref>"How We Made It Sound That Way", interview on WDET Detroit, November 13, 1967 (excerpt included as part of the [[The MOFO Project/Object|MOFO]] album, 2006)</ref>

During the recording of ''Freak Out!'', Zappa moved into a house in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] with friend Pamela Zarubica, who appeared on the album.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|112}} The house became a meeting (and living) place for many LA musicians and [[groupie]]s of the time, despite Zappa's disapproval of their illicit drug use.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|122}} After a short promotional tour following the release of ''Freak Out!'', Zappa met [[Gail Zappa|Adelaide Gail Sloatman]]. He fell in love within "a couple of minutes", and she moved into the house over the summer.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|65–66}} They married in 1967, had four children and remained together until Zappa's death.

Wilson nominally produced the Mothers' second album ''[[Absolutely Free]]'' (1967), which was recorded in November 1966, and later [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in New York, although by this time Zappa was in ''de facto'' control of most facets of the production. It featured extended playing by the Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined Zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt rhythm changes into songs that were built from diverse elements.<ref name="lowe"/>{{rp|5}} Examples are "Plastic People" and "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", which contained lyrics that lampooned the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, but also of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].<ref name="lowe"/>{{rp|38–43}} As Zappa put it, "[W]e're satirists, and we are out to satirize everything."<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|135–138}} At this time, Zappa had also recorded material for an album of orchestral works to be released under his own name, ''[[Lumpy Gravy (1967 album)|Lumpy Gravy]],'' to be released by [[Capitol Records]] in 1967. Due to contractual problems, the album was held back. Zappa took the opportunity to radically restructure the material, adding newly recorded improvised dialogue.

===New York period (1966–1968)===
{{see also|We're Only in It for the Money|Cruising with Ruben & the Jets|Uncle Meat|Ahead of Their Time}}
The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the [[Garrick Cinema|Garrick Theater]] (at 152 [[Bleecker Street]], above the [[Cafe au Go Go]]) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year.<ref name="james">{{cite book |last=James |first=Billy |date=2000 |title=Necessity Is ...: The Early Years of Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention |publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd |location=London |isbn=978-0946719518}}</ref>{{rp|62–69}} As a result, Zappa and his wife Gail, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|140–141}} Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|147}} Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a "[[gook]] baby".<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|94}}

In 1967, filmmaker [[Ed Seeman]] paid Zappa $2,000 to produce music for a [[Luden's]] cough drops television commercial.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsbDne3sZRQ | title=Luden's Cough Drops Commercial | website=[[YouTube]] | date=April 24, 2017 }}</ref> Zappa's music was matched with Seeman's animation and the advertisement won a [[Clio Awards|Clio Award]] for "Best Use of Sound".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.zeroto180.org/frank-zappas-clio-award/ | title=Frank Zappa's Clio Award | date=June 30, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAUvFst5bOI | title=Zappa's Luden's Cough Drops | website=[[YouTube]] | date=February 27, 2008 }}</ref> An alternate version of the soundtrack, called "The Big Squeeze", later appeared on Zappa's posthumous 1996 album ''[[The Lost Episodes]]''. This version lacks Seeman's narration.

While living in New York City, and interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'' (released 1968).<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r22631|pure_url=yes}}|title=We're Only in It for the Money. Review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|access-date=January 2, 2008}}</ref> It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. ''We're Only in It for the Money'' featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the [[hippie]] and [[flower power]] phenomena.<ref name="walley80"/>{{rp|90}}<ref name="watson05"/>{{rp|15}} He sampled surf music from his Studio Z days in the audio collage ''Nasal Retentive Caliope Music''.

[[File:The Mothers of Invention (1968).jpg|thumb|left|Zappa (back) with the Mothers, 1968]]
Reflecting Zappa's eclectic approach to music, the next album, ''[[Cruising with Ruben & the Jets]]'' (1968), was very different. It represented a collection of [[doo-wop]] songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute.<ref name="lowe"/>{{rp|58}} Zappa later remarked that the album was conceived like Stravinsky's compositions in his neo-classical period: "If he could take the forms and clichés of the classical era and pervert them, why not do the same&nbsp;... to doo-wop in the fifties?"<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|88}} The opening theme from Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' is sung in "Fountain of Love".

In 1967 and 1968, Zappa made two appearances with [[the Monkees]]. The first appearance was on an episode of [[The Monkees (TV series)|their TV series]], "The Monkees Blow Their Minds", where Zappa, dressed up as [[Michael Nesmith|Mike Nesmith]], interviews Nesmith who is dressed up as Zappa. After the interview, Zappa destroys a car with a sledgehammer as the song "Mother People" plays. He later provided a cameo in the Monkees' movie [[Head (film)|''Head'']] where, leading a cow, he tells [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] "the youth of America depends on you to show them the way." Zappa respected the Monkees and attempted to recruit [[Micky Dolenz]] to the Mothers but RCA/Columbia/Colgems would not release Dolenz from his contract.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|158–159}}

During the late 1960s, Zappa continued to develop the business side of his career. He and Herb Cohen formed the [[Bizarre Records|Bizarre]] and [[Straight Records|Straight]] labels to increase creative control and produce recordings by other artists. These labels were distributed in the US by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Zappa/Mothers recordings appeared on Bizarre along with [[Wild Man Fischer]] and [[Lenny Bruce]].<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|173–175}} Straight released the double album ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' for [[Captain Beefheart]], and releases by [[Alice Cooper]], [[The Persuasions]], and [[the GTOs]]. The Mothers' first album on Bizarre was 1969's ''[[Uncle Meat]]'', which Zappa described as "most of the music from the Mothers' movie of the same name which we haven't got enough money to finish yet". A version of the ''[[Uncle Meat (film)|Uncle Meat]]'' film was released direct-to-video in 1987. Principal photography having never been completed, the VHS videocassette is a "making of" documentary showing rehearsals and background footage from 1968 and interviews with people involved with the uncompleted production.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/uncle-meat-full-film | title=Uncle Meat Full Film 1987 | date=December 8, 1987 }}</ref>

In 1970, Zappa met conductor [[Zubin Mehta]]. They arranged a May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, the music was mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie ''[[200 Motels]]''.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|109}} Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|88}} His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt that the quality of performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|142–156}}

Later in 1970, Zappa formed a new version of the Mothers (from then on, he mostly dropped the "of Invention"). Along with Ian Underwood, the new band also included British drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]], jazz keyboardist [[George Duke]], bassist [[Jeff Simmons (musician)|Jeff Simmons]], and the two lead singers of [[the Turtles]], [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]], who, due to persistent legal and contractual problems, adopted the stage name "The Phlorescent Leech and Eddie" or "[[Flo & Eddie]]" for short.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|201}} Another member of the Turtles, [[Jim Pons]], would join on bass in February 1971, following Simmons' departure the previous month and his brief replacement by Martin Lickert.

This version of the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album ''[[Chunga's Revenge]]'' (1970),<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|205}} which was followed by [[200 Motels (album)|the double-album soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[200 Motels]]'' (1971), featuring the Mothers, the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Theodore Bikel]], and [[Keith Moon]].

After ''200 Motels'', the band went on tour, which resulted in two live albums, ''[[Fillmore East – June 1971]]'' and ''[[Just Another Band from L.A.]]''; the latter included the 20-minute track "[[Billy the Mountain]]", Zappa's satire on rock opera set in Southern California.

===Accident, attack, and aftermath===
[[File:Frank Zappa Mothers of Invention 1971.JPG|right|thumb|Zappa with the Mothers, 1971]]

On December 4, 1971, Zappa suffered his first of two serious setbacks. While performing at [[Montreux Casino|Casino de Montreux]] in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|112–115}} [[Deep Purple]] were booked to record in the casino after Zappa's performance, and wrote about the incident in their 1972 song "[[Smoke on the Water]]". A recording of the incident and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album ''Swiss Cheese/Fire'', released legally as part of Zappa's ''[[Beat the Boots II]]'' box set. After losing $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1971|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) worth of equipment and a week's break, the Mothers played at the [[Rainbow Theatre]], London, with rented gear. During the encore, an audience member, jealous because of his girlfriend's infatuation with Zappa, pushed him off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit.<ref name="Reed">{{cite web |last1=Reed |first1=Ryan |title=When Frank Zappa Was Pushed Offstage in London |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/41-years-ago-frank-zappa-pushed-off-stage-in-london/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=January 29, 2019 |date=December 10, 2015}}</ref> The band thought Zappa had been killed—he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed [[larynx]], which ultimately caused his voice to drop a [[Major third|third]] after healing.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|112–115}} A recording of the whole concert, including the attack, was released on the posthumous album ''[[The Mothers 1971]]'' in 2022.

After the attack, Zappa needed to use a wheelchair for an extended period; this made touring impossible for over half a year. Upon return to the stage in September 1972, Zappa was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed "shorter than the other" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs "Zomby Woof" and "[[Dancin' Fool]]"), resulting in chronic back pain.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|112–115}} Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.

In 1972, Zappa released two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, ''[[Waka/Jawaka]]'' and ''[[The Grand Wazoo]]'', which were recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni.<ref name="lowe"/>{{rp|101}} Musically, the albums were akin to ''Hot Rats,'' in that they featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|225–226}} Zappa began touring again in late 1972.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|225–226}} His first effort was a series of concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece [[big band]] referred to as the Grand Wazoo. This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five weeks from October to December 1972.<ref>Official recordings of these bands did not emerge until more than 30&nbsp;years later on ''[[Wazoo (album)|Wazoo]]'' (2007) and ''[[Imaginary Diseases]]'' (2006), respectively.</ref>

Zappa then formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included [[Ian Underwood]] (reeds, keyboards), [[Ruth Underwood]] (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] (sax, flute and vocals), [[Bruce Fowler]] (trombone), [[Tom Fowler (musician)|Tom Fowler]] (bass), [[Chester Thompson]] (drums), Ralph Humphrey (drums), [[George Duke]] (keyboards, vocals), and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] (violin).

Following the split with Warner, Zappa reconfigured the four disputed albums, along with some other material, into a quadruple album called ''[[Läther]]'' (pronounced "leather") and negotiated distribution with [[Phonogram Inc.]] for release on the new [[Zappa Records]] label. ''Läther'' was scheduled for release on [[Halloween]] 1977, but legal action from Warner forced Zappa to shelve this project.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|261}}

Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner contracts,<ref name="watson05"/>{{rp|49}} the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–1977 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|261}} Drummer [[Terry Bozzio]] became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and original Mothers of Invention bassist [[Roy Estrada]] joined. Among other musicians were bassist [[Patrick O'Hearn]], singer-guitarist [[Ray White]] and former [[Roxy Music]] keyboardist/violinist [[Eddie Jobson]]. In December 1976, Zappa appeared as a featured musical guest on the [[NBC]] television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|262}} Zappa's song "[[I'm the Slime]]" was performed with a voice-over by ''SNL'' booth announcer [[Don Pardo]], who also introduced "Peaches En Regalia" on the same airing. In 1978, Zappa served both as host and musical act on the show, and as an actor in various sketches. The performances included an impromptu musical collaboration with cast member [[John Belushi]] during the instrumental piece "The Purple Lagoon". Belushi appeared as his [[Saturday Night Live Samurai|Samurai Futaba]] character playing the tenor sax with Zappa conducting.<ref>Zappa, Frank, 1978, ''Zappa in New York'', Liner Notes.</ref> However, he earned a ban from the show after the latter episode because he had done what producers called "a disastrous job of hosting" (Zappa reportedly did not get along with cast and crew in the lead-up to recording, then told the audience he was simply reading from cue cards).<ref name="banned">{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Anna|title=Why Frank Zappa was Banned from SNL|date=April 14, 2022|work=Grunge |url=https://www.grunge.com/832481/why-frank-zappa-was-banned-from-snl/}}</ref>

After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released ''[[Tinsel Town Rebellion]]'' in 1981. It was the first release on his own [[Barking Pumpkin Records]],<ref name="lowe"/>{{rp|161}} and featured live recordings from 1979 and 1980, as well as a new studio track, "Fine Girl". The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of ''[[sprechstimme]]'' (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer Vinnie Colaiuta).<ref name="lowe"/>{{rp|161}} While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist,<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|284}} the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and "The Blue Light" have been described as a "hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything".<ref name="lowe"/>{{rp|165}} The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist [[Steve Vai]], who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|283}}

In 1981, Zappa also released three instrumental albums, ''[[Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar]]'', ''Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More'', and ''The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar'', which were initially sold via mail order, but later released as one 3-LP set through CBS Records (now [[Sony Music Entertainment]]) due to popular demand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zappa|first=Frank|title=Absolutely Frank.

In May 1982, Zappa released ''[[Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch]]'', which featured his biggest selling single ever, the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated song "[[Valley Girl (song)|Valley Girl]]" (topping out at No.&nbsp;32 on the ''Billboard'' charts).<ref name="BBsingles"/> In her improvised lyrics to the song, Zappa's daughter [[Moon Zappa|Moon]] satirized the [[patois]] of teenage girls from the [[San Fernando Valley]], which popularized many "[[Valleyspeak]]" expressions such as "gag me with a spoon", "fer sure, fer sure", "grody to the max", and "barf out".<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t2677879|pure_url=yes}}|title="Valley Girl" --song review|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=AllMusic|access-date=January 7, 2008}}</ref>

A 1983 album ''[[The Man from Utopia]],'' featured an anti-drug single "[[Cocaine Decisions]]". "The Dangerous Kitchen" and "The Jazz Discharge Party Hats" are continuations of the sprechstimme vocal excursions on ''Tinseltown Rebellion'', and the album also has jazzy rock instrumentals "Mōggio" and "We Are Not Alone". A second 1983 album, ''[[London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. I]]'', includes orchestral Zappa compositions conducted by [[Kent Nagano]] and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO). A second record of these sessions, ''[[London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. II]]'' was released in 1987. The material was recorded under a tight schedule with Zappa providing all funding, helped by the commercial success of "Valley Girl".<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|146–156}} Zappa was not satisfied with the LSO recordings. One reason is "Strictly Genteel", which was recorded after the trumpet section had been out for drinks on a break: the track took 40 edits to hide out-of-tune notes.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|146–156}}

Conductor Nagano, who was pleased with the experience, noted that "in fairness to the orchestra, the music is humanly very, very difficult".<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|315}} Some reviews noted that the recordings were the best representation of Zappa's orchestral work so far.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r53172|pure_url=yes}}|title=London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. 1.

===Beginning of Synclavier works===

In 1983, Zappa began using the [[Synclavier]], an early digital synthesizer which over time became his primary compositional and performance tool.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|172–173}} According to Zappa, "With the Synclavier, any group of imaginary instruments can be invited to play the most difficult passages&nbsp;... with ''one-millisecond'' accuracy—every time".<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|172–173}} Even though it essentially did away with the need for musicians,<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|319}} Zappa viewed the Synclavier and real-life musicians as separate.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|172–173}}

In late 1984, he released four albums. ''[[The Perfect Stranger (Frank Zappa album)|The Perfect Stranger]]'' contains orchestral works commissioned and conducted by celebrated conductor, composer and pianist [[Pierre Boulez]] (who was listed as an influence on ''Freak Out!''), and performed by his [[Ensemble intercontemporain]]. These were juxtaposed with premiere Synclavier pieces. Again, Zappa was not satisfied with the performances of his orchestral works, regarding them as under-rehearsed, but in the album liner notes he respectfully thanks Boulez's demands for precision.<ref name="watson05"/>{{rp|73}} The Synclavier pieces stood in contrast to the orchestral works, as the sounds were electronically generated and not, as became possible shortly thereafter, [[Sampling (music)|sampled]].

''[[Them or Us]]'' is a two LP set of studio and live rock recordings. It includes a version of the [[Allman Brothers Band]] song "[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]", and "Be in My Video", Zappa's satirical take on perceived visual clichés of the [[MTV]] channel. ''[[Francesco Zappa (album)|Francesco Zappa]]'', a Synclavier rendition of works by 18th-century composer [[Francesco Zappa]], was also released in 1984.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Rock |edition=illustrated |publisher=Rough Guides |date=2003 |isbn=978-1-85828-457-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/2244 2244] |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/2244 |url-access=registration}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fie47qSuTsoC&pg=PA2244 Extract of page 2244]</ref>

The album ''[[Thing-Fish]]'' was an ambitious three-record set in the style of a Broadway play dealing with a [[dystopia]]n "what-if" scenario involving feminism, homosexuality, manufacturing and distribution of the AIDS virus, and a [[eugenics]] program conducted by the United States government.<ref>The musical was eventually produced for the stage in 2003.

=== Merchandising ===
Zappa's mail-order merchandise business, Barfko-Swill, established during the 1980s by Zappa's wife Gail, offers t-shirts, videos, posters, sheet music, and collector's recordings, most of them unavailable through other media.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 4, 2021 |title=Barfko-Swill |url=https://wiki.killuglyradio.com/wiki/Barfko-Swill |access-date=May 2, 2023 |website=Zappa wiki jawaka}}</ref> Gail has explained why Barfko-Swill was founded: "Just piles and piles of fan mail sitting around unanswered or with no response. The first thing that we did was put a list together from the fan mail and made a Barking Pumpkin t-shirt available which we still have – same old shirt, same old logo, same old price – just to see what would happen. Everybody would write to us and ask us if there was something they could get besides records. ... That was really the primary reason for getting into the business – for setting up Barfko-Swill – in those days was to be independent. To not have to rely on a major record company's interest and ability to promote your product. And that was what the challenge was for me. I prefer the autonomy."<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Wheeler |first=Drew |date=May 1990 |title=Just Plain Folks |url=https://www.afka.net/Articles/1990-05_Billboard_2.htm |magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

The album ''[[Jazz from Hell]],'' released in 1986, earned Zappa his first [[Grammy Award]] in 1988 for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]]. Except for one live guitar solo ("St. Etienne"), the album exclusively featured compositions brought to life by the Synclavier.

Zappa's last tour in a rock and jazz band format took place in 1988 with a 12-piece group which had a repertoire of over 100 (mostly Zappa) compositions, but which split under acrimonious circumstances before the tour was completed.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|346–350}} The tour was documented on the albums ''[[Broadway the Hard Way]]'' (new material featuring songs with strong political emphasis); ''[[The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life]]'' (Zappa "standards" and an eclectic collection of cover tunes, ranging from [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]'' to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]"); and ''[[Make a Jazz Noise Here]]'' (Zappa's more instrumentally complex and jazz orientated material). An album of guitar solos from this tour also appeared as the posthumous 2006 album ''[[Trance-Fusion]]'', a follow-up to the ''Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar'' and ''Guitar'' albums.

More recordings from the 1988 tour would appear as part of ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore (disambiguation)|You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore]]'', a series of six double CDs compiled by Zappa from unreleased live recordings, dating back to the earliest Mothers recordings from 1965. The six volumes were released between 1988 and 1992.

''[[The Real Frank Zappa Book]]'', co-written with Peter Occhiogrosso, was published by [[Poseidon Press]] in 1989. Zappa appeared on the TV interview show ''[[Larry King Live]]'' to promote it. He explained the title by saying he wrote it in response to previous unauthorized books, which he considered to be stupid and exploitative.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIO57D3ruQU | title=Frank Zappa plugs his autobiography on Larry King Live | website=[[YouTube]] | date=May 22, 2012 }}</ref>

[[John Kricfalusi]], creator of [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'', idolized Zappa and got him to voice the [[Pope]] in the episode "[[Powdered Toast Man (episode)|Powdered Toast Man]]"; as Zappa was too ill to head to [[Spümcø]] at [[Los Angeles]], he recorded his lines at his residence. The episode aired in August 1992 to significant controversy without relation to Zappa's appearance.{{sfn|Komorowski|2017|p=145}}

In September 1992, the concerts went ahead as scheduled but Zappa could only appear at two in Frankfurt due to illness. At the first concert, he conducted the opening "Overture" and the final "[[G-Spot Tornado]]", as well as the theatrical "Food Gathering in Post-Industrial America, 1992" and "Welcome to the United States" (the remainder of the program was conducted by the ensemble's regular conductor [[Peter Rundel]]). Zappa received a 20-minute ovation.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|371}} "G-Spot Tornado" was performed with Canadian dancer [[Louise Lecavalier]].

===Influences===
Zappa grew up influenced by [[avant-garde]] composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern; 1950s [[blues]] artists [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]], [[Guitar Slim]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]], and [[B.B. King]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afka.net/Articles/1987-01_Guitar_Player.htm|title=Frank Zappa On&nbsp;...

His own heterogeneous ethnic background, and the diverse social and cultural mix in and around greater Los Angeles, were crucial in the formation of Zappa as a practitioner of [[underground music]] and of his later distrustful and openly critical attitude towards "mainstream" social, political and musical movements. He frequently lampooned musical fads like [[psychedelia]], [[rock opera]] and [[disco]].<ref name="watson96"/>{{rp|13}}{{refn|group="nb"|Among his many musical satires are the 1967 songs "Flower Punk" (which parodies the song "[[Hey Joe]]") and "[[Who Needs the Peace Corps?]]", which are critiques of the late-Sixties commercialization of the [[hippie]] phenomenon.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Producer as Composer: Shaping the Sounds of Popular Music|edition=illustrated|first1=Virgil|last1=Moorefield |publisher=MIT Press|date=2010|isbn=978-0-262-51405-7|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZ0R4_Oxr-4C}}</ref>}} Television also exerted a strong influence, as demonstrated by quotations from show themes and advertising jingles found in his later works.<ref name="quotes"/>

In his book ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', Zappa credited composer [[Spike Jones]] for his frequent use of funny sound effects, mouth noises, and humorous percussion interjections. After explaining his ideas on this, he said "I owe this part of my musical existence to Spike Jones."<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Zappa |first1=Frank |last2=Occhiogrosso |first2=Peter |year=1988 |title=The Real Frank Zappa Book |url=http://pierroule.com/ZappaRealBook/TheRFZBook.htm#8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408185245/http://pierroule.com/ZappaRealBook/TheRFZBook.htm#8 |archive-date=April 8, 2022 |url-status=usurped |access-date=December 4, 2021 |via=pierroule.com |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=0-671-63870-X}}</ref>

===Techniques===
====Guitar playing====
Zappa is widely recognized as one of the most significant electric guitar soloists. In a 1983 issue of ''[[Guitar World]]'', John Swenson declared: "the fact of the matter is that [Zappa] is one of the greatest guitarists we have and is sorely unappreciated as such."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/gw-archive/frank-zappa-talks-gear-praises-steve-vai-his-first-guitar-world-interview-1982 |title=Frank Zappa Talks Gear, Praises Steve Vai in His First Guitar World Interview from 1982 |magazine=Guitar World |date=April 22, 2011 |access-date=December 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115230030/http://www.guitarworld.com/frank-zappa-talks-gear-praises-steve-vai-his-first-guitar-world-interview-1982 |archive-date=November 15, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> His idiosyncratic style developed gradually and was mature by the early 1980s, by which time his live performances featured lengthy improvised solos during many songs. A November 2016 feature by the editors of ''Guitar Player'' magazine wrote: "Brimming with sophisticated motifs and convoluted rhythms, Zappa's extended excursions are more akin to symphonies than they are to guitar solos." The symphonic comparison stems from his habit of introducing melodic themes that, like a symphony's main melodies, were repeated with variations throughout his solos. He was further described as using a wide variety of scales and modes, enlivened by "unusual rhythmic combinations". His left hand was capable of smooth [[legato]] technique, while Zappa's right was "one of the fastest pick hands in the business."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/artist-lessons/1026/frank-zappa-shut-up-n-learn-his-guitar-techniques--tab--audio/56754 |title=Frank Zappa: Shut Up 'N Learn His Guitar Techniques &#124; TAB + AUDIO |publisher=GuitarPlayer |date=November 23, 2016 |access-date=December 10, 2016}}</ref> In 2016, [[Dweezil Zappa]] explained a distinctive element of his father's guitar improvisation technique was relying heavily on upstrokes much more than many other guitarists, who are more likely to use downstrokes with their picking.<ref name="dweezilimprov" />

His song "Outside Now" from ''[[Joe's Garage]]'' poked fun at the negative reception of Zappa's guitar technique by those more commercially minded, as the song's narrator lives in a world where music is outlawed and he imagines "imaginary guitar notes that would irritate/An executive kind of guy", lyrics that are followed by one of Zappa's characteristically quirky solos in 11/8 time.<ref>{{cite web|author=François Couture |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/outside-now-mt0006332790 |title="Outside Now" – Frank Zappa &#124; Song Info |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=December 10, 2016}}</ref> Zappa transcriptionist Kasper Sloots wrote, "Zappa's guitar solos aren't meant to show off technically (Zappa hasn't claimed to be a big virtuoso on the instrument), but for the pleasure it gives trying to build a composition right in front of an audience without knowing what the outcome will be."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zappa-analysis.com/shuttxt.htm |title=Shut up 'n play yer guitar |website=Zappa-analysis.com |access-date=December 10, 2016}}</ref>

Zappa's guitar style was not without its critics. English guitarist and bandleader [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], whose band [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] toured with the Mothers of Invention in 1973, opined that Zappa was "very interesting as a human being and a very interesting composer" and that he "was a very good musician but he was a dictator in his band," and that he "was taking very long guitar solos [when performing live]—10–15 minute guitar solos and really he should have taken two or three minute guitar solos, because they were a little bit boring."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hit-channel.com/interview-john-mclaughlin-solo-mahavishnu-orchestra-miles-davis/151278 | title=Interview: John McLaughlin (solo, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Miles Davis) • Hit Channel| date=September 22, 2018}}</ref>

====Tape manipulation====
During recording sessions in New York in 1967, Zappa increasingly used [[audio engineer|tape editing]] as a compositional tool.<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|160}} A prime example is found on the double album ''[[Uncle Meat]]'' (1969),<ref name="james"/>{{rp|104}} where the track "King Kong" is edited from various studio and live performances. Zappa had begun regularly recording concerts,{{refn|group="nb"|In the process, he built up a vast archive of live recordings. In the late 1980s some of these recordings were collected for the 12-CD set ''You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore''.}} and because of his insistence on precise [[Out of tune|tuning]] and timing, he was able to augment his studio productions with excerpts from live shows, and vice versa.<ref name="Mix2003">{{cite web|title=We are The Mothers&nbsp;... and This Is What We Sound Like!|last=Michie|first=Chris|publisher=MixOnline.com|date=January 2003|url=http://mixonline.com/recording/business/audio_mothers_sound|access-date=January 4, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308055438/http://mixonline.com/recording/business/audio_mothers_sound/|archive-date=March 8, 2008}}</ref> Later, he combined recordings of different compositions into new pieces, irrespective of the [[tempo]] or [[Meter (music)|meter]] of the sources.

Zappa's parents were Francis Vincent Zappa and Rose Marie Zappa (née Colimore). Frank was the second of five children, preceded by his half-sister Ann and followed by his brothers Bobby and Carl and sister Patrice (also known as Candy).

Zappa was married to Kathryn J. "Kay" Sherman from 1960 to 1963. In 1967, he married [[Gail Zappa|Adelaide Gail Sloatman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/deathcert/zappa,%20frank_dc.pdf |title=Frank Zappa death certificate |website=Autopsyfiles.org |access-date=December 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Rock Stars Do The Dumbest Things|first1=Margaret|last1=Moser|first2=Bill|last2=Crawford|publisher=Macmillan|date=2007|isbn=978-1-4299-7838-5|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exdHqRsPWAUC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=exdHqRsPWAUC&pg=PT260 Extract of page 260]</ref> He and his second wife had four children: [[Moon Zappa|Moon]] (born 1967), [[Dweezil Zappa|Dweezil]] (born 1969), [[Ahmet Zappa|Ahmet]] (born 1974), and [[Diva Zappa|Diva]] (born 1979).<ref>{{cite book|title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story Of Frank Zappa|first1=Neil|last1=Slaven|publisher=Omnibus Press|date=2009|isbn=978-0-85712-043-4|page=529|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lNRIZm_baQC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4lNRIZm_baQC&pg=PT529 Extract of page 529]</ref> Moon and Ahmet sang on Frank's 1981 album ''[[You Are What You Is]]'', while Moon also provided the "[[Valley girl]]" voice on [[Valley Girl (song)|the song of the same name]] on 1982's ''[[Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch]]''.

Following Zappa's death, his widow Gail created the Zappa Family Trust, which owns the rights to Zappa's music and some other creative output: 62 albums released during Zappa's lifetime and 68 posthumously as of May 2025.

In the mid-1980s, Zappa learned of an obscure 18th century Italian composer and cellist named [[Francesco Zappa]]. Initially assuming him to be an ancestor, Frank recorded and released an album of Francesco's music, ''[[Francesco Zappa (album)|Francesco Zappa]]'', in 1984. It was subsequently found that Frank and Francesco were not actually related, which Frank confirmed in ''[[The Real Frank Zappa Book]]'' in 1989.

===Captain Beefheart===
{{main|Captain Beefheart}}
Zappa and [[Captain Beefheart|Don Van Vliet]] met when they were both teenagers and shared an interest in [[rhythm and blues]] and [[Chicago blues]].<ref name=Taylor>Steve Taylor{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPOsu8JOHO8C&q=Captain+Beefheart&pg=PA53 |title=A to X of Alternative Music|page=53 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=0826482171|access-date=January 26, 2010 }}</ref> They collaborated from this early stage with Zappa's scripts for "teenage operettas", such as "Captain Beefheart & the Grunt People", with Vliet eventually adopting the Captain Beefheart name. The earliest known recording of either Zappa or Beefheart is a collaboration between them, "Lost in a Whirlpool", recorded around 1958/1959 and included on the posthumous Zappa album ''[[The Lost Episodes]]'' in 1996. In 1963, the pair recorded a demo at the [[Pal Recording Studio]] in Cucamonga as the Soots, seeking support from a major label. Their efforts were unsuccessful, as Vliet's [[Howlin' Wolf]]-influenced vocal style and Zappa's distorted guitar were "not on the agenda" at the time.<ref name="Taylor"/> In 1965, while Zappa formed the Mothers of Invention, Beefheart assembled Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band. Their third album, 1969's critically acclaimed ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'', was produced by Zappa. That same year, Beefheart provided the vocal on "Willie the Pimp" on the ''[[Hot Rats]]'' album. Beefheart also played the harmonica on "San Ber'dino" (credited as "Bloodshot Rollin' Red") on ''[[One Size Fits All (Frank Zappa album)|One Size Fits All]]'' (1975) and "[[Find Her Finer]]" on ''[[Zoot Allures]]'' (1976).<ref>[http://www.beefheart.com/shop/zapbeef.htm "Frank Zappa featuring Captain Beefheart"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918125350/http://beefheart.com/shop/zapbeef.htm |date=September 18, 2010 }} The Captain Beefheart Radar Station. Retrieved July 1, 2010.</ref>

Over the years, Zappa and Beefheart's friendship was sometimes expressed in the form of rivalry, as musicians drifted back and forth between their groups. Beefheart joined Zappa's band on the early 1975 tour, documented on the ''[[Bongo Fury]]'' album,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Zappa-Beefheart-Mothers-Bongo-Fury/master/35842 |title=''Bongo Fury'' for Mothers link |work=Discogs.com |year=1975 |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref> mainly because conflicting contractual obligations made Beefheart unable to tour or record independently at the time. Their relationship grew acrimonious on the tour to the point that they refused to talk to one another. Zappa became irritated by Beefheart, who drew constantly, including while on stage, filling one of his large sketch books with rapidly executed portraits and warped caricatures of Zappa. Musically, Beefheart's primitive style contrasted sharply with Zappa's compositional discipline and abundant technique. Mothers of Invention drummer [[Jimmy Carl Black]] described the situation as "two geniuses" on "ego trips".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3zxyUy0VOY|title=The Artist Formally Known as Captain Beefheart|website=[[YouTube]] |date=June 5, 2021 }}</ref> Estranged for years afterwards, they reconciled by the end of Zappa's life.

==Beliefs and politics==

While he disapproved of drug use, he criticized the [[War on Drugs]], comparing it to [[alcohol prohibition]]; he stated that the [[United States Treasury]] would benefit from the decriminalization and regulation of drugs.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|329}} Describing his philosophical views, Zappa stated, "I believe that people have a right to decide their own destinies; people own themselves. I also believe that, in a democracy, government exists because (and only so long as) individual citizens give it a 'temporary license to exist'—in exchange for a promise that it will behave itself.

===Anti-censorship activism===

Kandy Stroud, a spokeswoman for the PMRC, announced that Senator Gore (who co-founded the committee) was a co-sponsor of that legislation. Zappa suggested that record labels were trying to get the bill passed quickly through committees, one of which was chaired by Senator [[Strom Thurmond]], who was also affiliated with the PMRC. Zappa further said that this committee was being used as a distraction from that bill being passed, which would lead only to the benefit of a select few in the music industry.<ref name="pmrc-statement">{{cite web |url=https://urbigenous.net/library/zappa.html |title=Frank Zappa: Statement To Congress, September 19, 1985 |date=September 19, 1985 |via=urbigenous.net |access-date=March 14, 2019}}</ref><ref name="cspan">{{cite AV media |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?69484-1/rock-lyrics-record-labeling |title=Rock Lyrics Record Labeling |date=September 19, 1985 |access-date=March 14, 2019 |work=[[C-SPAN]] |time=1:23:00}}</ref>

Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|267}} and called their proposal for voluntary [[Parental Advisory|labelling of records]] with explicit content "extortion" of the music industry.<ref name="Occhiogrosso"/>{{rp|262}}

In his prepared statement, he said:

<blockquote>The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design. It is my understanding that, in law, [[First Amendment]] issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative. In this context, the PMRC's demands are the equivalent of treating [[dandruff]] by [[decapitation]].&nbsp;... The establishment of a rating system, voluntary or otherwise, opens the door to an endless parade of moral quality control programs based on things certain Christians do not like.

==Legacy==
{{main|Frank Zappa in popular culture}}
Zappa was a controversial figure. As [[Geoffrey Himes]] noted in 1993 after the artist's death, Zappa was hailed as a genius by conductor [[Kent Nagano]] and nominated by Czechoslovakian President [[Václav Havel]] to the country's cultural ambassadorship; however, in his lifetime, Zappa was rejected twice for admission into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] dismissed Zappa's music as "sexist adolescent drivel ... with meters and voicings and key changes that are as hard to play as they are easy to forget."<ref name="wp"/> According to Himes:

{{blockquote|Admirers and detractors agree that Zappa's music—with its odd time signatures, unorthodox harmonies and fiendishly difficult lines—boasts a rare cerebral complexity. But that's where the agreement ends. Some fans find his sophomoric jokes ("Don't Eat the Yellow Snow") and pop music parodies ("Sheik Yerbouti") a crucial counterbalance to the rarefied density of the music; other devotees find the jokes an irrelevant sideshow to music best appreciated in a chamber or orchestral setting. The critics find the humor's smug iconoclasm a symptom of the essential emptiness of Zappa's intellectual exercises.<ref name="wp"/>}}

===Acclaim and honors===
{{Quote box|quote=Frank Zappa was one of the first to try tearing down the barriers between rock, jazz, and classical music. In the late Sixties his Mothers of Invention would slip from [[Stravinsky]]'s "[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petroushka]]" into [[The Dovells]]' "[[Bristol Stomp]]" before breaking down into saxophone squeals inspired by [[Albert Ayler]]|source= — ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'', p. 497|width=365px}}

''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004) writes: "Frank Zappa dabbled in virtually all kinds of music—and, whether guised as a satirical rocker, jazz-rock fusionist, guitar virtuoso, electronics wizard, or orchestral innovator, his eccentric genius was undeniable."<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Brackett|editor-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide: Completely Revised and Updated 4th Edition|date=2004|place=New York|publisher=Fireside|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/903 903]|isbn=978-0-7432-0169-8|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/903}}</ref> Even though his work drew inspiration from many different genres, Zappa was seen as establishing a coherent and personal expression. In 1980, biographer David Walley noted that "The whole structure of his music is unified, not neatly divided by dates or time sequences and it is all building into a composite".<ref name="walley80"/>{{rp|3}} On commenting on Zappa's music, politics and philosophy, [[Barry Miles]] noted in 2004 that they cannot be separated: "It was all one; all part of his 'conceptual continuity'."<ref name="miles"/>{{rp|383}}

Lescinsky discovered a [[animal|metazoan]] fossil, and named it ''Spygori zappania'' to honor "the late Frank Zappa&nbsp;... whose mission paralleled that of the earliest paleontologists: to challenge conventional and traditional beliefs when such beliefs lacked roots in logic and reason".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Spygoria zappania New Genus and Species, a Cloudina-like Biohermal Metazoan from the Lower Cambrian of Central Nevada|last1=Salak|first1=Marc|last2=Lescinsky|first2=Halard L.|journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]]|volume=73|issue=4|date=July 1999|pages=571–576|doi=10.1017/s002233600003239x|bibcode=1999JPal...73..571S |s2cid=132540126 }}</ref>

In 1994, lobbying efforts initiated by psychiatrist John Scialli led the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s [[Minor Planet Center]] to name an [[asteroid]] in Zappa's honor: [[3834 Zappafrank]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Seachrist|first=Lisa|title=Space Rock Gets Zappa'd|journal=Science|volume=265|issue=5174|date=August 12, 1994|page=871|doi=10.1126/science.265.5174.871-c |pmid=17782133|bibcode=1994Sci...265..871.}}</ref> The asteroid was discovered in 1980 by Czechoslovakian astronomer [[Ladislav Brožek]], and the citation for its naming says that "Zappa was an eclectic, self-trained artist and composer&nbsp;... Before 1989 he was regarded as a symbol of democracy and freedom by many people in Czechoslovakia".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/special/rocknroll/0003834.html|title=(3834) Zappafrank|publisher=IAU: Minor Planet Center ([[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]])|access-date=August 15, 2008}}</ref>
In 1995, a bust of Zappa by sculptor Konstantinas Bogdanas was installed in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]. The choice of Zappa was explained as "a symbol that would mark the end of communism, but at the same time express that it wasn't always doom and gloom."<ref name="Pompilio"/> A replica was offered to the city of Baltimore in 2008, and on September 19, 2010—the twenty-fifth anniversary of Zappa's testimony to the U.S. Senate—a ceremony dedicating the replica was held, and the bust was unveiled at a library in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/2010/09/16/zappa-comes-home/|title=Zappa comes home|last=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 16, 2010|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=September 19, 2010|archive-date=March 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306091117/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-09-16/entertainment/bs-ae-zappa-cover-0917-20100916_1_gail-zappa-southeast-anchor-library-lithuania|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/2010/09/16/zappa-looza-a-full-guide-to-the-weekends-events/|title=Zappa-looza: A full guide to the weekend's events|last=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 16, 2010|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=September 19, 2010|archive-date=January 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102145706/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-09-16/news/bs-ae-zappa-rail-0917-2-20100916_1_southeast-anchor-library-zappa-plays-zappa-zappa-related|url-status=live}}</ref>
