The band has experienced several lineup changes over the years, leaving Sixx as the only constant member; these included the introduction of lead vocalist [[John Corabi]] (who was Neil's replacement from 1992 to 1996) and drummers [[Randy Castillo]] and [[Samantha Maloney]], both of whom filled in for Lee following his departure from Mötley Crüe in 1999; he returned to the band in 2004. In October 2022, after 41 years of service, Mars announced his retirement from touring with the band, with [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]] (formerly of [[David Lee Roth]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] and [[Rob Zombie]]) replacing him.

Lee subsequently became friends with Sixx and went to his Hollywood home to listen to new material he was working on.

"I never played a show with Nikki Sixx. Tommy and I played together many times, but I was gone as soon as Nikki entered the picture.

The newly formed band did not yet have a name. Neil has said that he told his bandmates that he was "thinking about calling the band Christmas". The other members were not very receptive to that idea. Then, while trying to find a suitable name, Mars remembered an incident that occurred when he was playing with a band called White Horse, when one of the other band members called the group "a motley looking crew". He had remembered the phrase and later copied it down as "Mottley Cru". After slight modification of the spelling, "Mötley Crüe" was eventually selected as the band's name, with the stylistic decision suggested by Neil to add the two sets of [[metal umlaut]]s, supposedly inspired by the German beer [[Löwenbräu]], which the members were drinking at the time.<ref>{{cite web |title=38 Years Ago: Nikki Sixx Forms Motley Crue |url=https://loudwire.com/motley-crue-founded-anniversary/ |website=Loudwire.com |access-date=November 18, 2019 |archive-date=November 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111070449/https://loudwire.com/motley-crue-founded-anniversary/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Other than the periods of February 1992 to September 1996 and of March 1999 to September 2004, and until October 2022, the lineup of Neil, Sixx, Lee, and Mars remained the same.<ref>{{cite web |title=Motley Crue Lineup Changes: A Complete Guide |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-lineup-changes/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617132312/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-lineup-changes/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

The band soon met its first manager, Allan Coffman, the thirty-eight-year-old brother-in-law of a friend of Mars's driver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~cruekiss/81.htm |title=Chronological Crue |publisher=Members.ozemail.com.au |access-date=October 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019034117/http://members.ozemail.com.au/~cruekiss/81.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The band's first release was the single "Stick to Your Guns/Toast of the Town", which was released on its own record label, [[Leathür Records]], which had a pressing and distribution deal with Greenworld Distribution in [[Torrance, California]].

During the "Crüesing Through Canada Tour '82", there were several widely publicized incidents. First, the band was arrested and then released at [[Edmonton International Airport]] for wearing their spiked stage wardrobe (considered "dangerous weapons") through customs, and for Neil arriving with a small carry-on filled with porn magazines (considered "indecent material"); both were staged [[Public relations|PR]] stunts. Customs eventually had the confiscated items destroyed. Second, while playing Scandals Disco in [[Edmonton]], a spurious "bomb threat" against the band made the front page of the ''[[Edmonton Journal]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/info/library.html |title=Edmonton Journal Library |publisher=Canada.com |access-date=October 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301085948/http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/info/library.html |archive-date=March 1, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> on June 9, 1982; Lee and assistant band manager Greif were interviewed by police as a result. This too ended up being a staged PR stunt perpetrated by Greif. Lastly, Lee threw a television set from an upper story window of the Sheraton Caravan Hotel. Canadian rock magazine ''Music Express'' noted that the band was "banned for life" from the city.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Patch |first1=Nick |title=Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx describes being kicked out of Canada in the '80s |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/article/motley-crues-nikki-sixx-describes-being-kicked-out-of-canada-in-the-80s/ |website=CTV News |date=January 23, 2015 |access-date=3 January 2020 |archive-date=January 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103194246/https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/motley-crue-s-nikki-sixx-describes-being-kicked-out-of-canada-in-the-80s-1.2202166 |url-status=live}}</ref> Despite the tour ending prematurely in financial disaster, it was the basis for the band's first international press.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/greif.shtml |title=Eric Greif Interview |publisher=Sleaze Roxx |date=April 28, 2007 |access-date=October 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929001925/http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/greif.shtml |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1983, the band changed management from Coffman to Doug Thaler and [[Doc McGhee]]. McGhee is best known for managing [[Bon Jovi]] and later [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], starting with their [[Alive/Worldwide Tour|reunion tour]] in 1996. Greif subsequently sued all parties in a Los Angeles Superior Court action that dragged on for several years, and coincidentally later resurfaced as manager of Sixx's former band, London. Coffman himself was sued by several investors to whom he had sold "stock in the band", including [[Michigan]]-based Bill Larson. Coffman eventually declared bankruptcy, as he had mortgaged his home at least three times to cover band expenses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Views – Too Fast Perspective |url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~cruekiss/exclusive.htm |website=Chronological Crue |access-date=29 December 2019 |archive-date=September 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922035214/http://members.ozemail.com.au/~cruekiss/exclusive.htm |url-status=live}}</ref>

Mötley Crüe spent most of the next year on a world tour in support of ''Theatre of Pain''. In February 1986, while in [[London]], [[England]], Sixx suffered a near-fatal heroin overdose, and the person who sold him the drugs dumped his unconscious body in a [[dumpster]]. The incident inspired Sixx to write the song "Dancing on Glass" for their next album.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Greatest 80s Song Inspired By An Overdose And A Rock Star Left For Dead |url=https://culturacolectiva.com/music/nikki-sixx-motley-crue-dancing-on-glass |website=Culture Collectiva |date=September 15, 2017 |access-date=29 December 2019 |archive-date=February 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202225655/https://culturacolectiva.com/music/nikki-sixx-motley-crue-dancing-on-glass |url-status=live}}</ref>

While 1988 was the first year that Mötley Crüe did not tour, controversy again hit the band that year in the form of a lawsuit by Matthew Trippe.

The suit was regarding the loss of royalties from his time in Mötley Crüe and the case was not closed until 1993 when Trippe dropped his charges and disappeared from public view.<ref name="weebly1988">{{cite web |url=http://klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com/matthew-trippe---may-1988.html |title=Matthew Trippe – May 1988 – Klassic Kerrang Interviews |publisher=Klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com |date=December 10, 1993 |access-date=February 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108161123/http://klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com/matthew-trippe---may-1988.html |archive-date=January 8, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1989, McGhee was fired after the band alleged he had broken several promises that he made in relation to the [[Moscow Music Peace Festival]], including giving his other band, [[Bon Jovi]], advantages in terms of slot placement.

Mötley Crüe spent the fall of 1989 and most of 1990 on a massive world tour, the band's biggest to that point.

On October 1, 1991, the band's first compilation album, ''[[Decade of Decadence 81–91]]'', was released. It peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart.

===1992–2003: Years of turmoil===
{{main|Mötley Crüe (album)|Generation Swine|New Tattoo}}
Neil left the band in February 1992 following the release of ''Decade of Decadence'', during a period in which most other prominent [[glam metal]] bands of the 1980s were breaking up or otherwise seeing their popularity decline significantly amid the advent of [[grunge]] and [[Alternative rock|alternative]] music. It remains unclear whether Neil was fired or quit the band. Sixx has long maintained that Neil quit, while Neil insists that he was fired. "Any band has its little spats," Neil observed in 2000, "and this one basically just stemmed from a bunch of 'fuck yous' in a rehearsal studio. It went from 'I quit' to 'You're fired' ... It was handled idiotically. The management just let one of the biggest bands in the world break up."<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Dave |last=Ling |title=We are lüdicröus! |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |issue=12 |date=March 2000 |page=48}}</ref>

Although Mötley's [[Mötley Crüe (album)|self-titled]] March 1994 release made the ''Billboard'' top ten (No. 7), the album was a commercial failure. It also prompted negative reactions from many fans due to Neil's absence and its sound. Corabi suggested the band bring back Neil, believing the latter would always be seen as the voice of the band. This eventually resulted in his own firing in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=What John Corabi Learned From Being Fired by Motley Crue |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-corabi-fired-motley-crue/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=March 25, 2019 |access-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616175554/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-corabi-fired-motley-crue/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Corabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first record with Mötley Crüe.

After ''Rolling Stone'' magazine broke out the news in their November 26, 1996 issue, the band reunited with Neil in 1997,<ref>{{cite book |title=Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal |first=David |last=Konow |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |year=2009 |page=346 |isbn=9780307565600}}</ref> after their current manager, Allen Kovac, and Neil's manager, Bert Stein, set up a meeting between Neil, Lee, and Sixx. Agreeing to "leave their egos at the door", the band released ''[[Generation Swine]]''. Although it debuted at No.&nbsp;4, and in spite of a live performance at the American Music Awards, the album was a commercial failure, due in part to lack of support from their label.<ref>{{cite web |title=When Motley Crue Brought Back Vince Neil for 'Generation Swine' |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-generation-swine/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=July 5, 2017 |access-date=June 15, 2019 |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616175557/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-generation-swine/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1998, Mötley Crüe's contractual ties with Elektra had expired, putting the band in total control of their future, including the ownership of the master recordings of all of their albums. Announcing the end of their relationship with Elektra, the band became one of the few groups to own and control their publishing and music catalog. They are one of only a handful of artists to own the masters to their material and reportedly did so by being the biggest pain they could be until Elektra got fed up and handed over the rights in order to get the band off their label.<ref>{{cite web |title=5 Brilliant Business Lessons From Mötley Crüe (Seriously!) |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3031014/5-brilliant-business-lessons-from-moetley-cruee-seriously |website=Fast Company |date=May 28, 2014 |access-date=18 December 2019 |archive-date=December 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218155724/https://www.fastcompany.com/3031014/5-brilliant-business-lessons-from-moetley-cruee-seriously |url-status=live}}</ref> After leaving Elektra the band created their own label, [[Mötley Records]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Q&A: Motley Crue still calling its own shots |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/music-motley-dc-idUSN27297720080627 |website=Reuters |date=June 27, 2008 |access-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617131931/https://www.reuters.com/article/music-motley-dc-idUSN27297720080627 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1999, Lee quit to pursue a solo career, due to increasing tensions with Neil. "All we got was a call from his attorney saying he wasn't coming back," recalled the singer. "He wasn't into rock 'n' roll anymore. He even said that rock is dead ... It all happened during a void in Mötley.

A promoter in England, Mags Revell, began clamoring for a Mötley Crüe reunion, ostensibly presenting himself as the voice of anxious fans waiting for more from the band.<ref>{{cite news |title=Motley Crue reunite for 2005 tour |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4074665.stm |work=BBC News |date=December 7, 2004 |access-date=3 January 2020 |archive-date=January 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103191042/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4074665.stm |url-status=live}}</ref> After meeting with management several times, in September 2004, Sixx announced that he and Neil had returned to the studio and had begun recording new material. In December 2004, the four original members announced a reunion tour, staging an announcement event in which they arrived at the Hollywood Palladium in a hearse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Motley Crue to Reunite for 2005 Tour, Album |url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/motley-crue-to-reunite-for-2005-tour-album |website=Fox News |date=March 25, 2015 |access-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621120757/https://www.foxnews.com/story/motley-crue-to-reunite-for-2005-tour-album |url-status=live}}</ref> The tour began on February 14, 2005, in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web |title=MOTLEY CRUE To Kick Off Reunion Tour In San Juan, Puerto Rico |url=http://bravewords.com/news/motley-crue-to-kick-off-reunion-tour-in-san-juan-puerto-rico |website=Bravewords.com |date=December 12, 2004 |access-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621120801/http://bravewords.com/news/motley-crue-to-kick-off-reunion-tour-in-san-juan-puerto-rico |url-status=live}}</ref> The resulting compilation album, ''[[Red, White & Crüe]]'', was released in February 2005. It features the band members' favorite original songs plus three new tracks, "[[If I Die Tomorrow]]", "[[Sick Love Song]]" (co-written by Sixx and [[James Michael]]), and a cover of [[the Rolling Stones]]' "[[Street Fighting Man]]". A small controversy was caused when it was suggested that neither Lee nor Mars played on the new tracks (duties were supposedly handled by [[The Vandals|Vandals]] drummer [[Josh Freese]]){{Citation needed|date=February 2022}}. However, a [[VH1]] documentary of the band's reunion later showed that Lee did indeed play on some of the tracks. The Japanese release of ''Red, White & Crüe'' includes an extra new track titled "I'm a Liar (and That's the Truth)". ''Red, White & Crüe'' charted at No.&nbsp;6 and has since gone platinum.<ref>{{cite web |title=RIAA Gold and Platinum |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Motley%20Crue |website=Recording Industry Association of America |access-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924160142/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Motley%20Crue |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Feuds and criticisms==
{{overly detailed|section|date=August 2023}}

===Metallica===
Often clashing during the early 1980s, both bands were fighting for dominance in the [[Los Angeles]] metal scene during [[Metallica]]'s years prior to their relocation to the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. Both singer/guitarist [[James Hetfield]] and drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] expressed their hatred of the heavy metal scene in Los Angeles during the time and frequently attacked multiple up-and-coming local bands in multiple interviews, including Mötley Crüe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxrcfRrNwnw|title=Metallica on the '80s Metal Bands They Didn't Get Along With|website=[[YouTube]]|date=August 17, 2020 |access-date=April 14, 2023|archive-date=March 30, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230330040214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxrcfRrNwnw|url-status=live}}</ref> Allegedly before a show in 1982, Ulrich claimed he drunkenly screamed "Fuck Mötley Crüe!" at the band from outside the [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|Troubadour]] in Hollywood, in which Sixx chased Ulrich in retaliation. Former lead guitarist [[Dave Mustaine]] during a 1983 interview had also taken aim at the band by claiming the Crüe and glam metal were an abbreviation for "Gay LA Music".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUMSFkSFPHU|title=Dave Mustaine talks about glam rock/metal|website=[[YouTube]]|date=February 25, 2011 |access-date=April 12, 2023|archive-date=April 28, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230428020447/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUMSFkSFPHU|url-status=live}}</ref> Though despite their public disdain for glam metal, Metallica were impressed by the production and commercial success of ''Dr. Feelgood'' in 1989, later hiring the album's producer [[Bob Rock]] to produce their [[Metallica (album)|self-titled fifth album]] in 1991. Several years later, both Sixx and Ulrich would reignite the animosity after Ulrich accused Mötley Crüe of performing to a backing track at the [[American Music Awards of 1997|1997 American Music Awards]]. Sixx responded via an online forum and would also attack Metallica's then-recent album ''[[Load (album)|Load]]'' insulting multiple members of the band for their change in sound and visual image.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockcelebrities.net/how-the-feud-between-metallicas-lars-ulrich-and-motley-crues-nikki-sixx-started/|title=How The Feud Between Metallica's Lars Ulrich And Mötley Crüe's Nikki Sixx Started|date=July 3, 2021|access-date=April 12, 2023|archive-date=April 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412185409/https://rockcelebrities.net/how-the-feud-between-metallicas-lars-ulrich-and-motley-crues-nikki-sixx-started/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grunge.com/258187/the-truth-about-nicki-sixxs-feud-with-metallica/|title=The Truth About Nikki Sixx's Feud with Metallica|date=October 7, 2020|access-date=April 12, 2023|archive-date=April 16, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230416174314/https://www.grunge.com/258187/the-truth-about-nicki-sixxs-feud-with-metallica/|url-status=live}}</ref> During a 2003 interview, Sixx would strangely defend Metallica's then-latest album ''[[St. Anger]]'' by claiming "I have learned to have sympathy for the enemy".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/m-tley-cr-e-bassist-defends-metallica-i-have-learned-to-have-sympathy-for-the-enemy|title=Crue Bassist Defends Metallica|date=June 2, 2003|access-date=April 12, 2023|archive-date=April 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412185407/https://blabbermouth.net/news/m-tley-cr-e-bassist-defends-metallica-i-have-learned-to-have-sympathy-for-the-enemy|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2006, both Tommy Lee and former Metallica bassist [[Jason Newsted]] took part in a reality show entitled ''[[Rock Star: Supernova]]'' as they would both participate in creating a supergroup while the show's premise revolved around finding a frontman via contest. During a 2011 meet-and-greet in [[Mexico City]], Hetfield was approached by a fan attacking Mötley Crüe due to their public image and frequent appearances in tabloids. Hetfield refused to directly respond to the fan's comments towards Mötley Crüe but did find humor in his insults toward the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUsFrHvJX_0|title=James Hetfield Meets a Mötley Crüe Hater (Gets really Uncomfortable/Cringy)|website=[[YouTube]]|date=November 24, 2020 |access-date=April 14, 2023|archive-date=April 14, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414003354/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUsFrHvJX_0|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2015, Lee would reignite the feud when he posted a Tweet featuring a picture of Ulrich with the words "Straight Outta Tempo" superimposed over his face. Lee presumably used a meme maker intended to promote the 2015 [[N.W.A]] biopic&nbsp;''[[Straight Outta Compton (film)|Straight Outta Compton]]''. Following the post by Lee, Vince Neil had stated online that he was unaware of the feud with Metallica; however, during a later interview with an [[Oregon]] radio show, Neil was again asked about the band's current relationship with Metallica and hung up on the show's host.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.contactmusic.com/vince-neil/news/vince-neil-hangs-up-on-radio-host-over-motley-crue-metallica-feud-questions_4951062|title=Vince Neil Hangs Up On Radio Host Over Motley Crue/metallica Feud Questions|date=September 30, 2015|access-date=April 14, 2023|archive-date=April 14, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414001449/https://www.contactmusic.com/vince-neil/news/vince-neil-hangs-up-on-radio-host-over-motley-crue-metallica-feud-questions_4951062|url-status=live}}</ref> Things were alleged to have calmed down by 2017, when Hetfield appeared on Sixx's radio show 'Sixx Sense'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsYmjoHZZTc|title=Deeper With Metallica's James Hetfield (AUDIO)|website=[[YouTube]]|date=July 12, 2017 |access-date=April 14, 2023|archive-date=April 14, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414002522/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsYmjoHZZTc&gl=US&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref> During an interview in 2021, Sixx applauded Metallica's longevity and praised several of their releases during an interview.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockcelebrities.net/nikki-sixx-discusses-metallicas-success-by-recalling-a-stunning-james-hetfield-moment/|title=Nikki Sixx Discusses Metallica's Success By Recalling A Stunning James Hetfield Moment|date=October 11, 2021|access-date=April 12, 2023|archive-date=April 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412185409/https://rockcelebrities.net/nikki-sixx-discusses-metallicas-success-by-recalling-a-stunning-james-hetfield-moment/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Guns N' Roses===
Though [[Guns N' Roses]] were initially hired to open for Mötley Crüe during the summer of 1987, things grew hostile between both sides in 1988 after Vince Neil alleged that then-Guns N' Roses guitarist [[Izzy Stradlin]] had assaulted his then-wife Sharise at the famed Cathouse club, according to Neil and club owner [[Riki Rachtman]]. Things came to a breaking point at the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards]] following Mötley Crüe's presentation of the award for 'Best Metal Video' to Guns N' Roses; however, only bassist [[Duff McKagan]] and drummer [[Steven Adler]] appeared at the stage to accept it. Following their performance with [[Tom Petty]], Neil rushed the side of the stage and threw a punch at Stradlin before being restrained by security. Guns N' Roses frontman [[Axl Rose]] was enraged with the incident, threatening Neil after security had separated the two. During an interview in August 1990, Rose later challenged Neil to a fight during an interview with [[Kurt Loder]], claiming "Anytime he wants it, [[Atlantic City]], I don't care. We'll put money on it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thethings.com/what-happened-between-axl-rose-and-vince-neil/|title=What Happened Between Axl Rose And Vince Neil?|date=May 16, 2022|access-date=April 15, 2023|archive-date=April 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415182328/https://www.thethings.com/what-happened-between-axl-rose-and-vince-neil/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/bitter-feud-between-axl-rose-vince-neil/ |title=The Bitter Feud Between Axl Rose and Vince Neil |first1=Arun |last1=Starkey |date=2022-07-03 |access-date=2023-04-21 |archive-date=April 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412192622/https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/bitter-feud-between-axl-rose-vince-neil/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Neil responded in early 1991 by also challenging Rose to a fight: "Axl if you are watching this, I want to challenge you to a fight. I'm gonna give you time and I'm gonna give you the place. There's no backing out now buddy. It's time to put up or shut up.", later expressing his intent to possibly host the fight in an arena.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockcelebrities.net/the-truth-behind-why-motley-crues-vince-neil-challenged-axl-rose-to-a-fight/|title=The Truth Behind Why Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil Challenged Axl Rose To A Fight|date=May 2, 2021|access-date=April 15, 2023|archive-date=April 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415182328/https://rockcelebrities.net/the-truth-behind-why-motley-crues-vince-neil-challenged-axl-rose-to-a-fight/|url-status=live}}</ref> Reportedly, [[Eddie Van Halen]] and then-current [[Van Halen]] singer [[Sammy Hagar]] had offered money to possibly host the fight at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. However, for unknown reasons, neither Rose or Neil responded to the offer. Neil claims Stradlin had called him with an apology for the incident, but the 1991 Guns N' Roses track "Shotgun Blues" was allegedly a [[diss track]] aimed at Neil.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZvCqR0NPYE|title=Axl Rose vs Vince Neil Feud: Guns N Roses vs Motley Crue|website=[[YouTube]]|date=March 31, 2020 |access-date=April 15, 2023|archive-date=April 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415182327/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZvCqR0NPYE|url-status=live}}</ref> Tensions were reported to have died down shortly afterwards when both Tommy Lee and former Guns N' Roses guitarist [[Gilby Clarke]] participated with former Metallica bassist [[Jason Newsted]] in a reality show entitled ''Rockstar: Supernova'', as they would contribute musical parts in the show's contest to find a vocalist of the newly formed supergroup. Things remained cordial until 2009 when Neil had lobbed insults towards Rose in response to Guns N' Roses' most recent album, ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', calling the record a flop and criticizing Rose for his management of the band at the time. In 2014, ''Revolver'' magazine honored Rose by calling him "The World's Greatest Singer"; in response, Neil jokingly mocked the award on Twitter, but deleted his response shortly afterward.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockandrolltruestories.com/why-vince-neil-attacked-izzy-stradlin/|title=Why Motley Crue's Vince Neil Attacked Guns N' Roses' Izzy Stradlin|date=April 25, 2022|access-date=April 12, 2023|archive-date=April 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412192623/https://rockandrolltruestories.com/why-vince-neil-attacked-izzy-stradlin/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Godsmack===
The feud between [[alternative metal]] band [[Godsmack]] and Mötley Crüe stems from the two sides clashing after Godsmack was hired as one of several supporting acts for Mötley Crüe during the band's 2009 [[Crüe Fest 2]] tour. Godsmack frontman [[Sully Erna]] and drummer [[Shannon Larkin]] have claimed the feud originated from Mötley Crüe's treatment of the support bands on tour, particularly Godsmack's fans who allegedly often left venues early following their own performance. Larkin recalls in a 2011 interview with ''[[Loudwire]]'': "Mötley Crüe's security were real weird with our guests getting backstage, like our guests might want to look at Mötley Crüe. Our guests were there to see us and they didn't care a shit about Mötley Crüe. Mötley Crüe is a legendary band that we all respect. When I was 17, I had 'Shout at the Devil' but it just kind of fronted us a little that they would think that our guests would be star-struck over them. So, that's where the bad blood came from."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/godsmack-shannon-larkin-explains-sully-erna-nikki-sixx-feud/|title=Godsmack's Shannon Larkin explains Sully Erna-Nikki Sixx feud|website=[[Loudwire]]|date=September 9, 2011|access-date=April 12, 2023|archive-date=April 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412190939/https://loudwire.com/godsmack-shannon-larkin-explains-sully-erna-nikki-sixx-feud/|url-status=live}}</ref> Sully Erna allegedly penned the 2010 track "[[Cryin' Like a Bitch]]" about Sixx in regards to his behavior towards Godsmack during the tour, though Shannon Larkin claims the song was written about former [[San Diego Chargers]] quarterback [[Philip Rivers]]. Sixx continued in a war of insults with the band as he alleged that Godsmack had asked to appear on his radio show multiple times, due to initial allegations of it being written as a [[diss track]] aimed at Sixx.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rockcelebrities.net/the-godsmack-song-written-to-attack-motley-crues-nikki-sixx/ |title=The Godsmack Song Written to Attack Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx |website=rockcelebrities.net |first1=Elif |last1=Ozden |date=2021-12-26 |access-date=April 12, 2023 |archive-date=April 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412225757/https://rockcelebrities.net/the-godsmack-song-written-to-attack-motley-crues-nikki-sixx/ |url-status=live }}</ref> During a 2015 appearance on the "Jasta Show" (hosted by [[Hatebreed]] frontman [[Jamey Jasta]]), Erna would attack Sixx further by calling Sixx an "old, fat, washed-up has-been". Erna continued the tirade by even challenging Sixx to a fight, claiming: "I'll say it straight out: I've never met a bigger fucking dick in my life than Nikki Sixx. He's a douchebag.

The comedic glam metal band [[Steel Panther]] engaged in a feud with Mötley Crüe following a tour between the two bands and [[Def Leppard]] in 2011. Numerous members of Steel Panther claim they were heavily influenced by Mötley Crüe's music; however, touring with the band exhibited a hostile environment, particularly from Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee. In the years following the tour, guitarist [[Satchel (musician)|Satchel]] claimed Tommy Lee had been rather hostile towards multiple band members due to allegations that he and singer [[Michael Starr (singer)|Michael Starr]] had sex with Lee's girlfriend at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://metalheadzone.com/steel-panther-star-claims-that-he-had-sex-with-motley-crue-members-wife/ |title=Steel Panther Star claims he had sex with Tommy Lee's girlfriend |first1=Eren Merdan |last1=Gursoy |date=2020-01-13 |access-date=2023-04-21 |archive-date=April 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412224426/https://metalheadzone.com/steel-panther-star-claims-that-he-had-sex-with-motley-crue-members-wife/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Starr also commented on Mötley Crüe's other feud with Godsmack, claiming Sully Erna would severely beat Sixx in a fistfight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sofa-king-cool-magazine.com/steel-panther-singer-says-sully-erna-could-punch-the-shit-out-of-nikki-sixx/|title=Sully Erna could punch the shit out of Nikki Sixx|access-date=April 12, 2023|archive-date=April 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412225424/http://sofa-king-cool-magazine.com/steel-panther-singer-says-sully-erna-could-punch-the-shit-out-of-nikki-sixx/|url-status=live}}</ref> In a 2015 interview, Starr would claim the members of Mötley Crüe take themselves too seriously given the comedic nature of Steel Panther's music. Sixx would respond in 2016 claiming he prioritized taking his musical contributions much more seriously. During a 2018 interview, Satchel claimed "There are bands that hate our guts... We did a tour a few years ago with Def Leppard and Mötley Crüe". Things escalated in 2019 when drummer [[Stix Zadinia]] and Starr appeared in a video on the channel 'Little Punk People' where the two were asked which dead musicians they could revive; Starr jokingly claimed he wanted to bring back Vince Neil from the 1980s, enraging Sixx, who later attacked Starr on Twitter for his comment. Shortly following the response from Sixx, Steel Panther's band account replied with an interview Mötley Crüe gave from 1994 (whilst Neil was not a part of the band), in which Sixx and guitarist Mick Mars mocked and joked at Neil's weight following a jet ski accident.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://loudwire.com/motley-crue-nikki-sixx-backstabbers-steel-panther/ |title=Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx fires shot at 'Backstabbers' Steel Panther |first1=Graham |last1=Hartmann |website=[[Loudwire]] |date=2019-10-18 |access-date=2023-04-21 |archive-date=April 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412224424/https://loudwire.com/motley-crue-nikki-sixx-backstabbers-steel-panther/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Though Mötley Crüe would not respond to the post, multiple band members of Steel Panther have praised Mötley Crüe's music as influential in multiple interviews afterwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://metalinjection.net/news/feuds/steel-panther-frontman-if-i-could-bring-one-musician-back-from-the-dead-itd-be-motley-crues-vince-neil |title=Steel Panther frontman: 'If I could bring one musician back from the dead, it'd be Motley Crue's Vince Neil |first1=Robert |last1=Pasbani |date=2019-10-12 |access-date=2023-04-21 |archive-date=April 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412224424/https://metalinjection.net/news/feuds/steel-panther-frontman-if-i-could-bring-one-musician-back-from-the-dead-itd-be-motley-crues-vince-neil |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Former Mötley Crüe members===
==== Mick Mars ====
On October 27, 2022, co-founding guitarist [[Mick Mars]] publicly announced his retirement from touring with the band after 41 years due to complications with [[ankylosing spondylitis]], a degenerative form of inflammatory arthritis leaving him unable to perform on tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/motley-crue-mick-mars-lawsuit-ankylosing-spondylitis/ |title=Mötley Crüe guitarist Mick Mars sues band, claiming he was fired for "horrific" disease |first1=Aimee |last1=Picchi |date=2023-04-11 |access-date=2023-04-21 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |archive-date=April 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230413233712/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/motley-crue-mick-mars-lawsuit-ankylosing-spondylitis/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Shortly afterwards, the band announced longtime [[Rob Zombie]] guitarist [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]] would be his replacement during the ongoing tour. In an interview with ''[[Ultimate Guitar]]'' dated March 13, 2023, [[Carmine Appice]], a friend of Mars', claimed that Mars, in addition to his declining health, had lost enjoyment for touring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/carmine-appice-claims-mick-mars-wasnt-happy-on-motley-crues-the-stadium-tour|title=CARMINE APPICE Claims MICK MARS 'Wasn't Happy' On MÖTLEY CRÜE's 'The Stadium Tour'|date=March 14, 2023|access-date=April 15, 2023|archive-date=April 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415175414/https://blabbermouth.net/news/carmine-appice-claims-mick-mars-wasnt-happy-on-motley-crues-the-stadium-tour|url-status=live}}</ref> Enraged with the comments, Nikki Sixx responded on Twitter, attacking Appice, referring to him as "a washed up drummer."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://guitar.com/news/music-news/nikki-sixx-refutes-carmine-appice-mick-mars-claims/|title=Nikki Sixx tears into Carmine Appice over claims that Mick Mars 'wasn't happy' with Mötley Crüe|access-date=April 15, 2023|archive-date=April 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230415175414/https://guitar.com/news/music-news/nikki-sixx-refutes-carmine-appice-mick-mars-claims/|url-status=live}}</ref> Following Sixx's comments, Mars began to attack the band during an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' published April 6, 2023, claiming the band's severance payout was "laughable" as his royalties had allegedly been cut to 7.5% as a result of his retirement. Mars further claimed he was forced to retire as opposed to being fired by the band based on their own displeasure with his medical ailments.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/08/arts/music/mick-mars-motley-crue-lawsuit.html |title=Mötley Crüe Guitarist's Lawsuit Says He Was Kicked Out |work=The New York Times |date=April 8, 2023 |last1=Oxenden |first1=Mckenna |access-date=April 13, 2023 |archive-date=April 12, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412123923/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/08/arts/music/mick-mars-motley-crue-lawsuit.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

On April 7, 2023, Mars publicly filed a lawsuit against Mötley Crüe in the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] for unpaid royalties, claiming the band had severely cut his touring royalty agreement from 25% to 5% as a direct result of his retirement. The band's representative Sasha Frid had revealed claims that a 2008 legal agreement signed by all four band members had documented that no resigning participants would receive the same compensation attributable to live performances or merchandise sales if a particular member had chosen to quit the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/04/12/motley-crue-vs-mick-mars-what-know-contentious-dispute/11652494002/|title=Mötley Crüe sued by guitarist Mick Mars: What to know about the rock band's civil war|website=[[USA Today]]|access-date=April 13, 2023|archive-date=April 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230413233713/https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/04/12/motley-crue-vs-mick-mars-what-know-contentious-dispute/11652494002/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/mick-mars-on-motley-crue-lawsuit-i-carried-these-bastards-for-years-3427753|title=Mick Mars on Mötley Crüe lawsuit: "I carried these bastards for years"|website=[[NME]]|date=April 9, 2023|access-date=April 13, 2023|archive-date=April 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230413235215/https://www.nme.com/news/music/mick-mars-on-motley-crue-lawsuit-i-carried-these-bastards-for-years-3427753|url-status=live}}</ref> Mars' attorney Ed McPherson publicly attacked the band in a statement due to their failure to reveal updated financial documents in regards to Mars' payout agreement following his retirement in October. According to Mars' accounts in the lawsuit, the band had also forced him to sell off his remaining share in the band, labeling their behavior as "bullying". Nikki Sixx would make a public statement on Twitter expressing his disappointment with the lawsuit but offered his public support for Mars nonetheless. Following this statement Mars would further attack the band in a ''Variety'' article, taking aim at Lee and Neil for their previous legal incidents and alleged the band had been performing with a backing track throughout the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2023/music/news/motley-crue-lawsuit-mick-mars-explained-lawyer-manager-1235580026/|title=Unpacking Motley Crue's Mess: Manager Slams Mick Mars' 'Smear Campaign'; Guitarist's Lawyer Says He Is 'Tired of Being Bullied' (EXCLUSIVE)|date=April 12, 2023|access-date=April 13, 2023|archive-date=April 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230413233711/https://variety.com/2023/music/news/motley-crue-lawsuit-mick-mars-explained-lawyer-manager-1235580026/|url-status=live}}</ref>

During an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' on July 3, 2023, Mars elaborated further by claiming he has refused to speak with any members of the band ever again, stating his intention to pursue his full royalty percentage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/news/mick-mars-motley-crue-update|title=Mick Mars says he never wants to speak to Mötley Crüe again: "I think all of us would be okay with that"|date=July 6, 2023|access-date=July 10, 2023|archive-date=July 10, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230710190414/https://www.guitarworld.com/news/mick-mars-motley-crue-update|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/motley-crue-mick-mars-lawsuit-things-learned-1234778252/|title=Mick Mars Never Wants to Speak to Mötley Crüe Again — and 14 Other Things We Learned|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=July 3, 2023|access-date=July 10, 2023|archive-date=July 10, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230710190414/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/motley-crue-mick-mars-lawsuit-things-learned-1234778252/|url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|September 2023}}, the matter remained in litigation.

==== John Corabi ====
Following the firing of Vince Neil in 1992, Mötley Crüe hired John Corabi as their new lead singer prior to the recording of their 1994 self-titled album. Fan reactions were mixed due to the uncharted nature of the band's change in sound with Corabi, in addition to their new stylistic direction of the 1990s. As the band began writing for their upcoming seventh album, ''[[Generation Swine]]'', tensions over the album's creative direction began to surface between the band and Corabi. Corabi blamed much of the poor songwriting and production on Nikki Sixx's leadership, while Sixx blamed Corabi for being unable to write songs fluidly. The band had previously hired new manager Allen Kovac in 1994 prior to the release of the self-titled album; however, the mixed response to the record in addition to backlash towards Corabi from longtime fans proved to be strenuous on the band's public image, resulting in the band firing Corabi during the recording of ''Generation Swine''. The band were forced by management and fan responses to rehire Neil, however; tensions with Corabi remained high for multiple years following the split. Corabi would later sue the band in 1997 due to removal of his songwriting credits on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/john-corabi-explains-his-1997-lawsuit-against-motley-crue-im-not-anybodys-doormat|title=John Corabi Explains His 1997 Lawsuit Against MÖTLEY CRÜE: 'I'm Not Anybody's Doormat'|date=December 25, 2014 }}</ref> Despite the tensions, Corabi took part in a short-lived supergroup with Sixx entitled [[Brides of Destruction]] with [[L.A. Guns]] guitarist [[Tracii Guns]] in 2003. Corabi later outlined his tensions with Sixx would resurface during the project and would attack Sixx during multiple public interviews for his poor leadership and even insulted his playing abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockcelebrities.net/ex-motley-crue-singer-john-corabi-reflects-on-his-feud-with-nikki-sixx/|title=Ex-Mötley Crüe Singer John Corabi Reflects On His Feud With Nikki Sixx|date=March 2022|access-date=April 13, 2023|archive-date=April 14, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414001454/https://rockcelebrities.net/ex-motley-crue-singer-john-corabi-reflects-on-his-feud-with-nikki-sixx/|url-status=live}}</ref> Following guitarist Mick Mars' lawsuit against the band in 2023, Corabi expressed his support for Mars while criticizing the band's poor financial decisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2022/11/30/john-corabi-thinks-motley-crue-is-lying-about-mick-mars-retirement-statement/|title=John Corabi Thinks Mötley Crüe is Lying About Mick Mars Retirement Statement|date=November 30, 2022|access-date=April 13, 2023|archive-date=April 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230413235949/https://www.metalsucks.net/2022/11/30/john-corabi-thinks-motley-crue-is-lying-about-mick-mars-retirement-statement/|url-status=live}}</ref>
