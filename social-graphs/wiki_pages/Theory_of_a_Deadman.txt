===Early years and self-titled album (1999–2003)===
Theory of a Deadman was initially formed in 1999 by lead guitarist/vocalist Tyler Connolly and bassist Dean Back.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20021114theory_of_a_deadman_theory_of_a_deadman|title=Theory of a Deadman|date=November 13, 2002 |publisher=Musicworld|access-date=November 13, 2002}}</ref> They later  became the first act to sign with [[Nickelback]] frontman [[Chad Kroeger]]'s [[604 Records]] imprint in 2001 after Connolly convinced Kroeger's ex-girlfriend Jodi to send him a copy of their first demo recording. Shortly afterwards; Kroeger invited Connolly to a barbecue and discussed giving his band a record deal soon after. They released their eponymous debut album ''[[Theory of a Deadman (album)|Theory of a Deadman]]'' on September 17, 2002, co produced by Kroeger. The name of the band comes from a song from their first album, whose lyrics describe a man preparing to commit suicide.
