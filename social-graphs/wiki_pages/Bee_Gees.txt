The trio was especially successful in popular music in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and later as prominent performers in the [[disco]] music era in the mid-to-late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part [[Close and open harmony|tight harmonies]]: Robin's clear [[vibrato]] lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[falsetto]] became their signature sound during the mid-to-late 1970s and 1980s. The group wrote all their own original material, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists, and are regarded as one of the most important and influential acts in pop-music history.<ref>{{cite news |last=Meagher |first=John |title=Ten songs that tell the story of the Bee Gees |url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/ten-songs-that-tell-the-story-of-the-bee-gees-39970515.html |work=The Independent |date=16 January 2021}}</ref> They have been referred to in the media as [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The Disco Kings, Britain's First Family of Harmony, and The Kings of Dance Music]].<ref name="docu">{{cite news |url=https://janksreviews.com/bee-gees-documentary/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201123040356/https://janksreviews.com/bee-gees-documentary/ |url-status=usurped |archive-date=23 November 2020 |title=The Career of Disco Kings the Bee Gees is Explored in New Documentary |work=janksreviews.com |date=23 November 2020 |access-date=20 July 2021 |last1=Janks |first1=Nick }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhino.com/article/the-bee-gees |title=The Bee Gees &#124; Rhino |website=www.rhino.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://blog.siriusxm.com/boogie-to-the-sounds-of-the-disco-days-during-the-best-of-the-bee-gees-weekend/ |title=Boogie to the sounds of the disco days during the 'Best of the Bee Gees Weekend'|date=19 January 2021}}</ref>

Born on the [[Isle of Man]] to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy|Chorlton, Manchester]], England, until the late 1950s. There, in 1955, they formed the [[skiffle]]/[[rock and roll]] group [[The Rattlesnakes (1950s band)|the Rattlesnakes]]. The family then moved to [[Redcliffe, Queensland|Redcliffe]], in the [[City of Moreton Bay|Moreton Bay Region]], Queensland, Australia, and later to [[Cribb Island, Queensland|Cribb Island]]. <!-- Editors: Please leave this description about their origins as it is, and nothing in the infobox, and don't say they are "English", "Australian", "Manx", etc. to avoid edit warring - see archives--> After achieving their first chart successes in Australia as the Bee Gees, they returned to the UK in January 1967, when producer [[Robert Stigwood]] began promoting them to a worldwide audience. The Bee Gees' [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack]] (1977) was the turning point of their career, with both the film and soundtrack having a cultural impact throughout the world, enhancing the disco scene's mainstream appeal. They won five [[Grammy Awards]] for ''Saturday Night Fever'', including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].

===1955–1966: Music origins, Bee Gees formation and popularity in Australia===
[[File:Bee Gees Plaque - Union Mills IOM - kingsley - 21-APR-09.jpg|right|thumb|Bee Gees plaque at Maitland Terrace/Strang Road intersection in Union Mills, [[Isle of Man]]]]

Born on the [[Isle of Man]] in the late 1940s, the Gibb brothers moved to their father [[Hugh Gibb]]'s home town [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], Manchester, England, in 1955. They formed a [[skiffle]]/rock-and-roll group, [[The Rattlesnakes (1950s band)|the Rattlesnakes]], which consisted of Barry on guitar and vocals, Robin and Maurice on vocals, and friends Paul Frost on drums and Kenny Horrocks on [[washtub bass#tea chest bass|tea-chest bass]]. In December 1957, the boys began to sing in harmony. The story is told that they were going to [[Lip sync|lip-sync]] to a record in the local Gaumont cinema (as other children had done on previous weeks), but, as they were running to the theatre, the fragile shellac 78-RPM record broke. The brothers had to sing live but received such a positive response from the audience that they decided to pursue a singing career.<ref name="Storyabout-pt2">{{cite web|url= http://www.brothersgibb.org/history-part-2.html|title= The story about The Bee Gees/Part 2—1950–1960|last= Adriaensen|first= Marion|publisher= Brothers Gibb|access-date= 9 May 2011|archive-date= 3 January 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110103230622/http://brothersgibb.org/history-part-2.html|url-status= dead}}</ref> In May 1958, the Rattlesnakes disbanded when Frost and Horrocks left, so the Gibb brothers then formed Wee Johnny Hayes and the Blue Cats, with Barry as "Johnny Hayes".<ref name="were">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&q=the+rattlesnakes+tales+of+the+brothers&pg=PT66 |title= The Bee Gees – Tales of the Brothers Gibb |last= Hughes |first= Andrew |access-date= 29 January 2013|isbn= 9780857120045 |year= 2009|publisher= Omnibus Press }}</ref>

In August 1958, the Gibb family, including older sister Lesley and infant brother [[Andy Gibb|Andy]] (born in March 1958), emigrated to Australia and settled in [[Redcliffe, Queensland]], just north-east of [[Brisbane]]. The young brothers began performing to raise pocket money. [[Dirt track racing|Speedway]] promoter and driver Bill Goode, who had hired the brothers to entertain the crowd at the Redcliffe Speedway in 1960, introduced them to Brisbane radio-presenter jockey Bill Gates. The crowd at the speedway would throw money onto the track for the boys, who generally performed during the interval of meetings (usually on the back of a truck that drove around the track) and, in a deal with Goode, any money they collected from the crowd they were allowed to keep. Gates named the group the "BGs" (later changed to "Bee Gees") after his, Goode's and Barry Gibb's initials. The name was not specifically a reference to "Brothers Gibb", despite popular belief.<ref name="rocknames">{{Citation |last= Dolgins |first= Adam |title= Rock Names: From Abba to ZZ Top |edition= 3rd |page= 24 |publisher= Citadel |year= 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.beegees.com/1543-2/|title= Behind the Name: Bee Gees – Bee Gees|date= 21 August 2017|website= beegees.com|access-date= 30 April 2018|archive-date= 30 April 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180430181555/http://www.beegees.com/1543-2/|url-status= dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.visitmoretonbayregion.com.au/blog/posts/the-history-of-the-bee-gees-redcliffe|title= The Bee Gees Redcliffe – The Gibbs Brothers Timeline|website= Visitmoretonbayregion.com.au|access-date= 30 April 2018|archive-date= 30 April 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180430181715/https://www.visitmoretonbayregion.com.au/blog/posts/the-history-of-the-bee-gees-redcliffe|url-status= dead}}</ref>

During the next few years, they began working regularly at resorts on the Queensland coast. Through his songwriting, Barry sparked the interest of Australian star [[Col Joye]], who helped the brothers get a recording deal in 1963 with [[Festival Records]] subsidiary [[Leedon Records]] under the name "Bee Gees". The three released two or three singles a year, while Barry supplied additional songs to other Australian artists. In 1962 the Bee Gees were chosen as the supporting act for [[Chubby Checker]]'s concert at the Sydney Stadium.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.brothersgibb.org/history-part-3.html |title= History Part 3 – The Story of the Bee Gees: 1960–1965 |first= Marion | last = Adriaensen |access-date= 26 January 2015 |archive-date= 1 January 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150101153432/http://www.brothersgibb.org/history-part-3.html |url-status= dead }}</ref>

From 1963 to 1966, the Gibb family lived at 171 Bunnerong Road, [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra]], in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news|last= Mitchell |first= Alex|title= Bob Carr's tribute to Bee Gees |url= https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/29/1085641764104.html|access-date= 16 April 2012|newspaper= Sydney Morning Herald|date= 30 May 2004}}</ref> Just before his death, Robin Gibb recorded the song "Sydney" about the brothers' experience of living in that city.

A minor hit in 1965, "[[Wine and Women]]", led to the group's first LP, ''[[The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs]]''. By 1966 Festival Records was, however, on the verge of dropping them from the Leedon roster because of their perceived lack of commercial success. At this time the brothers met the American-born songwriter, producer, and entrepreneur [[Nat Kipner]], who had just been appointed A&R manager of a new independent [[Record label|label]], [[Spin Records (Australian label)|Spin Records]]. Kipner briefly took over as the group's manager and successfully negotiated their transfer to Spin in exchange for granting Festival the Australian distribution rights to the group's recordings.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MILESAGO – Record Labels – Spin Records|url=http://www.milesago.com/Industry/spin.htm|access-date=31 October 2020|website=www.milesago.com}}</ref> Through Kipner the Bee Gees met engineer-producer, [[Ossie Byrne]], who produced (or co-produced with Kipner) many of the earlier Spin recordings, most of which were cut at his own small, self-built St Clair Studio in the Sydney suburb of [[Hurstville, New South Wales|Hurstville]]. Byrne gave the Gibb brothers virtually unlimited access to St Clair Studio over a period of several months in mid-1966.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.milesago.com/industry/downunder.htm |title=DOWNUNDER RECORDS |publisher=milesago.com |access-date=17 February 2015}}</ref> The group later acknowledged that this enabled them to significantly improve their skills as recording artists. During this productive time, they recorded a large batch of original material—including the song that became their first major hit, "[[Spicks and Specks (song)|Spicks and Specks]]" (on which Byrne played the trumpet coda)—as well as cover versions of current hits by overseas acts such as the Beatles. They regularly collaborated with other local musicians, including members of beat band Steve & The Board, led by [[Steve Kipner]], Nat's teenage son.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/global/1261998/bee-gees-former-label-boss-nat-kipner-dies |title=Bee Gees' Former Label Boss Nat Kipner Dies |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=9 December 2009 |access-date=17 February 2015 |archive-date=15 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615132451/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/global/1261998/bee-gees-former-label-boss-nat-kipner-dies |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Frustrated by their lack of success, the Gibbs began their return journey to England on 4&nbsp;January 1967, with Ossie Byrne travelling with them. While at sea in January 1967, the Gibbs learned that ''[[Go-Set]]'', Australia's most popular and influential music newspaper, had declared "Spicks and Specks" the "Best Single of the Year".<ref>{{cite web|date=16 July 2010|title=Those old hits keep Stayin' Alive|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/those-old-hits-keep-stayin-alive/news-story/add1a4b056245ba1b95a44036da3ff53|access-date=31 October 2020|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au}}</ref>

Before their departure from Australia to England, Hugh Gibb sent demos to [[Brian Epstein]], who managed [[the Beatles]] and directed NEMS, a British music store. Epstein passed the demo tapes to [[Robert Stigwood]], who had recently joined NEMS.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/487863/robin-gibb-of-the-bee-gees-dead-at-62 |title=Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees Dead at 62 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |last=Graff |first=Gary |date=20 May 2012 |access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref> After an audition with Stigwood in February 1967, the Bee Gees signed a five-year contract whereby [[Polydor Records]] would release their records in the UK, and [[Atco Records]] would do so in the US. Work quickly began on the group's first international album, and Stigwood launched a promotional campaign to coincide with its release.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exdHqRsPWAUC&q=robert+stigwood+audition+bee+gees&pg=PT5 |title=Rock Stars Do The Dumbest Things |first1=Margaret | last1 = Moser | first2 = Bill | last2 = Crawford |access-date=19 February 2015|isbn=9781429978385 |date=April 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Publishing }}</ref>

Stigwood proclaimed that the Bee Gees were "The most significant new musical talent of 1967", thus initiating the comparison of the Bee Gees to the Beatles. Before recording the first album, the group expanded to include [[Colin Petersen]] and [[Vince Melouney]].<ref name="ink">{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/the-brief-movie-stardom-of-colin-smiley-petersen/|magazine=Filmink|date=26 November 2024|access-date=26 November 2024|title=The Brief Movie Stardom of Colin (Smiley) Petersen}}</ref><ref name= pc49>{{cite journal|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19826/m1/ |title=Show 49 – The British are Coming!

No such chicanery was needed to boost the Bee Gees' next single, "[[To Love Somebody (song)|To Love Somebody]]", into the US Top 20. Originally written for [[Otis Redding]], "To Love Somebody", a soulful ballad sung by Barry, has since become a pop standard recorded by many singers.<ref>{{cite web|title=To Love Somebody – The Songs Of The Bee Gees 1966–1970 – Record Collector Magazine|url=https://staging-www.recordcollectormag.com/reviews/album/love-somebody-songs-bee-gees-1966-1970|access-date=31 October 2020|language=en-US|archive-date=11 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111105718/https://staging-www.recordcollectormag.com/reviews/album/love-somebody-songs-bee-gees-1966-1970|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another single, "[[Holiday (Bee Gees song)|Holiday]]", released in the US, peaked at No.&nbsp;16.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Bee Gees|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/bee-gees/chart-history/hsi/|access-date=31 October 2020|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

The parent album, ''[[Bee Gees' 1st|Bee Gees 1st]]'' (their first internationally), peaked at No.&nbsp;7 in the US and No.&nbsp;8 in the UK. Bill Shepherd was credited as the arranger. After recording that album, the group recorded their first BBC session at the [[Playhouse Theatre]], [[Northumberland Avenue]], in London, with Bill Bebb as the producer, and they performed three songs. That session is included on ''BBC Sessions: 1967–1973'' (2008).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Bee-Gees-The-BBC-Sessions-1967-1973/release/1478006 |title=Bee Gees, The* – BBC Sessions 1967–1973 |publisher=Discogs |access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref> After the release of ''Bee Gees' 1st'', the group was first introduced in New York as "the English surprise".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ykEAAAAMBAJ&q=bee+gees+bee+gees%27+1st+billboard&pg=PA7 |title=The Children of Rock; Belt the Blues |last=Goldstein |first=Richard |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=20 July 1967 |access-date=24 January 2015}}</ref> At that time, the band made their first British TV appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.

In late 1967, they began recording their second album. On 21&nbsp;December 1967, in a live broadcast from [[Liverpool Cathedral|Liverpool Anglican Cathedral]] for a Christmas television special called ''How On Earth?,'' they performed their own song, "Thank You For Christmas" which was written especially for the programme, as well as a medley of the traditional Christmas carols "[[Silent Night]]", "[[The First Noel]]" and "[[Mary's Boy Child]]" (the latter incorrectly noted as "[[Hark! The Herald Angels Sing]]" on tape boxes and subsequent release). The songs were all pre-recorded on 1&nbsp;December 1967 and the group lip-synched their performance. The recordings were eventually released on the "Horizontal" reissue bonus disc in 2008. The folk group [[The Settlers (band)|the Settlers]] and Radio 1 disc-jockey, [[Kenny Everett]], also performed on the programme, which was presented by the Reverend Edward H.

The ''Horizontal'' album reached No.&nbsp;12 in the US and No.&nbsp;16 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/12951/bee-gees/|work=[[Official Charts]]|title=Official Charts - Bee Gees|access-date=24 January 2024}}</ref>

With the release of ''Horizontal'', they also embarked on a Scandinavian tour with concerts in [[Copenhagen]]. Around the same time, the Bee Gees turned down an offer to write and perform the soundtrack for the film ''[[Wonderwall (film)|Wonderwall]]'', according to director [[Joe Massot]].{{Sfn|Bilyeu|Cook|Hughes|2009}}

On 27 February 1968, the band, backed by the 17-piece Massachusetts String Orchestra, began their first tour of Germany with two concerts at [[Laeiszhalle|Hamburg Musikhalle]]. In March 1968, the band was supported by [[Procol Harum]] (who had a hit "[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]") on their German tour.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DMDAwAAQBAJ&q=bee+gees+procol+harum&pg=PT68 |title=Procol Harum: The Ghosts Of A Whiter Shade of Pale |first=Henry | last = Scott-Irvine |access-date=19 February 2015|isbn=9780857128027 |date=20 November 2012 |publisher=Omnibus Press }}</ref> As Robin's partner Molly Hullis recalls: "Germans were wilder than the fans in England at the heights of [[Beatlemania]]." The tour schedule took them to 11 venues in as many days with 18 concerts played, finishing with a brace of shows at the Stadthalle, [[Braunschweig]].

After that, the group was off to [[Switzerland]]. As Maurice described it:

{{blockquote|There were over 5,000 kids at the airport in Zurich. The entire ride to Bern, the kids were waving Union Jacks. When we got to the hotel, the police weren't there to meet us and the kids crushed the car. We were inside and the windows were all getting smashed in, and we were on the floor.{{Sfn|Bilyeu|Cook|Hughes|2009}} }}

On 17 March, the band performed "Words" on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. The other artists who performed on that night's show were [[Lucille Ball]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Fran Jeffries]].<ref>{{Citation |contribution-url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-ed-sullivan-show/march-17-1968-the-bee-gees-lucille-ball-george-hamilton-fran-jeffries-108953/ |title=The Ed Sullivan show |contribution=17 March 1968: The Bee Gees, Lucille Ball, George Hamilton, Fran Jeffries |publisher=TV |access-date=14 May 2013 |archive-date=17 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017035552/http://www.tv.com/shows/the-ed-sullivan-show/march-17-1968-the-bee-gees-lucille-ball-george-hamilton-fran-jeffries-108953/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 27&nbsp;March 1968, the band performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.{{Sfn|Bilyeu|Cook|Hughes|2009}}

[[File:The Bee Gees.png|thumb|The Bee Gees performing on Dutch television ''Twien'' in 1968]]
Two more singles followed in early 1968: the ballad "[[Words (Bee Gees song)|Words]]" (No.&nbsp;8 UK, No.&nbsp;15 US) and the double A-sided single "[[Jumbo (Bee Gees song)|Jumbo]]" backed with "[[The Singer Sang His Song]]". "Jumbo" only reached No.&nbsp;25 in the UK and No.&nbsp;57 in the US. The Bee Gees felt "The Singer Sang His Song" was the stronger of the two sides, an opinion shared by listeners in the [[Netherlands]] who made it a No.&nbsp;3 hit.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Further Bee Gees chart singles followed: "[[I've Gotta Get a Message to You]]", their second UK No.&nbsp;1 (No.&nbsp;8 US), and "[[I Started a Joke]]" (No.&nbsp;6 US), both culled from the band's third album ''[[Idea (album)|Idea]]''.<ref name="Charts" /> ''Idea'' reached No.&nbsp;4 in the UK and was another top 20 album in the US (No.&nbsp;17).<ref name="Charts" />

After the tour and TV special to promote the album, Vince Melouney left the group, desiring to play more of a blues style music than the Gibbs were writing. Melouney did achieve one feat while with the Bee Gees: his "[[Idea (album)|Such a Shame]]" (from ''Idea'') is the only song on any Bee Gees album not written by a Gibb brother.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

The band were due to begin a seven-week tour of the US on 2&nbsp;August 1968, but on 27&nbsp;July, Robin collapsed and fell unconscious. He was admitted to a London nursing home for nervous exhaustion, and the American tour was postponed.{{Sfn|Bilyeu|Cook|Hughes|2009}} The band began recording their sixth album, which resulted in their spending a week recording at [[Atlantic Studios]] in New York. Robin, still feeling poorly, missed the New York sessions, but the rest of the band put away instrumental tracks and demos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/68.html |work=Gibb Songs |title=1968 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |publisher=Columbia |access-date=14 May 2013}}</ref>

====''Odessa'', ''Cucumber Castle'' and break-up====
[[File:The Bee Gees - This is Tom Jones, Season 1, Episode 3 (1969).jpg|thumb|right|The Bee Gees performing at ''[[This Is Tom Jones|The Tom Jones Show]]'' in early 1969, one of the last performances with Robin as he left the group later in March]]
By 1969, Robin began to feel that Stigwood had been favouring Barry as the frontman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-15431875|title=Obituary: Robin Gibb|date=21 May 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>

The Bee Gees' performances in early 1969 on the ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[This Is Tom Jones|The Tom Jones Show]]'', singing "I Started a Joke" and "First of May" as a medley, were the final appearances of the group with Robin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/69.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1969 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |access-date=17 February 2015}}</ref>

Their next album, which was to have been a concept album called ''Masterpeace'', evolved into the double-album ''[[Odessa (Bee Gees album)|Odessa]]''. Most rock critics felt this was the best Bee Gees album of the 1960s with its progressive rock feel on the [[Odessa (City on the Black Sea)|title track]], the country-flavoured "[[Marley Purt Drive]]" and "[[Odessa (Bee Gees album)|Give Your Best]]", and ballads such as "[[Melody Fair]]" and "[[First of May (Bee Gees song)|First of May]]" (the last of which became the only single from the album and a UK # 6 hit). Feeling the flipside, "[[Lamplight]]", should have been the A-side, Robin quit the group in mid-1969 and launched a solo career.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/arts/music/robin-gibb-62-member-of-the-bee-gees-dies-at-62.html|work=[[New York Times]]|date=20 May 2012|title=Robin Gibb, a Bee Gee With a Taciturn Manner, Dies at 62|first=Ben|last= Sisario|access-date=22 January 2024}}</ref>

The first of many Bee Gees compilations, ''[[Best of Bee Gees]]'', was released featuring the non-LP single "[[Words (Bee Gees song)|Words]]" plus the Australian hit "[[Spicks and Specks (song)|Spicks and Specks]]". The single "[[Tomorrow Tomorrow (Bee Gees song)|Tomorrow Tomorrow]]" was also released and was a moderate hit in the UK, where it reached No.&nbsp;23, but it was only No.&nbsp;54 in the US. The compilation reached the top 10 in both the UK and the US.<ref name="Charts" />

While Robin pursued his solo career, Barry, Maurice and Petersen continued as the Bee Gees on their next album, ''[[Cucumber Castle]]''. The band made their debut performance without Robin at [[Hippodrome, London#The Talk of the Town|Talk of the Town]]. They had recruited their sister, Lesley, to participate in at least one performance at this time as a replacement for Robin.<ref name="Lesley Gibb 1969">{{cite web |title=Lesley Gibb Joins Brothers of the Bee Gees |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/detroit-free-press-bu-lesley-gibb-jo/34585743/ |website=Newspaper.com |publisher=Detroit Free Press |access-date=21 March 2024 |date=4 July 1969}}</ref> To accompany the album, they also filmed a [[Cucumber Castle (film)|TV special]] with [[Frankie Howerd]] and cameos from several other contemporary pop and rock stars, which aired on the BBC in December 1970. Petersen played drums on the tracks recorded for the album but was fired from the group after filming began (he went on to form the [[Humpy Bong]] with [[Jonathan Kelly]]). His parts were edited out of the final cut of the film and [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]] drummer [[Terry Cox]] was recruited to complete the recording of songs for the album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/2016/10/friday-nuggets-early-bee-gees-drum-fun/|title=Friday Nuggets: Early Bee Gees Drum Fun

After the album was released in early 1970, it seemed that the Bee Gees were finished. The leadoff single, "[[Don't Forget to Remember]]", was a big hit in the UK, reaching No.&nbsp;2, but only reached No.&nbsp;73 in the US. The next two singles, "[[I.O.I.O.]]" and "[[If Only I Had My Mind on Something Else|If I Only Had My Mind on Something Else]]", barely scraped the charts. On 1&nbsp;December 1969, Barry and Maurice parted ways professionally.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sandoval|first=Andrew|title=The Day-By-Day Story, 1945–1972|year=2012|publisher=Retrofuture Day-By-Day|isbn=978-0-943249-08-7 |pages=102–115 |edition=1st |type=paperback}}</ref>

Maurice started to record his first solo album, ''[[The Loner (Maurice Gibb album)|The Loner]]'', which was not released. Meanwhile, he released the single "[[Railroad (song)|Railroad]]" and starred in the West End musical ''Sing a Rude Song''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdustsucker.de/disco/alben/railroad.htm |title=Bee Gees Discography: Maurice Gibb – Railroad (Single) |publisher=Mcdustsucker.de |access-date=17 February 2015}}</ref> In February 1970, Barry recorded a solo album which never saw official release either, although "[[I'll Kiss Your Memory]]" was released as a single backed by "This Time" without much interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Barry-Gibb-Ill-Kiss-Your-Memory-This-Time/release/1544685 |title=Barry Gibb – I'll Kiss Your Memory / This Time |date=May 1970 |publisher=Discogs |access-date=17 February 2015}}</ref> Meanwhile, Robin saw chart success in Europe and Australia with his UK No.&nbsp;2 hit "[[Saved by the Bell (song)|Saved by the Bell]]" from the album ''[[Robin's Reign]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11536234/Lost-Robin-Gibb-album-to-be-released-thanks-to-fans.html|title='Lost' Robin Gibb album to be released thanks to fans|first=Hannah|last=Furness|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]]|access-date=24 January 2024|date=14 April 2015}}</ref>

===1970–1974: Reformation===
[[File:Bee Gees Midnight Special 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The Bee Gees performing at ''The Midnight Special'' in 1973]]
In mid 1970, according to Barry, "Robin rang me in Spain where I was on holiday [saying] 'let's do it again'". By 21&nbsp;August 1970, after they had reunited, Barry announced that the Bee Gees "are there and they will never, ever part again". Maurice said, "We just discussed it and re-formed. We want to apologise publicly to Robin for the things that have been said."<ref name="were" /> Earlier, in June 1970, Robin and Maurice recorded a dozen songs before Barry joined and included two songs that were on their reunion album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/70.html|title=Gibb Songs : 1970|work=columbia.edu}}</ref> Around the same time, Barry and Robin were about to publish the book ''On the Other Hand''.<ref name="were" /> They also recruited [[Geoff Bridgford]] as the group's official drummer. Bridgford had previously worked with [[The Groove (band)|the Groove]] and [[Tin Tin (band)|Tin Tin]] and played drums on Maurice's unreleased first solo album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/69.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1969 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |access-date=30 November 2014}}</ref>

In 1970, ''[[2 Years On]]'' was released in October in the US and November in the UK. The lead single "[[Lonely Days]]" reached No.&nbsp;3 in the United States, promoted by appearances on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]],'' ''[[Johnny Carson]]'s [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]'', ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.<ref name="were" />

Their ninth album, ''[[Trafalgar (album)|Trafalgar]]'', was released in late 1971. The single "[[How Can You Mend a Broken Heart]]" was their first to hit No.&nbsp;1 on the US charts, while "[[Israel (Bee Gees song)|Israel]]" reached No.&nbsp;22 in the Netherlands. "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart" also brought the Bee Gees their first [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]. Later that year, the group's songs were included in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Melody (1971 film)|Melody]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/19/the-bee-gees-40-greatest-songs-ranked|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=22 January 2024|title=The Bee Gees' 40 greatest songs – ranked!|first=Alexis|last=Petridis|date=19 January 2023}}</ref>

In 1972, they hit No. 16 in the US with the non-album single "[[My World (Bee Gees song)|My World]]", backed by Maurice's composition "[[On Time (song)|On Time]]". Another 1972 single, "[[Run to Me (Bee Gees song)|Run to Me]]" from the LP ''[[To Whom It May Concern (Bee Gees album)|To Whom It May Concern]]'', returned them to the UK top 10 for the first time in three years.<ref name="Charts" /> Bridgford left the group partway through recording, and the band chose not to hire a new member to replace him.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/bee-gees-10-best-songs/|title=The 10 best Bee Gees songs of all time|magazine=Far Out Magazine|access-date=22 January 2024|first=Tyler|last=Golson|date=1 September 2021}}</ref> The resulting three-piece lineup of Barry, Robin and Maurice would remain unbroken for the remainder of the band's active years. On 24&nbsp;November 1972, the band headlined the "Woodstock of the West" Festival at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Los Angeles Coliseum]] (which was a West Coast answer to [[Woodstock]] in New York), which also featured [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1972-the-los-angeles-coliseum-plays-host-to-the-woodstock-of-the-west/ |title=1972 – The Los Angeles Coliseum plays host to the Woodstock of the West |publisher=This Day in Rock |first1=Stu |last1=Sweatman |access-date=15 February 2015 |url-status=usurped |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150215162832/http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1972-the-los-angeles-coliseum-plays-host-to-the-woodstock-of-the-west/ |archive-date= 15 February 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kdkb-fm.firstmediaworks.com/article.asp?id=579627|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215182715/http://kdkb-fm.firstmediaworks.com/article.asp?id=579627|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 February 2015|title= November 24|publisher=93.3 KDKB Rocks Arizona |access-date=15 February 2015}}</ref> Also in 1972, the group sang "[[Hey Jude]]" with [[Wilson Pickett]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoQ2RglvBl4 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/KoQ2RglvBl4| archive-date=11 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=Wilson Pickett and Bee Gees Hey Jude |author=POLLOIDER |date=26 February 2007 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=15 February 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

By 1973, however, the Bee Gees were in a rut. The album ''[[Life in a Tin Can]]'', released on Robert Stigwood's newly formed [[RSO Records]], and its lead-off single, "[[Saw a New Morning]]", sold poorly with the single peaking at No.&nbsp;94. This was followed by an unreleased album (known as ''[[A Kick in the Head Is Worth Eight in the Pants]]''). They also released an album only available in South America, ''[[Kitty Can (album)|Kitty Can]]''. Another compilation album, ''[[Best of Bee Gees, Volume 2]]'', was released in 1973, although it did not repeat the success of [[Best of Bee Gees|Volume 1]]. On 6&nbsp;April 1973 episode of ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' they performed "[[Money (That's What I Want)]]" with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHQGdh2CTWs |author=JerryLeeLewisTV |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/CHQGdh2CTWs| archive-date=11 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=Jerry Lee Lewis & Bee Gees -Money (Live 1973) |date=13 February 2009 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=17 February 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Also in 1973, they were invited by [[Chuck Berry]] to perform two songs with him onstage at ''The Midnight Special'': "[[Johnny B.

On the advice of [[Ahmet Ertegun]], head of their US label [[Atlantic Records]], Stigwood arranged for the group to record with [[soul music]] producer [[Arif Mardin]]. The resulting LP, ''[[Mr. Natural (Bee Gees album)|Mr. Natural]]'', included fewer ballads and foreshadowed the [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] direction of the rest of their career. When it, too, failed to attract much interest, Mardin encouraged them to work within the soul music style. The brothers attempted to assemble a live stage band that could replicate their studio sound. Lead guitarist [[Alan Kendall]] had come on board in 1971 but did not have much to do until ''Mr. Natural''. For that album, they added drummer Dennis Bryon, and they later added ex-[[Strawbs]] keyboard player Blue Weaver, completing the Bee Gees band that lasted through the late 1970s. Maurice, who had previously performed on piano, guitar, harpsichord, electric piano, organ, [[mellotron]] and bass guitar, as well as [[mandolin]] and [[Moog synthesizer|Moog synthesiser]], by then confined himself to bass onstage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/jan/10/a-diminished-chord-the-story-of-the-bee-gees/|date=10 January 2021|access-date=22 January 2024|first=Philip|last=Martin|title= CRITICAL MASS: A diminished chord — The story of the Bee Gees|

At [[Eric Clapton]]'s suggestion, the brothers moved to [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], early in 1975 to record at [[Criteria Studios]]. After starting off with ballads, they eventually heeded the urging of Mardin and Stigwood, and crafted more dance-oriented [[disco]] songs, including their second US No.&nbsp;1, "[[Jive Talkin']]", along with US No.&nbsp;7 "[[Nights on Broadway]]". The band liked the resulting new sound. This time the public agreed by sending the LP ''[[Main Course]]'' up the charts. This album included the first Bee Gees songs wherein Barry used [[falsetto]],<ref>{{cite web |last=James|first=Nicholas|title=Main Course – Bee Gees|url=http://www.beegeesreviews.info/reviews/maincourse.htm|work=Bee Gees reviews |access-date=8 December 2012}}</ref> something that became a trademark of the band.

On the Bee Gees' appearance on ''The Midnight Special'' in 1975, to promote ''Main Course'', they sang "To Love Somebody" with [[Helen Reddy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_GJ9uEhQg |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/Mh_GJ9uEhQg| archive-date=11 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=HELEN REDDY JAMMING WITH THE BEE GEES – MIDNIGHT SPECIAL – THE QUEEN OF 70s POP |date=30 January 2012 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=17 February 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Around the same time, the Bee Gees recorded three Beatles covers—"[[Golden Slumbers]]/[[Carry That Weight]]", "[[She Came In Through the Bathroom Window|She Came in Through the Bathroom Window]]" with Barry providing lead vocals, and "[[Sun King (song)|Sun King]]" with Maurice providing lead vocals, for the unsuccessful musical/documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/75.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1975 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |access-date=1 December 2014}}</ref>

The next album, ''[[Children of the World]]'', released in September 1976, was filled with Barry's new-found falsetto and Weaver's synthesizer disco licks.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The first single from the album was "[[You Should Be Dancing]]", which features percussion work by musician [[Stephen Stills]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/stephen-stills-interview-were-still-here-haha-haha-ha-8772387.html |title=Stephen Stills interview: 'We're still here, haha haha ha!' |date=17 August 2013 |access-date=17 February 2015}}</ref> The song pushed the Bee Gees to a level of stardom they had not previously achieved in the US, though their new R&B/disco sound was not as popular with some diehard fans.

====''Saturday Night Fever'' and ''Spirits Having Flown''====
Following a successful live album, ''[[Here at Last... Bee Gees... Live]]'', the Bee Gees agreed with Stigwood to participate in the creation of the [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack]]. It was a turning point in their career. The cultural impact of both the film and the soundtrack was significant throughout the world, and epitomized the [[disco]] phenomenon on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=James|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/01/14/DD113470.DTL&hw=appreciate&sn=223&sc=222 |title=APPRECIATION / Contributor to a sound that went beyond disco |website=sfgate.com|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=14 January 2003 |access-date=27 December 2021}}</ref>

{{blockquote|They flipped out and said these will be great. We still had no concept of the movie, except some kind of rough script that they'd brought with them.&nbsp;... You've got to remember, we were fairly dead in the water at that point, 1975, somewhere in that zone—the Bee Gees' sound was basically tired. We needed something new. We hadn't had a hit record in about three years. So we felt, Oh Jeez, that's it. That's our life span, like most groups in the late '60s. So, we had to find something. We didn't know what was going to happen.<ref name="Kashner" />}}

Bill Oakes, who supervised the soundtrack, asserts that ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' did not begin the disco craze but rather prolonged it: "Disco had run its course. These days, ''Fever'' is credited with kicking off the whole disco thing—it really didn't. Truth is, it breathed new life into a genre that was actually dying."<ref name="Kashner" />

Three Bee Gees singles—"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]" (US No.&nbsp;1, UK No.&nbsp;3), "[[Stayin' Alive]]" (US No.&nbsp;1, UK No.&nbsp;4) and "[[Night Fever]]" (US No.&nbsp;1, UK No.&nbsp;1)—charted high in many countries around the world, launching the most popular period of the disco era.<ref name="Charts"/> They also penned the song "[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]", which became a US No.&nbsp;1 hit for [[Yvonne Elliman]], while the Bee Gees' own version was the B-side of "Stayin' Alive". Such was the popularity of ''Saturday Night Fever'' that two different versions of the song "[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than a Woman]]" received airplay, one by the Bee Gees, which was relegated to an album track, and another by [[Tavares (group)|Tavares]], which was the hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smoothradio.com/artists/bee-gees/more-than-a-woman-which-version-is-best/|title=More Than A Woman - Which Version Is Best?|work=[[Smooth Radio (2014)|Smooth Radio]]|access-date=22 January 2024|publisher=[[Global Media & Entertainment|Global]]|date=2 December 2014|archive-date=19 January 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240119193842/https://www.smoothradio.com/artists/bee-gees/more-than-a-woman-which-version-is-best/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During a nine-month period beginning in the Christmas season of 1977, [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number ones of 1978|seven songs]] written by the brothers held the No.&nbsp;1 position on the US charts for 27 of 37 consecutive weeks: three of their own releases, two for brother [[Andy Gibb]], the [[Yvonne Elliman]] single, and "[[Grease (song)|Grease]]", performed by [[Frankie Valli]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/78.html|title=Gibb Songs: 1978|publisher=Columbia University|access-date=4 December 2023}}</ref>

Fuelled by the film's success, the soundtrack broke multiple industry records, becoming the highest-selling album in recording history to that point. With more than 40&nbsp;million copies sold, ''Saturday Night Fever'' is among music's top five best selling soundtrack albums. {{as of|2010}}, it is calculated as the [[List of best-selling albums|fourth highest-selling album]] worldwide.<ref name="Everyhit records">{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/recordalb.html|title=Record-Breakers and Trivia—Albums|publisher=Every hit |access-date=28 November 2011}}</ref>

In March 1978, the Bee Gees held the top two positions on the US charts with "Night Fever" and "Stayin' Alive", the first time this had happened since the Beatles. On the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for 25&nbsp;March 1978, five songs written by the Gibbs were in the US top 10 at the same time: "Night Fever", "Stayin' Alive", "If I Can't Have You", "Emotion" and "Love Is Thicker Than Water". Such chart dominance had not been seen since April 1964, when the Beatles had all five of the top five American singles. Barry Gibb became the only songwriter to have four consecutive number-one hits in the US, breaking the [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] 1964 record. These songs were "Stayin' Alive", "Love Is Thicker Than Water", "Night Fever" and "If I Can't Have You".<ref>{{cite web|last=Brownfield|first=Troy|title=Beating the Beatles: Can Anyone Take the Top Five Again?|url=https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2019/04/beating-the-beatles-can-anyone-take-the-top-five-again/|website=saturdayeveningpost.com|publisher=Saturday Evening Post|date=4 April 2019|access-date=27 December 2021}}</ref>

The Bee Gees won five [[Grammy Awards]] for ''Saturday Night Fever'' over two years: [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical|Producer of the Year]] (with Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson), two awards for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] (one in 1978 for "How Deep Is Your Love" and one in 1979 for "Stayin' Alive"), and [[Grammy Award for Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices|Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices]] for "Stayin' Alive".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1979/02/16/grammy-awards-billy-joels-ballad-upsets-bees-gees-anthem/c898e39c-34f5-4825-9d98-714d869a6668/|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|title= Billy Joel's Ballad Upsets Bees Gees' Anthem|first1=Joseph|last1=McLellan|first2=Eve|last2=Zibart|access-date=22 January 2024|date=16 February 1979}}</ref>

During this era, Barry and Robin also wrote "[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]" for an old friend, Australian vocalist [[Samantha Sang]], who made it a top 10 hit, with the Bee Gees singing backing vocals. Barry also wrote the title song to the film version of the Broadway musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' for [[Frankie Valli]] to perform, which went to No.&nbsp;1.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/why-didnt-barry-gibb-sing-the-grease-theme-song/|access-date=22 January 2024|first=Tyler|last=Golsen|title=Why didn't Barry Gibb sing the 'Grease' theme song?|date=17 September 2023|magazine=Far Out Magazine}}</ref>

The Bee Gees also co-starred with [[Peter Frampton]] in Robert Stigwood's film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1978), loosely inspired by the classic 1967 album by the Beatles. The movie had been heavily promoted prior to release and was expected to enjoy great commercial success. However, it was savaged by film critics as a disjointed mess and ignored by the public. The soundtrack charted top five in the U.S., but only top 38 in Britain. The single "[[Oh! Darling]]", credited to Robin Gibb, reached No.&nbsp;15 in the US.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Robin Gibb|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/robin-gibb/chart-history/hsi/|access-date=27 October 2021|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

The Bee Gees' follow-up to ''Saturday Night Fever'' was the ''[[Spirits Having Flown]]'' album. It yielded three more hits: "[[Too Much Heaven]]" (US No.&nbsp;1, UK No.&nbsp;3), "[[Tragedy (Bee Gees song)|Tragedy]]" (US No.&nbsp;1, UK No.&nbsp;1), and "[[Love You Inside Out]]" (US No.&nbsp;1, UK No.&nbsp;13).<ref name="Charts" /> This gave the act six consecutive No.&nbsp;1 singles in the US within a year and a half, equalling the Beatles and surpassed only by [[Whitney Houston]].<ref name="singles">{{cite journal| title=Jet |journal=Jet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WLADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54|date=2 May 1988|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=54|issn=0021-5996}}</ref>

In January 1979, the Bee Gees performed "Too Much Heaven" as their contribution to the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]].<ref>Fred Bronson, "Too Much Heaven", in ''The Billboard Book of Number One Hits'' (Los Angeles: Billboard Books, 2003), 496. {{ISBN|0823076776}}, 9780823076772</ref> During the summer of 1979, the Bee Gees embarked on their largest concert tour covering the US and Canada. The [[Spirits Having Flown Tour|Spirits Having Flown tour]] capitalised on Bee Gees fever that was sweeping the nation, with sold-out concerts in 38 cities. The Bee Gees produced a video for the title track "[[Too Much Heaven]]", directed by Miami-based filmmaker Martin Pitts and produced by Charles Allen. With this video, Pitts and Allen began a long association with the brothers.<ref>On Pitts, see https://imvdb.com/n/martin-pitts</ref>

The Bee Gees even had a country hit in 1979 with "[[Rest Your Love on Me]]", the flip side of their pop hit "Too Much Heaven", which made the top 40 on the country charts. It was also a 1981 hit for [[Conway Twitty]], topping the [[country music]] charts.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944–2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=360}}</ref>

The Bee Gees' success rose and fell with the disco bubble. By the end of 1979, disco was rapidly declining in popularity, and the backlash against disco put the Bee Gees' American career in a tailspin. Encouraged by [[Steve Dahl]]'s [[Disco Demolition Night]], radio stations around the US began promoting "Bee Gee-Free Weekends". Following their remarkable run from 1975 to 1979, the act had only one more top 10 single in the US, and that did not come until the single "One" reached number 7 in 1989.<ref name="rank">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/487819/bee-gees-rank-third-among-groups-for-most-hot-100-no-1s-in-history|title=Bee Gees Rank Third Among Groups for Most Hot 100 No. 1s in History|magazine=Billboard| access-date =9 November 2019|date=21 May 2012|first=Keith|last=Caulfield}}</ref>

Barry Gibb considered the success of the ''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack both a blessing and a curse:

{{blockquote|''Fever'' was No. 1 every week&nbsp;... It wasn't just like a hit album. It was No.&nbsp;1 every single week for 25 weeks. It was just an amazing, crazy, extraordinary time. I remember not being able to answer the phone, and I remember people climbing over my walls. I was quite grateful when it stopped. It was too unreal. In the long run, your life is better if it's not like that on a constant basis. Nice though it was.<ref name="Kashner" />}}

===1980–1986: Outside projects, band turmoil, solo efforts and decline===
Robin co-produced [[Jimmy Ruffin]]'s ''[[Sunrise (Jimmy Ruffin album)|Sunrise]]'' released in May 1980, but the songs were started in 1979; the album contains songs written by the Gibb brothers, including the single "Hold On To My Love".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/80.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1980 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |access-date=1 December 2014}}</ref>

In March 1980, Barry Gibb worked with [[Barbra Streisand]] on her album ''[[Guilty (Barbra Streisand album)|Guilty]]''. He co-produced, and wrote or co-wrote all nine of the album's tracks (four of them written with Robin, and the title track with both Robin and Maurice). Barry also appeared on the album's cover with Streisand and duetted with her on two tracks. The album reached No.&nbsp;1 in both the US and the UK, as did the single "[[Woman in Love]]" (written by Barry and Robin), becoming Streisand's most successful single and album to date. Both of the Streisand/Gibb duets, "[[Guilty (Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb song)|Guilty]]" and "[[What Kind of Fool]]", also reached the US Top 10.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.sony.com/content/sony/en/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-music-entertainment/2005/new-barbra-streisandbarry-gibb-collaborative-album-guilty-pleasures-to-be-released-as-cd-and-dualdisc-on-tuesday-september-20.html|title=New Barbra Streisand-Barry Gibb Collaborative Album, 'Guilty Pleasures,' to be Released as CD and DualDisc on Tuesday, September 20|work=[[Sony Music Entertainment]]|date=29 August 2005|access-date=22 January 2024}}</ref>

In 1981, the Bee Gees released the album ''[[Living Eyes (Bee Gees album)|Living Eyes]]'', their last full-length album release on RSO. This album was the first CD ever played in public, when it was played to viewers of the BBC show ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bilyeu|first1=Melinda|first2=Hector |last2=Cook |first3=Andrew Môn |last3=Hughes |publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-84449-057-8|title=The Bee Gees: tales of the brothers Gibb|page=519}}</ref> With the disco backlash still running strong, the album failed to make the UK or US Top 40—breaking their streak of Top 40 hits, which started in 1975 with "[[Jive Talkin']]". Two singles from the album fared little better—"[[He's a Liar]]", which reached No.&nbsp;30 in the US, and "[[Living Eyes (song)|Living Eyes]]", which reached No.&nbsp;45.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In 1982, [[Dionne Warwick]] enjoyed a UK No.&nbsp;2 and US [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary No.&nbsp;1]] hit with her comeback single, "[[Heartbreaker (Dionne Warwick song)|Heartbreaker]]", taken from her [[Heartbreaker (Dionne Warwick album)|album of the same name]], written largely by the Bee Gees and co-produced by Barry Gibb. The album reached No.&nbsp;3 in the UK and the Top 30 in the US, where it was certified Gold.

A year later, [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Kenny Rogers]] recorded the Bee Gees-penned track "[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]", which became a US and Australian No.&nbsp;1 hit and entered the Top 10 in the UK. Rogers' 1983 album, ''[[Eyes That See in the Dark]]'', was written entirely by the Bee Gees and co-produced by Barry. The album was a Top 10 hit in the US and was certified Double Platinum.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country-lists/kenny-rogers-10-essential-songs-970871/islands-in-the-stream-1983-970879/|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=21 March 2020|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|first2=Jon|last2=Freeman|title=Kenny Rogers: 10 Essential Songs|access-date=24 January 2024}}</ref>

The Bee Gees had greater success with the [[Staying Alive (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''[[Staying Alive (1983 film)|Staying Alive]]'' in 1983, the sequel to ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''. The soundtrack was certified platinum in the US, and included their Top 30 hit "[[The Woman in You]]".{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Also in 1983, the band was sued by Chicago songwriter [[Selle v. Gibb|Ronald Selle]], who claimed the brothers stole melodic material from one of his songs, "Let It End", and used it in "How Deep Is Your Love". At first, the Bee Gees lost the case; one juror said that a factor in the jury's decision was the Gibbs' failure to introduce expert testimony rebutting the plaintiff's expert testimony that it was "impossible" for the two songs to have been written independently. However, the verdict was overturned a few months later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/83.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1983 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |access-date=1 December 2014}}</ref>

The Bee Gees later got together with [[Eric Clapton]] to create a group called '[[1988 Summer Olympics Album: One Moment in Time|the Bunburys]]' to raise money for English charities. The group recorded three songs for ''The Bunbury Tails'': "We're the Bunburys" (which eventually became the opening theme to the 1992 animated series ''The Bunbury Tails''), "Bunbury Afternoon", and "Fight (No Matter How Long)".

The Bee Gees' next album, ''[[One (Bee Gees album)|One]]'' (1989), featured "Wish You Were Here", a song dedicated to their younger brother [[Andy Gibb|Andy]], who had died in 1988 of [[myocarditis]] resulting from a viral infection. The album also contained their first US Top 10 hit (No.&nbsp;7) in a decade, "One" (an Adult Contemporary No.&nbsp;1).

In the UK, Polydor issued a single-disc hits collection from ''Tales'' called ''[[The Very Best of the Bee Gees]]'', which contained their biggest UK hits.

Following their next album, ''[[High Civilization]]'' (1991), which contained the UK top five hit "[[Secret Love (Bee Gees song)|Secret Love]]", the Bee Gees went on a European tour. After the tour, Barry Gibb began to battle a serious back problem, which required surgery. In addition, he had [[arthritis]] which, at one point, was so severe that it was doubtful that he would be able to play guitar for much longer. Also, in the early 1990s, Maurice Gibb finally sought treatment for his alcoholism, which he had battled for many years with the help of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/jan/18/20030118-084437-1909r/|date=18 January 2023|title=Maurice Gibb's harmonizing influence|work=[[The Washington Times]]|access-date=22 January 2024}}</ref>

In 1993, the group returned to the Polydor label and released the album ''[[Size Isn't Everything]]'', which contained the UK top five hit "For Whom the Bell Tolls". Success still eluded them in the US, however, as the first single released, "[[Paying the Price of Love]]", only managed to reach No.&nbsp;74 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], while the parent album stalled at No.&nbsp;153.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In 1997, they released the album ''[[Still Waters (Bee Gees album)|Still Waters]]'', which has reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK (their highest album chart position there since 1979) and No.&nbsp;11 in the US. The album's first single, "[[Alone (Bee Gees song)|Alone]]", gave them another UK Top 5 hit and a top 30 hit in the US.

==Legacy==
In his 1980 ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine interview, [[John Lennon]] praised the Bee Gees, "Try to tell the kids in the seventies who were screaming to the Bee Gees that their music was just the Beatles redone. There is nothing wrong with the Bee Gees. They do a damn good job. There was nothing else going on then."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/dbjypb.int3.html |title=John Lennon Interview: Playboy 1980 (Page 3) |publisher=The Beatles Ultimate Experience |access-date=13 March 2015}}</ref>

In a 2007 interview with Duane Hitchings, who co-wrote [[Rod Stewart]]'s 1978 disco song "[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]", he noted that the song was<ref name="music" />

{{blockquote|text=a spoof on guys from the 'cocaine lounge lizards' of the ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' days.

[[Kevin Parker (musician)|Kevin Parker]] of [[Tame Impala]] has said that listening to the Bee Gees after taking [[Psilocybin mushroom|mushrooms]] inspired him to change the sound of the music he was making on his album ''[[Currents (Tame Impala album)|Currents]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tame Impala's Kevin Parker reveals listening to the Bee Gees while on drugs inspired his new album |url=https://www.nme.com/news/tame-impala/86681|website=NME|date=4 July 2015|access-date=17 November 2015|language=en-GB}}</ref>

The English [[indie rock]] band [[the Cribs]] was also influenced by the Bee Gees. Cribs member [[Ryan Jarman]] said: "It must have had quite a big influence on us – pop melodies is something we always revert to. I always want to get back to pop melodies and I'm sure that's due to that Bee Gees phase we went through."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-cribs/63913 |title=The Cribs: 'Robin Gibb's music with the Bee Gees really influenced us' – video |work=NME |access-date=10 January 2015}}</ref>

Following Robin's death on 20 May 2012, [[Beyoncé]] remarked: "The Bee Gees were an early inspiration for me, [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle]]. We loved their songwriting and beautiful harmonies. Recording their classic song, 'Emotion' was a special time for Destiny's Child. Sadly we lost Robin Gibb this week.

Singer [[Jordin Sparks]] remarked that her favourite Bee Gees songs are "Too Much Heaven", "Emotion" (although performed by Samantha Sang with Barry on the background vocals using his falsetto), and "Stayin' Alive".<ref name="falsetto">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1685467/robin-gibb-bee-gees-remembered-justin-bieber-carrie-underwood/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219215457/http://www.mtv.com/news/1685467/robin-gibb-bee-gees-remembered-justin-bieber-carrie-underwood/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 February 2015 |title=Robin Gibb Mourned By Justin Bieber, Carrie Underwood |publisher=MTV News |access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref>

[[Carrie Underwood]] said, about discovering the Bee Gees during her childhood, "My parents listened to the Bee Gees quite a bit when I was little, so I was definitely exposed to them at an early age. They just had a sound that was all their own, obviously, never duplicated."<ref name="falsetto" />

The lasting influence of Bee Gees has been observed in the work of contemporary popular music acts such as [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Of Montreal]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Bee Gees Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More {{!}} ... |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bee-gees-mn0000043714 |access-date=2025-03-28 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref>

According to Bruce Eder of AllMusic, Bee Gees were "music's most successful brother act".<ref name=":0" />

Singer-songwriter [[Gavin DeGraw]] spoke about the Bee Gees' influence with their own music as well as their songwriting:

{{blockquote|Let's talk about the Bee Gees. That's an iconic group. Not just a great band, but a great group of songwriters. Even long after the Bee Gees' success on the pop charts, they were still writing songs for other people, huge hit songs. Their talent went far beyond their moment of normal pop success. It is a loss to the music industry and a loss of an iconic group. The beauty of this industry is that we do pay tribute and every artist coming up is a fan of a generation prior to it, so there's a real tradition element to it".<ref name="falsetto"/>}}

In 2009, as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, the Bee Gees were announced as one of the [[List of Queensland's Q150 Icons|Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for their role as "Influential Artists".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND'S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|author-link=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref> <!-- This section is not meant to be an all inclusive list.
