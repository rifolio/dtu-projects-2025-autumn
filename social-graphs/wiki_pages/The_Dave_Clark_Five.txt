'''The Dave Clark Five''', also known as the '''DC5''', were an English [[rock and roll]] band formed in 1958 in [[Tottenham]], London. Drummer [[Dave Clark (musician)|Dave Clark]] was the group's leader, producer and co-songwriter. In January 1964, they had their first UK top-ten single, "[[Glad All Over]]", which knocked [[the Beatles]]' "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]" off the top of the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It peaked at No. 6 in the United States in April 1964.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2008-03-06-dave-clark-five_N.htm|title=For Dave Clark Five, the accolades finally arrive |last=Gundersen|first=Edna|date=6 March 2008|access-date=13 July 2010|work=USA Today}}</ref> Although this was their only UK No. 1, they topped the US chart in December 1965, with their cover of [[Bobby Day]]'s "[[Over and Over (Bobby Day song)|Over and Over]]". Their other UK top-ten hits include "[[Bits and Pieces (song)|Bits and Pieces]]", "[[Can't You See That She's Mine]]", "[[Catch Us If You Can]]", "[[Everybody Knows (Dave Clark Five song)|Everybody Knows]]", "[[Callow-la-vita|The Red Balloon]]", "[[Good Old Rock 'n' Roll]]", and a version of [[Chet Powers]]' "[[Let's Get Together (Chet Powers song)|Get Together]]" (retitled as "Everybody Get Together").<ref>[http://musicvf.com/song.php?title=Everybody+Get+Together+by+The+Dave+Clark+Five&id=42326 The Dave Clark Five, "Everybody Get Together" chart position] Retrieved 18 May 2015</ref>

They were the second group of the [[British Invasion]] to appear on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the United States (for two weeks in March 1964 following [[The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show|the Beatles' three weeks]] the previous month). They would ultimately have 18 appearances on the show. The DC5 were one of the most commercially successful acts of the British Invasion, releasing seventeen top-40 hits in the US between 1964 and 1967, including several that did not chart as highly in the UK such as "[[Because (The Dave Clark Five song)|Because]]", "[[Do You Love Me]]", "Everybody Knows (I Still Love You)", "[[Any Way You Want It (Dave Clark Five song)|Any Way You Want It]]", "[[I Like It Like That (Chris Kenner song)|I Like It Like That]]", "Try Too Hard" and "[[You Got What It Takes]]". In 1965, the group starred in a [[feature film]] vehicle, ''[[Catch Us If You Can (film)|Catch Us If You Can]]'', directed by [[John Boorman]]. The group disbanded in early 1970, though Clark and a few former members continued as [[Dave Clark & Friends]] until 1973. In 2008, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=RNR>{{cite web |title=Inductees for 2008 |url=http://www.rockhall.com/pressroom/2008-inductee-announcement/ |work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame official website |date=13 December 2007 |access-date=11 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201220931/http://www.rockhall.com/pressroom/2008-inductee-announcement/ |archive-date=1 February 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Dave Clark Five 1966.JPG|thumb|''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in 1966. From left: Denis Payton, Dave Clark, Mike Smith, Rick Huxley and Lenny Davidson.]]
The band had its origins in 1958, as the backing musicians for [[north London]] vocalist Stan Saxon.<ref name="Larkin">{{Cite book |editor1-first=Colin |editor1-last=Larkin |editor1-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |year=2011 |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |edition=5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC |location=London |publisher=Omnibus Press |at=Clark, Dave, Five |isbn=9780857125958}}</ref> [[Dave Clark (musician)|Dave Clark]] played drums and contributed background vocals, alongside a frequently changing line-up.<ref name="Larkin" /> Clark and guitarist Rick Huxley both participated in the 1958 line-up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-21428486|title=Dave Clark Five bassist Huxley dies|date=12 February 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Clark and his bandmates eventually split with Saxon and reconstituted themselves as a standalone concern in January 1962, making their home in the South Grove Youth Club in [[Tottenham]], London.<ref name="Larkin" /> After a little more evolution, a lasting ensemble was settled, with Clark on drums, Huxley moving to bass, Lenny Davidson on lead guitar, Denis Payton on saxophone (and harmonica and rhythm guitar), and [[Mike Smith (Dave Clark Five)|Mike Smith]] on keyboards and lead vocals.<ref name="Larkin" /> Davidson's previous bands were the Off Beats and the Impalas.<ref name="SkidRock">{{cite web|url=http://www.skidmore.edu/~gthompso/britrock/60brchro/60brch40s.html |title=The Birth of a Nation |publisher=Skidmore.edu |access-date=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=rockhall/>

The DC5 was promoted as the vanguard of a "Tottenham Sound", a response to Liverpool's [[Mersey Beat]] sound,<ref name="Clark">{{Cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Dick |author-link1=Dick Clark |last2=Uslan |first2=Michael |last3=Solomon |first3=Bruce |year=1981 |title=Dick Clark's the First 25 Years of Rock & Roll |location=New York |publisher=Dell Publishing |page=[https://archive.org/details/dickclarksfirst200usla/page/n170 155] |isbn=044051763X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/dickclarksfirst200usla }}</ref> which featured an often loud and forceful production style driven by Clark's punchy drumming, Payton's saxophone padding and Smith's belting vocals. Dave Clark produced their recordings in collaboration with sound engineer [[Adrian Kerridge]] of [[Lansdowne Studios]], with production credited using the pseudonym Adrian Clark.<ref>Adrian Kerridge. 'The Dave Clark Five: History and Techniques', Ch. 9 of ''Tape's Rolling, Take One!'' (2016), pp. 169-186</ref> 

Dave Clark was also the group's manager, and struck business deals that allowed him to produce the band's recordings and gave him control of the master recordings.<ref>James E. Perone, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S5UbIgKdAS4C&q=dave+clark+five&pg=PA91 |title=Mods, Rockers, and the Music of the British Invasion |page=94 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2008 |isbn=978-0275998608 |access-date=13 July 2010 }}</ref> Songwriting credits for the band's original material went to Clark, or more often to the team of Clark and Smith.  Clark/Davidson and Clark/Payton compositions were also not uncommon.<ref>[http://www.richieunterberger.com/wordpress/tag/the-dave-clark-five/  Richie Unterberger, "The Dave Clark Five PBS Special... and Beyond", ''Folkrocks'', April 16, 2014].

The Dave Clark Five had 12 Top 40 hits in the UK between 1964 and 1967, and 17 records in the Top 40 of the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart. Their cover of [[Bobby Day]]'s "[[Over and Over (Bobby Day song)|Over and Over]]" went to No. 1 in the US on the [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1965 (USA)|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on Christmas Day 1965, despite less impressive sales in the UK (it peaked at No. 45 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]). They made 18 appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xQEAAAAMBAJ&q=dave+clark+five&pg=PA160 |title=A Second Wind, a New Generation |volume=19 |issue=12 |magazine=Orange Coast Magazine |issn=0279-0483  |access-date=13 July 2010 |date=December 1993 |author=Keith Tuber |page=160}}</ref> – more than any other [[British Invasion]] group.

The band released a film, ''[[Catch Us If You Can (film)|Catch Us If You Can]]'' (directed by [[John Boorman]]) in 1965. It starred [[Barbara Ferris]], and was released in the United States as ''Having a Wild Weekend''. The short film ''Hits in Action'' highlighted a series of Dave Clark Five hits.

Other than the songs "Live in the Sky", "Maze of Love", "Inside and Out", "The Red Balloon" and "Lost in His Dreams", the band did not follow the [[psychedelic music]] trend.<ref>James E. Perone, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S5UbIgKdAS4C&q=dave+clark+five&pg=PA91 |title=''Mods, rockers, and the music of the British invasion'' |page=99|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2008 |isbn=978-0275998608 |access-date=13 July 2010}}</ref> Their popularity in the US mostly dried up by 1967, though they continued to score hits in Britain for another three years. The Dave Clark Five disbanded in 1970, having had three singles on the UK chart that year, two of which reached the Top Ten. In 1970, Davidson, Huxley and Payton left, and Alan Parker and Eric Ford joined on lead guitar and bass. That line-up, renamed "Dave Clark & Friends", lasted until 1972.

==Post break-up==
Following the group's break-up, Clark set up a media company.  In the process, he acquired the rights to the 1960s pop series ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''. Additionally, he wrote and produced the 1986 London stage musical [[Time (musical)|''Time – The Musical'']] where he directed the last performance of Sir [[Laurence Olivier]]. A two-disc vinyl album was released in conjunction with the stage production featuring music recorded by [[Julian Lennon]] (singing DC5's song "[[Because (The Dave Clark Five song)|Because]]"), [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Ashford & Simpson]] and Olivier's selected dialogue. This double album was digitally remastered and released on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] in May 2012.

[[Mike Smith (Dave Clark Five)|Mike Smith]] teamed up with [[Mike d'Abo]] (previously with [[Manfred Mann]]) for one album in 1976. He also released a now-scarce CD in 2000 titled ''It's Only Rock & Roll'' and returned to performing in 2003 after a hiatus of 25 years. He formed Mike Smith's Rock Engine and did two mini-tours of the US He died on 28 February 2008 in a [[Buckinghamshire]] hospital from pneumonia, a complication of a paralysing spinal injury sustained from a fall in 2003.<ref name="Smith obit">{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7270242.stm |title=Dave Clark Five singer Smith dies |publisher=BBC |date=28 February 2008 |access-date=29 February 2008}}</ref>

Between 1978 and 1993, none of their music was available to be purchased in any commercial format due to rights-holder Clark declining to license the band's recordings. In 1993, a single CD ''Glad All Over Again'' was produced by Dave himself and released by EMI in Britain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,3700098,00.html |title=Glad All Over Again CD Edition by The Dave Clark Five @ ARTISTdirect.com – Shop, Listen, Download |publisher=Artistdirect.com |access-date=13 July 2010}}</ref> After a 1989 deal with the Disney Channel to rebroadcast the 1960s ITV show ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' (which Clark owned), he made a deal with Disney-owned [[Hollywood Records]] to issue in 1993 a double CD ''History of the Dave Clark Five''.<ref name=Huf>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harold-bronson/the-dave-clark-five-dave-_b_5091519.html |first=Harold |last=Bronson |date=4 April 2014 |work=Huffington Post |title=The Dave Clark Five: Dave Clark's Miscalculation}}</ref>  No DC5 material was then legally available until 2008, when the 28-track ''The Hits'' compilation was released by [[Universal Music]] in the UK. In 2009, selections from the band's catalogue were released on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]]. 

In 2014, Dave Clark wrote, produced, appeared in, and partly presented the television documentary ''The Dave Clark Five and Beyond: Glad All Over''.<ref>[http://www.richieunterberger.com/wordpress/tag/the-dave-clark-five/  Richie Unterberger, "The Dave Clark Five PBS Special... and Beyond", ''Folkrocks'', April 16, 2014].

In 2019, almost the entire catalogue from the band, including all the original 1960s studio albums, became available on [[Spotify]] for the first time.  On 24 January 2020, [[BMG Rights Management]], with whom Clark has recently joined forces to reissue the band's recordings, released a new DC5 greatest hits CD (titled ''All the Hits'', and which was based on the 2008 ''The Hits'' compilation) in two configurations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bestclassicbands.com/dave-clark-five-hits-collection-bmg-12-3-19/|title=Dave Clark Five 'All the Hits' Collection Coming: Listen|website=Bestclassicbands.com|date=30 July 2017|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref>

==Induction into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame==
The Dave Clark Five made the list of nominees for the class of 2008, and on 13 December 2007 it was announced that the band would be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on 10 March 2008.<ref name="RNR" /> The group was inducted by [[Tom Hanks]], who wrote, directed and starred in the 1996 film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]'', which was about an American one-hit wonder band that became popular in the wake of the British Invasion.

In attendance with the three surviving members of the DC5 were the families of Lenny Davidson and Rick Huxley, and Denis Payton's two sons. Mike Smith had planned on attending but died 11 days before the induction. Dave Clark opened up his acceptance speech by saying that he felt like he was at the [[Academy Award|Oscars]]. Davidson mentioned that they arrived in New York City for the ceremony on 8 March, exactly 44 years after the group's first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.

[[Joan Jett]] honoured the Dave Clark Five by performing "Bits and Pieces" with John Mellencamp's band. To perform "Glad All Over", Jett was joined by [[John Fogerty]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Billy Joel]] and other artists who performed throughout the evening.
