'''Tesla''' is an American [[hard rock]] band from [[Sacramento, California]]. In late 1981, bassist Brian Wheat and guitarist Frank Hannon formed a band named City Kidd, which evolved into Tesla.<ref name="Energy">{{Citation | at = Sec.

The band adopted the Tesla moniker shortly before recording their first album, as another band with a name similar to City Kidd already existed.

Tesla rose to fame during the [[Glam metal|hair metal]] boom of the 1980s.<ref name=":0" /> Their debut album, ''[[Mechanical Resonance (album)|Mechanical Resonance]]'', was released in 1986, which produced two hit singles, "[[Modern Day Cowboy]]" and their cover of "[[Little Suzi]]" (originally by [[Ph.D. (band)|Ph.D.]]). The band's second album, ''[[The Great Radio Controversy]]'' (1989), peaked at {{abbr|No.|Number}}{{sp}}18 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart and produced the top-ten single "[[Love Song (Tesla song)|Love Song]]". The band recorded and released their third album, the live acoustic album ''[[Five Man Acoustical Jam]]'', in 1990. It peaked at No.{{sp}}12 on the ''Billboard 200'' and produced their top-charting single (No.{{sp}}8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]), "[[Signs (Five Man Electrical Band song)|Signs]]", a cover of a song by the [[Five Man Electrical Band]]. Their third studio album, ''[[Psychotic Supper]]'' (1991), peaked at No.{{sp}}13, but lacked a hit single; similarly their next album, 1994's ''[[Bust a Nut]]'' did well enough on the album charts, peaking at No.{{sp}}20, but also lacked any radio hits. 

The band broke up in 1996, but returned in 2000 with a live tour and album, both named ''[[Replugged Live|Replugged]]''. They have continued to record and tour, though Skeoch left in 2006 and was replaced by Dave Rude on guitars. Their most recent release is the EP ''All About Love'' (2024), while their latest studio album to date is ''[[Shock (Tesla album)|Shock]]'' (2019). Tesla have sold at least 14 million albums in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|title=After 30 years, Tesla adopts an edgier rock sound|url=https://www.toledoblade.com/a-e/music-theater-dance/2016/10/06/Rolling-forward-After-30-years-Tesla-adopts-an-edgier-rock-sound/stories/20161006094|access-date=March 1, 2021|website=The Blade|quote=Tesla has sold more than 14 million albums in the United States}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and ''Mechanical Resonance'' (1981–1988)===
The band City Kidd was renamed Tesla during the recording of their first album, 1986's ''[[Mechanical Resonance (album)|Mechanical Resonance]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=445}}</ref> on the advice of their manager that City Kidd was not a great name (in addition, there was already another band going by that name). The band derived their name, certain album and song titles, and some song content from events relating to inventor and electrical engineer [[Nikola Tesla]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Along with the band's next two studio albums, ''Mechanical Resonance'' was produced by [[Michael Barbiero]] and [[Steve Thompson (musician)|Steve Thompson]].

The band's original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jeff Keith, guitarists Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch, bassist Brian Wheat, and drummer Robert Contreras, who was soon replaced by ex-[[Eric Martin (American singer)|Eric Martin Band]] drummer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/cult-heroes-tesla-the-ultimate-blue-collar-rockers|title=Cult Heroes: Tesla, the ultimate blue collar rockers|first=Dave |last=Ling|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en|access-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref> Troy Luccketta.

In the early days of their career, Tesla toured with [[David Lee Roth]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Def Leppard]], and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], which resulted in the band being categorized as a glam metal band. The band's members resented this labeling.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=21166 TESLA Bassist: Don't Call Us A Glam Band – Apr. 7, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001005402/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=21166 |date=October 1, 2007 }} – BLABBERMOUTH.COM</ref><ref>[http://knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=4884 Dab Rao Tracks Down Tesla Frontman Jeff Keith] – Tesla Interview – KNAC.COM</ref> The band, according to Troy Luccketta, now does not mind being labeled as a part of that scene.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Alex|last=Distefano|title=Tesla's Hair Metal Sound Still Resonates – OC Weekly|date=September 24, 2018|url=https://www.ocweekly.com/teslas-atypical-hair-metal-sound-still-resonates/|access-date=March 2, 2021|website=www.ocweekly.com}}</ref>

===''The Great Radio Controversy'' and ''Psychotic Supper'' (1989–1993)===
The band released their second album, ''[[The Great Radio Controversy]]'', in 1989.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The album helped solidify the band's growing reputation and fan base, and produced five hit singles, including the power ballad "[[Love Song (Tesla song)|Love Song]]".<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

In 1990, Tesla released ''[[Five Man Acoustical Jam]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> a live album featuring acoustic renditions of hits such as "Comin' Atcha Live", "Gettin' Better", "Modern Day Cowboy", and "Love Song". The album also featured a number of covers, most notably a version of "[[Signs (Five Man Electrical Band song)|Signs]]", a 1971 hit by the [[Five Man Electrical Band]].

In 1991, the band released their third studio album ''[[Psychotic Supper]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The band itself considers this to be their best album according to their official web site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teslatheband.com/|title=Tesla the Band &#124; Official Website &#124; American Made Rock 'n' Roll|website=eslatheband.com|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref> The 1998 Japanese reissue import of ''Psychotic Supper'' contains one previously unreleased song, "Rock the Nation", as well as the songs "I Ain't Superstitious", and "Run Run Run", both of which had only been previously available as B-sides to two singles from ''[[The Great Radio Controversy]]''.

===''Bust a Nut'' and hiatus (1994–1996)===
In 1994, the band released their fourth studio album, ''[[Bust a Nut]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The Japanese edition of ''Bust a Nut'' contained the previously unreleased cover of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[The Ocean (Led Zeppelin song)|The Ocean]]".

After the release of ''Bust a Nut'', Skeoch departed because of his struggle with substance abuse. He rejoined after completing rehab, only to depart again months later. The band moved forward as a four-piece for a short while. However, it wasn't long before Skeoch briefly joined up with solo artist Marshall Coleman's band to support his solo career, only to see a departure of Marshall soon after. This band eventually morphed to include Jeff Keith and resurfaced as [[Bar 7]] with a single "Four Leaf Clover", from the album ''The World Is a Freak''. Brian Wheat formed Soulmotor and Frank Hannon formed Moon Dog Mane, while Troy Luccketta worked with several local artists including the Bay Area's One Thin Dime.

===Reunion, ''Into the Now'' and ''Real to Reel'' (2000–2007)===
After a break of six years, the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' reported that the band had reformed in 2000 with the help of local radio personality Pat Martin of KRXQ. The band played a sold-out show at [[ARCO Arena]] in Sacramento on October 25, 2000. Soon after they recorded the double live album ''[[Replugged Live]]''. In 2002 they were featured in the [[Rock Never Stops Tour]] alongside other 1980s rock bands.

2002 saw the release of a further live album, ''[[Standing Room Only (Tesla album)|Standing Room Only]]'', which is just a single CD version of ''Replugged Live''.

In 2004, they released their fifth studio album ''[[Into the Now]]'' which debuted on the Billboard album chart at No. 30. The album was well received by fans and the band was featured on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''

In the summer of 2006, the band embarked on the Electric Summer Jam Tour without guitarist Tommy Skeoch, who had left the band indefinitely to spend time with his family, and, as he later revealed on ''The Classic Metal Show'', other reasons; particularly his continuing problems with substance abuse.<ref name="BukszpanDio2003">{{cite book|last1=Bukszpan|first1=Daniel|last2=Dio|first2=Ronnie James|title=The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YaDDsg0H35gC&pg=PT239|access-date=August 12, 2011|date=October 1, 2003|publisher=Barnes & Noble Publishing|isbn=978-0-7607-4218-1|pages=239–}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nqkaAAAAIBAJ&pg=2335,3284144&dq=tommy+skeoch+drug&hl=en|title=Rockers Tesla keeps on Steppin'|last=Maples|first=Tina|date=January 18, 1996|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|access-date=August 12, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=August 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Scott Johnson of the Sacramento band Rogue filled in for a time on this tour. Eventually Dave Rude replaced Skeoch permanently.

Tesla recorded a two-volume collection of cover songs titled ''[[Real to Reel (Tesla album)|Real to Reel]]'', which was released on June 5, 2007. The recording is available as a two-CD set. The first CD (containing 13 songs) is sold in a case with a blank slot for the second CD. The second CD (containing 12 additional songs) was initially available to concert goers in the US at no additional charge beyond the cost of a ticket. The second CD was also given away with the August edition of [[Classic Rock magazine|''Classic Rock'' magazine]] in Europe.

At the end of August, Tesla announced their first world tour in 16 years with dates in Australia, Japan, and Europe in October and November 2007.

===''Forever More'' and ''Twisted Wires'' (2008–2012)===
[[File:Tesla Sweden Rock 2008.jpg|thumb|Tesla at [[Sweden Rock Festival]] 2008]]
In June and July 2008, Tesla played a few shows in Europe and the US, including [[Sweden Rock Festival]], [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and [[Rocklahoma]]. On July 15, 2008, "Tesla- Comin' Atcha Live! 2008" was released from a live concert filmed February 22, 2008 at the sold out Myth Nightclub in Maplewood, Minnesota. The two-hour show included hits "Modern Day Cowboy", "Love Song" and "Song and Emotion" along with additional backstage footage.

On August 11, 2008, it was reported that Tesla's next album, entitled ''[[Forever More (album)|Forever More]]'', would be released on October 7 on their own record label, Tesla Electric Company Recordings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=38297|title=Tesla Announces New Album Release Date|website=Metalunderground.com|access-date=August 11, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=102589 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - TESLA To Release 'Forever More' In October |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=August 11, 2008 |access-date=August 11, 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120914142539/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=102589  |archive-date=September 14, 2012}}</ref> The album was produced by Terry Thomas, who produced ''Bust a Nut''. The band aired the album's first single, "I Wanna Live" on radio stations across the globe on August 18 and kicked off a world tour on October 1. Forever More debuted No. 33 on The Billboard 200 chart and spawned singles "I Wanna Live", "Fallin' Apart" and "Breakin' Free".

On May 10, 2011, the band played at a rally for the [[Sacramento Kings]] of the [[NBA]]. Tesla performed two songs, "Signs" and "Love Song" during the Kings #HereWeRally at Cesar Chavez Park in Sacramento, California to celebrate the team staying in Sacramento for at least one more year.

On July 25, 2011, they released a mostly acoustic album titled ''Twisted Wires and the Acoustic Sessions''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=159859 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910211827/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=159859 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 10, 2012 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - TESLA: 'Twisted Wires And The Acoustic Sessions' European Release Date Announced |date=June 24, 2011|website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=March 29, 2012}}</ref>

==Charity work==
While promoting their album ''[[The Great Radio Controversy]]'', the band participated in a canned food drive that allowed free concert admission to contributors, this event was incorporated into the video for "The Way It Is".
In February 2005, Tesla headlined a benefit show at the PPAC in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], for the victims of [[the Station nightclub fire]]. During the show the band auctioned off an autographed acoustic guitar, with the proceeds going to the Station Family Fund. 100% of the ticket sales also went to this charity.<ref>{{cite web |title=TESLA To Headline STATION FAMILY FUND Benefit Concert|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/tesla-to-headline-station-family-fund-benefit-concert/|website= Blabbermouth.net |date= January 13, 2005}}</ref>

In February 2008, Tesla helped fund and headlined a benefit concert for victims of the Station nightclub fire. The show was broadcast by [[VH1 Classic]]. Tesla played three songs: "What You Give", "Signs", and "Love Song", though "What You Give" did not make it onto the broadcast.<ref>{{cite web |title=VH1 News: Station Family Fund |url= http://www.vh1.com/video/misc/218014/vh1-news-station-family-fund.jhtml|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110208121651/http://www.vh1.com/video/misc/218014/vh1-news-station-family-fund.jhtml|url-status= dead|archive-date= February 8, 2011|work= [[VH1]] |date= March 21, 2008}}</ref>
