    "What's that?",

    "Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages",
    "around the two hapless robots.",
    "Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?",
    "At last! Where have you been?",
    "Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.",
    "They're heading in this direction.",
    "What are we going to do? We'll be",
    "sent to the spice mine of Kessel or",
    "smashed into who knows what!",
    "Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the",
    "subhallway. Threepio chases after him.",
    "Wait a minute, where are you going?",
    "Artoo responds with electronic beeps.",
    "Hey, you're not permitted in there.",
    "It's restricted. You'll be deactivated",
    "for sure..",
    "Artoo beeps something to him.",
    "Don't call me a mindless philosopher,",
    "you overweight glob of grease! Now",
    "come out before somebody sees you.",
    "Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding",
    "the mission he is about to perform.",
    "Secret mission? What plans? What are",
    "you talking about? I'm not getting",
    "in there!",
    "Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps",
    "and twangs angrily.",
    "I'm going to regret this.",
    "That's funny, the damage doesn't",
    "look as bad from out here.",
    "Artoo beeps an assuring response.",
    "Are you sure this things safe?",
    "How did I get into this mess? I really",
    "I've got to rest before I fall apart.",
    "My joints are almost frozen.",
    "What a desolate place this is.",
    "Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts",
    "off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio",
    "stops and yells at him.",
    "Where are you going?",
    "Well, I'm not going that way. It's",
    "much too rocky. This way is much",
    "easier.",
    "Artoo counters with a long whistle.",
    "What makes you think there are",
    "settlements over there?",
    "Don't get technical with me.",
    "What mission? What are you talking",
    "about? I've had just about enough of",
    "you! Go that way! You'll be",
    "malfunctioning within a day, you",
    "nearsighted scrap pile!",
    "And don't let me catch you following",
    "me begging for help, because you",
    "won't get it.",
    "Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges",
    "off in the direction of the towering mesas.",
    "No more adventures. I'm not going",
    "that way.",
    "Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant",
    "mountains.",
    "That malfunctioning little twerp.",
    "This is all his fault! He tricked me",
    "into going this way, but he'll do no",
    "better.",
    "In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand",
    "Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm",
    "saved!",
    "Over here! Help! Please, help!",
    "Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!",
    "Wake up! Wake up!",
    "Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,",
    "creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.",
    "Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights",
    "pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long",
    "chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding",
    "white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the",
    "odd assortment of robots.",
    "We're doomed.",
    "A Jawa starts moving toward them.",
    "Do you think they'll melt us down?",
    "Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.",
    "Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this",
    "never end?",

    "Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was",
    "programming binary load lifter...",
    "very similar to your vaporators. You",
    "could say...",
    "Of course I can, sir. It's like a",
    "second language for me... I'm as",
    "fluent in Bocce...",
    "Shutting up, sir.",
    "Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is",
    "in prime condition. A real bargain.",
    "Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very",
    "pleased with that one, sir. He really",
    "is in first-class condition. I've",
    "worked with him before. Here he comes.",
    "Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots",
    "trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.",
    "Now, don't you forget this! Why I",
    "should stick my neck out for you is",
    "quite beyond my capacity!",
    "Thank the maker! This oil bath is",
    "going to feel so good. I've got such",
    "a bad case of dust contamination, I",
    "can barely move!",
    "Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought",
    "as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man",
    "Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage.",
    "Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he",
    "slams a wrench across the workbench.",
    "Is there anything I might do to help?",
    "Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains",
    "and a tiny smile creeps across his face.",
    "I don't think so, sir. I'm only a",
    "droid and not very knowledgeable",
    "about such things. Not on this planet,",
    "anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm",
    "not even sure which planet I'm on.",
    "I see, sir.",
    "I see, sir Luke.",
    "And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg",

    "With all we've been through, sometimes",
    "I'm amazed we're in as good condition",

    "and all.",
    "That's how we came to be in your",
    "service, if you take my meaning,",
    "sir.",
    "Several, I think. Actually, there's",
    "not much to tell. I'm not much more",
    "than an interpreter, and not very",
    "good at telling stories. Well, not",
    "at making them interesting, anyways.",
    "Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's",
    "neck joint. He uses a larger pick.",
    "What is what?!? He asked you a",
    "question...",
    "What is that?",
    "Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice",
    "the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer",
    "for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the",
    "sentence fragment over and over.",
    "Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely",
    "a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no",
    "mind.",
    "Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.",
    "I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.",
    "I think she was a passenger on our",
    "last voyage. A person of some",
    "importance, sir -- I believe. Our",
    "captain was attached to...",
    "Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going",
    "to get us in trouble. It's all right,",
    "you can trust him. He's our new",
    "master.",
    "Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.",
    "He says he's the property of Obi-Wan",
    "Kenobi, a resident of these parts.",
    "And it's a private message for him.",
    "Quite frankly, sir I don't know what",
    "he's talking about. Our last master",
    "was Captain Antilles, but with what",
    "we've been through, this little R2",
    "unit has become a bit eccentric.",
    "I beg your pardon, sir, but do you",
    "know what he's talking about?",
    "He says the restraining bolt has",
    "short circuited his recording system.",
    "He suggests that if you remove the",
    "bolt, he might be able to play back",
    "the entire recording.",
    "What message? The one you're carrying",
    "inside your rusty innards!",
    "I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to",
    "have picked up a slight flutter.",
    "Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and",
    "hurries out of the room.",
    "Just you reconsider playing that",
    "message for him.",
    "Artoo beeps in response.",
    "No, I don't think he likes you at",
    "all.",
    "Artoo beeps.",
    "No, I don't like you either.",
    "It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't",
    "deactivate me. I told him not to go,",
    "but he's faulty, malfunctioning;",
    "kept babbling on about his mission.",
    "That R2 unit has always been a",
    "problem. These astro-droids are",
    "getting quite out of hand. Even I",
    "can't understand their logic at times.",
    "Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go",
    "after him?",
    "Oh, he excels at that, sir.",
    "Sir, would it help if you told him",
    "it was my fault.",
    "Deactivate! Well, on the other hand",
    "if you hadn't removed his restraining",
    "bolt...",
    "Master Luke here is your rightful",
    "owner. We'll have no more of this",
    "Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't",
    "talk to me about your mission, either.",
    "You're fortunate he doesn't blast",
    "you into a million pieces right here.",
    "If you don't mind my saying so, sir,",
    "I think you should deactivate the",
    "little fugitive until you've gotten",
    "him back to your workshop.",
    "Oh my... sir, he says there are",
    "several creatures approaching from",
    "the southeast.",
    "Where am I? I must have taken a bad",
    "step...",
    "I don't think I can make it. You go",
    "on, Master Luke. There's no sense in",
    "you risking yourself on my account.",
    "I'm done for.",
    "Artoo makes a beeping sound.",
    "Sir, if you'll not be needing me,",
    "I'll close down for awhile.",
    "I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting",
    "creatures.",
    "As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa",
    "away.",
    "Come along, Artoo.",
    "I heartily agree with you sir.",
    "Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the",
    "creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.",
    "I don't like the look of this.",
    "Lock the door, Artoo.",
    "One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves",
    "on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and",
    "Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.",
    "I would much rather have gone with",
    "You watch your language!",
    "Hello, sir.",
    "Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I",
    "hate space travel.",
    "Now be careful, Artoo.",
    "Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his",
    "stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures",
    "to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's",
    "face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.",
    "Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and",
    "begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.",
    "He made a fair move. Screaming about",
    "it won't help you.",
    "But sir, nobody worries about",
    "upsetting a droid.",
    "I see your point, sir. I suggest a",
    "new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee",
    "win.",
    "We found the computer outlet, sir.",
    "Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of",
    "the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it",
    "carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.",
    "Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.",
    "He says he's found the main computer",
    "to power the tractor beam that's",
    "holding the ship here. He'll try to",
    "make the precise location appear on",
    "the monitor.",
    "I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.",
    "He says \"I found her\", and keeps",
    "repeating, \"She's here.\"",
    "Princess Leia.",
    "Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-",
    "three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to",
    "be terminated.",
    "Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for",
    "asking... but, ah... what should",
    "Artoo and I do if we're discovered",
    "here?",
    "That isn't very reassuring.",
    "Yes sir?",
    "I said, all systems have been alerted",
    "to your presence, sir. The main",
    "entrance seems to be the only way in",
    "or out; all other information on",
    "your level is restricted.",
    "Oh, no!",
    "They're madmen! They're heading for",
    "the prison level. If you hurry, you",
    "might catch them.",
    "Come on!",
    "Oh! All this excitement has overrun",
    "the circuits of my counterpart here.",
    "If you don't mind, I'd like to take",
    "him down to maintenance.",
    "They aren't here! Something must",
    "have happened to them. See if they've",
    "been captured.",
    "Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall",
    "socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from",
    "the tiny robot.",
    "Hurry!",
    "Thank goodness, they haven't found",
    "them! Where could they be?",
    "Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.",
    "Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I",
    "turned it off!",
    "Are you there, sir?",
    "We've had some problems...",
    "No. Shut them all down! Hurry!",
    "Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo!",
    "Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast",
    "enough. It's all my fault! My poor",
    "master!",
    "For the moment. Uh, we're in the",
    "main hangar across from the ship.",
    "Where could they be?",
    "Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left",
    "and right, beeping a response.",
    "Come on, Artoo, we're going!",
    "Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who",
    "were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards",
    "Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.",
    "Oooh!",
    "Help! I think I'm melting!",
    "This is all your fault.",
    "Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to",
    "come back.",
    "Artoo beeps in agreement.",
    "You wouldn't want my life to get",
    "boring, would you?",
    "Artoo whistles his reply.",
    "All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.",
    "Hang on, Artoo!",
    "Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say",
    "something!",
    "You can repair him, can't you?",
    "You must repair him! Sir, if any of",
    "my circuits or gears will help, I'll",
    "gladly donate them.",
    "Don't try to blame me.  I didn't",
    "ask you to turn on the thermal",
    "heater.  I merely commented that it",
    "was freezing in the princess'",
    "chamber.  But it's supposed to be",
    "freezing.  How are we going to dry",
    "out all her clothes?  I really don't",
    "know.",
    "Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.",
    "Oh, switch off.",
    "Excuse me, sir.",
    "Might I have a word with you,",
    "please?",
    "Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.",
    "She's been trying to get you on",
    "the communicator.",
    "Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering",
    "about Master Luke.  He hasn't come",
    "back yet.  She doesn't know where he",
    "is.",
    "Nobody knows where he is.",
    "Well, uh, you see...",
    "Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...",
    "Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer",
    "approaches.",
    "Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire",
    "what's going on?",
    "Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo,",
    "let's find Princess Leia.  Between",
    "ourselves, I think Master Luke is",
    "in considerable danger.",
    "You must come along now, Artoo.",
    "There's really nothing more we can",
    "do.  And my joints are freezing up.",
    "Artoo beeps, long and low.",
    "Don't say thing like that!  Of",
    "course we'll see Master Luke again.",
    "He'll be quite all right, you'll see.",
    "Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll",
    "be quite all right.",
    "Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been",
    "quite unable to pick up any signals,",
    "although he does admit that his own",
    "range is far too weak to abandon",
    "all hope.",
    "Artoo says the chances of survival",
    "are seven hundred seventy-five...",
    "to one.",
    "Actually, Artoo has been known to",
    "make mistakes... from time to time.",
    "Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry",
    "about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll",
    "be all right.  He's quite clever,",
    "you know... for a human being.",
    "Master Luke, sir, it's so good",
    "to see you fully functional again.",
    "Artoo beeps his good wishes.",
    "Artoo expresses his relief, also.",
    "Excuse us, please.",
    "Sir, I am fluent in six million",
    "forms of communication.  This signal",
    "is not used by the Alliance.  It",
    "could be an Imperial code.",
    "Artoo, you take good care of",
    "Master Luke now, understand?  And",
    "... do take good care of yourself.",
    "Oh, dear, oh, dear.",
    "Your Highness, we must take this",
    "last transport.  It's our only hope.",
    "Oh!  Wait for me!",
    "But... but... but... where are",
    "you going?  Uh... come back!!",
    "Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!",
    "How typical.",
    "Quickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the golden droid",
    "through.",
    "Wait!  Wait!",
    "Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir,",
    "might I suggest that you...",
    "It can wait.",
    "Sir, sir!  Might I suggest...",
    "But, sir!",
    "If I may say so, sir, I noticed",
    "earlier that the hyperdrive",
    "motivator has been damaged.  It's",
    "impossible to go to light-speed!",
    "Sir, the possibility of successfully",
    "navigating an asteroid field is",
    "approximately three thousand, seven",
    "hundred and twenty to one.",
    "Pulverized?",
    "Closer?!",
    "Chewbacca barks the same word, only louder.",
    "Oh, this is suicide!",
    "Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful",
    "Wookiee, pointing.",
    "Excuse me, ma'am, but where are",
    "we going?",
    "Out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of",
    "the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.",
    "Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,",
    "but... does that include shutting",
    "me down, too?",
    "Sir, it's quite possible this",
    "asteroid is not entirely stable.",
    "Oh!  Sometimes I just don't",
    "understand human behavior.  After",
    "all, I'm only trying to do my job",
    "in the most...",
    "Oh, where is Artoo when I need",
    "him?",
    "Sir, I don't know where your ship",
    "learned to communicate, but it",
    "has the most peculiar dialect.  I",
    "believe, sir, it says that the",
    "power coupling on the negative",
    "axis has been polarized.  I'm",
    "afraid you'll have to replace it.",
    "Sir, sir!  I've isolated the",
    "reverse power flux coupling.",
    "Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.",
    "Sir, if I may venture an opinion...",
    "There it is.  Listen!  Listen!",
    "I think it might be better if I",
    "stay here and guard the ship.",
    "(hears another",
    "mysterious noise)",
    "Oh, no.",
    "Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly",
    "little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!",
    "Look!",
    "We're doomed!",
    "Oh, thank goodness we're coming",
    "out of the asteroid field.",
    "Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside.  A",
    "bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side",
    "of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side.",
    "Sir, we just lost the main rear",
    "deflector shield.  One more direct",
    "hit on the back quarter and we're",
    "done for.",
    "Han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever.",
    "Sir, the odds of surviving a",
    "direct assault on an Imperial",
    "Star Destroyer...",
    "Captain Solo, this time you have",
    "gone too far.",
    "No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.",
    "Why doesn't anyone listen to me?",
    "I really don't see how that is",
    "going to help.  Surrender is a",
    "perfectly acceptable alternative",
    "in extreme circumstances.  The",
    "Empire may be gracious enough...",
    "Rather touchy, aren't they?",
    "Oh.  No one to meet us.",
    "Well, they did let us land.",
    "Well, he seems very friendly.",
    "Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio,",
    "human-cyborg relations.  My",
    "facilities are at your...",
    "Before Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has turned to",
    "Well, really!",
    "Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.",
    "How rude!",
    "Threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away.  Then he hears the",
    "muffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit coming from within the",
    "room.",
    "That sounds like an R2 unit in",
    "there.  I wonder if...",
    "Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my.",
    "Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I",
    "didn't mean to intrude.  No, no,",
    "please don't get up.  No!",
    "Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take",
    "this off!  I, uh, don't mean to",
    "intrude here.  I, don't, no, no,",
    "no... Please don't get up.  No!",

    "danger.  I must tell the others.",
    "Oh, no!  I've been shot!",
    "Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like",
    "that.  Oh!  Something's not right",
    "because now I can't see.  Wait.",
    "Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?",
    "I'm backwards, you stupid furball.",
    "Only an overgrown mophead like you",
    "would be stupid enough...",
    "Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a",
    "circuit and the droid shuts down.  The Wookiee smells something and",
    "sits up.  The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is",

    "air.",
    "No, my father didn't fight in the",

    "You fought in the Clone Wars?",
    "I wish I'd known him.",
    "Sure, go ahead.",
    "What is it?",
    "How did my father die?",
    "The Force?",
    "I saw part of the message he was...",

    "such a long way from here.",
    "Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever",
    "going to explain this?",
    "Look, I can take you as far as",
    "Anchorhead. You can get a transport",
    "there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're",
    "going.",
    "These are the same Jawas that sold",
    "us Artoo and Threepio.",
    "Why would Imperial troops want to",
    "slaughter Jawas?",
    "If they traced the robots here, they",
    "may have learned who they sold them",
    "to. And that would lead them home!",
    "Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!",
    "Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle.",

    "stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new",

    "I want to come with you to Alderaan.",

    "About three or four seasons.",

    "Alderaan?",
    "I'm ready for anything.",
    "What?",
    "Listen, why don't you wait out by",

    "into the detention block?",

    "Well more wealth that you can imagine.",
    "You'll get it!",
    "You will...",
    "All right.",
    "Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders",
    "there will you?",
    "Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on",
    "you.",

    "There isn't any other way out.",

    "Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The",
    "laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.",
    "Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes",

    "rather grim look on her face.",
    "Will you forget it? I already tried",
    "it. It's magnetically sealed!",
    "There's something alive in here!",

    "Anywhere! Oh!!",

    "where are we?",
    "Well, let's get moving!",
    "See-Threepio, do you copy?",
    "We're right above you. Stand by.",
    "Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of",
    "Where are you going? Come back!",
    "What good will it do us if he gets",
    "himself killed? Come on!",

    "I think we took a wrong turn.",

    "I care!",
    "So... what do you think of her, Han?",
    "Good...",
    "No!",
    "It's not impossible. I used to bull's-",
    "eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back",
    "home. They're not much bigger than",
    "two meters.",
    "So... you got your reward and you're",
    "just leaving then?",
    "Come on! Why don't you take a look",
    "around? You know what's about to",
    "happen, what they're up against.",
    "They could use a good pilot like",
    "you. You're turning your back on",
    "them.",
    "All right. Well, take care of",
    "yourself, Han. I guess that's what",
    "you're best at, isn't it?",
    "Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really",
    "thought he'd change his mind.",
    "I only wish Ben were here.",

    "You okay, Artoo?",
    "Red Five standing by.",
    "This is Red Five; I'm going in!",

    "anything.",
    "Got him!",

    "No sign of any... wait!",
    "Red Leader, we're right above you.",
    "Turn to point...",
    "...oh-five; we'll cover for you.",
    "It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon",
    "back home.",
    "Watch yourself! Increase speed full",
    "throttle!",
    "You worry about those fighters! I'll",
    "worry about the tower!",
    "Artoo... that, that stabilizer's",
    "broken loose again! See if you can't",

    "Get clear, Wedge.",
    "You can't do any more good back there!",

    "After a little static a familiar voice is heard.",
    "Well, I finished my circle.  I",
    "don't pick up any life readings.",
    "Right.  I'll see you shortly.",

    "it out.  It won't take long.",
    "Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.",
    "He pats the beast on the head to calm it.",

    "Aaargh!",
    "Ben?",
    "Dagobah system?",
    "Ben... Ben.",
    "Luke drops into unconsciousness.",
    "Ben... Ben...",
    "Dagobah system...",
    "Dagobah...",
    "Yoda...",
    "Thanks to you.",
    "Well, forget the heavy equipment.",
    "There's plenty of time to get the",
    "smaller modules on the transports.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Chewie, take care of yourself,",
    "okay?",
    "Yeah.",
    "You, too.",
    "Luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on.  After a few steps,",
    "he stops and looks back.  Han glances up and the two exchange a silent",
    "communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things,",
    "all difficult to verbalize.",
    "Just like new, Dack.  How about",
    "you?",
    "(quietly, strapping",
    "in)",
    "I know what you mean.",
    "Echo station Five-Seven.  We're",
    "on our way.",
    "All right, boys, keep tight now.",
    "Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern",
    "delta.  Go now!",
    "All right, I'm coming in.",
    "Hobbie, you still with me?",
    "That armor's too strong for",
    "blasters.",
    "On the horizon, another walker moves up past Luke's cockpit window,",
    "twisting out of sight as Luke banks and starts another run.",
    "Rogue Group, use your harpoons",
    "and tow cables.  Go for the legs.",
    "It might be our only chance of",
    "stopping them.",
    "All right, stand by, Dack.",
    "Dack is at the gunner's controls.",
    "Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get",
    "ready to fire that tow cable.",
    "Barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, Dack struggles to set up",
    "his harpoon gun.",
    "Dack?  Dack!",
    "Dack is lost.  Blood streams down his forehead, which rests on his",
    "smoldering controls.  Out the back window, an Imperial walker recedes",
    "in the distance.",
    "Rogue Three.",
    "Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll",
    "have to make this shot.  I'll cover",
    "for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow",
    "Steady, Rogue Two",
    "I see it, Wedge.  Good work.",
    "Rogue Two, are you all right?",
    "We'll set harpoon.  I'll cover for you.",
    "Watch that cross fire, boys.",
    "Stay tight and low.",
    "Hobbie, I've been hit!",
    "Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.",
    "Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going,",
    "we're going.",
    "There's nothing wrong, Artoo.",
    "I'm just setting a new course.",
    "Artoo beeps once again.",
    "We're not going to regroup with",
    "the others.",
    "We're going to the Dagobah system.",
    "Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments.  He rides along",
    "with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence.",
    "Finally, Artoo chirps up.",
    "Yes, Artoo?",
    "Artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.",
    "That's all right.  I'd like to",
    "keep it on manual control for a",
    "while.",
    "Yes, that's it.  Dagobah.",
    "Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.",
    "No, I'm not going to change my",
    "mind about this.",
    "I'm not picking up any cities or",
    "technology.  Massive life-form",
    "readings, though.  There's something",
    "alive down there...",
    "Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.",
    "Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe",
    "for droids.",
    "I know, I know!  All the scopes are",
    "dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just",
    "hang on, I'm going to start the",
    "landing cycle...",
    "No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll",
    "have a look around.",
    "Artoo lets out a short beep.  As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses",
    "his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.",
    "Artoo?",
    "Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water",
    "is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.",
    "Artoo!  Where are you?",
    "Artoo!  You be more careful.",
    "Artoo - that way!",
    "Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving",
    "toward the little droid.  The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the",
    "swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.  The",
    "droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.",
    "Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into",
    "the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.",
    "Artoo!",
    "Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come",
    "on.  You're lucky you don't taste",
    "very good.  Anything broken?",
    "Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from",
    "his round metal body.  Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.",
    "If you're saying coming here was",
    "a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree",
    "with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we",
    "doing here?  It's like... something",
    "out of a dream, or, I don't know.",
    "Maybe I'm just going crazy.",
    "As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him,",
    "Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.",
    "Ready for some power?  Okay.",
    "Let's see now.  Put that in",
    "there.  There you go.",
    "Now all I have to do is find this",
    "Yoda... if he even exists.",
    "Still... there's something familiar",
    "about this place.  I feel like...",
    "I don't know...",
    "(looking at the",
    "creature)",
    "Like we're being watched!",
    "I'm looking for someone.",
    "(Trying to keep from",
    "smiling)",
    "Right.",
    "I don't think so.  I'm looking",
    "for a great warrior.",
    "Put that down.  Hey!  That's my",
    "dinner!",
    "Listen, friend, we didn't mean to",
    "land in that puddle, and if we",
    "could get our ship out, we would,",
    "but we can't, so why don't you just...",
    "Hey, you could have broken this.",
    "Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're",
    "making a mess.  Hey, give me that!",
    "I don't want your help.  I want",
    "my lamp back.  I'll need it to",
    "get out of this slimy mudhole.",
    "Oh, Artoo, let him have it!",
    "Artoo!",
    "Now will you move along, little",
    "fella?  We're got a lot of work",
    "to do.",
    "I'm not looking for a friend.",
    "I'm looking for a Jedi Master.",
    "You know him?",
    "Stay here and watch after the",
    "camp, Artoo.",
    "Artoo beeps even more frantically.  But as Luke disappears from view,",
    "the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic",
    "sigh.",
    "Look, I'm sure it's delicious.",
    "I just don't understand why we",
    "can't see Yoda now.",
    "How far away is Yoda?  Will it",
    "take us long to get there?",
    "Mostly because of my father, I",
    "guess.",
    "Oh, come on.  How could you know",
    "my father?  You don't even know",
    "who I am.",
    "Oh, I don't know what I'm doing",
    "here.  We're wasting our time.",
    "Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I",
    "can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm",
    "ready.",
    "Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low",
    "ceiling.",
    "But I've learned so much.",
    "I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.",
    "Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?",
    "But how am I to know the good side",
    "from the bad?",
    "But tell me why I can't...",
    "There's something not right here.",
    "I feel cold, death.",
    "What's in there?",
    "Oh, no.  We'll never get it out",
    "now.",
    "Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.",
    "Master, moving stones around is",
    "one thing.  This is totally",
    "different.",
    "All right, I'll give it a try.",
    "I can't.  It's too big.",
    "You want the impossible.",
    "Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter.  With his eyes closed and",
    "his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.",
    "Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo",
    "beeps in terror and scoots away.",
    "I don't... I don't believe it.",
    "I saw... I saw a city in the",
    "clouds.",
    "Future?  Will they die?",
    "I've got to go to them.",
    "I can't keep the vision out of my",
    "head.  They're my friends.  I've",
    "got to help them.",
    "But I can help them!  I feel",
    "the Force!",
    "But I've learned so much since",
    "then.  Master Yoda, I promise to",
    "return and finish what I've begun.",
    "You have my word.",
    "And that is why I have to go.",
    "You won't.",
    "I understand.",

    "X-wing)",
    "Artoo, fire up the converters.",
    "Artoo whistles a happy reply.",
    "I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.",
    "No, Threepio's with them.",
    "Artoo whistles another worried inquiry.",
    "Just hang on.  We're almost there.",
    "You'll find I'm full of surprises.",
    "No!",
    "Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly.  All",
    "the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.",
    "I'll never join you!",
    "He told me enough!  It was you",
    "who killed him.",
    "No.  No.  That's not true!",

    "No!  No!  No!",
    "Ben... Ben, please!",

    "Oh, Leia.",
    "Father.",
    "Ben, why didn't you tell me?",

    "You're trembling.",

    "There's an awful lot of moisture",
    "in here.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's",

    "off if there are any more.",
    "Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air.  Leia",
    "puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the",
    "ship.  Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster.  Several of",
    "the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit",

    "Wait a minute...",
    "He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.",
    "All right, Chewie, let's get",
    "out of here!",
    "The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes",
    "to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel.  Leia",
    "hurries after.",
    "No time to discuss this in",
    "committee.",
    "And with that he is gone.  The main engines of the Falcon begin to",
    "whine.  Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.",
    "Sit down, sweetheart.  We're",
    "taking off!",
    "As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks.  He notices something",
    "out the window ahead.  Threepio sees it too.",
    "I see it, I see it.",
    "Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen",
    "surrounding the entrance.  And as the Falcon moves forward, the",
    "entrance to the cave grows ever smaller.  Han pulls hard on the",
    "throttle, sending his ship surging forward.",
    "This is no cave.",
    "Let's get out of here.  Ready for",
    "light-speed?  One... two... three!",
    "It's not fair!",
    "Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and",
    "captain.  Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.",
    "It's not my fault.",
    "Turn her around.",
    "Chewie barks in puzzlement.",
    "I said turn her around!  I'm",
    "going to put all power in the",
    "front shield.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Well, if they follow standard",
    "Imperial procedure, they'll dump",
    "their garbage before they go to",
    "light-speed, then we just float",
    "away.",
    "Then we've got to find a safe",

    "No.  Well, wait.  This is",
    "interesting.  Lando.",

    "Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando",
    "conned somebody out of it.  We",
    "go back a long way, Lando and me.",
    "No.  But he has no love for the",
    "Empire, I can tell you that.",
    "Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by.",
    "Detach!",

    "Lando Calrissian.",
    "More flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ship's",

    "Well, that was a long time ago.",
    "I'm sure he's forgotten about",
    "that.",

    "going to be fine.  Trust me.",
    "See?  My friend.",

    "(gestures toward",
    "the Falcon)",
    "Ahh... repairs.  I thought you",

    "huh?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and",
    "see what I can find out.",
    "Well, I don't trust him, either.",
    "But he is my friend.  Besides,",
    "we'll soon be gone.",
    "Where?  Found him in a junk pile?",
    "Lando's got people who can fix",
    "him.",
    "No.  No problem.  Why?",
    "Aren't you afraid the Empire's",
    "going to find out about this",
    "little operation and shut you down?",
    "I'm sorry, too.",

    "Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear",
    "me?  Stop!",
    "Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help",
    "me.  Hey!",
    "Save your strength.  There'll be",

    "Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.",
    "In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too",
    "I know.",

    "Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I",
    "got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.",
    "Jabba laughs.",
    "JABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)",
    "It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but",
    "now you're Bantha fodder.",

    "Luke!",
    "Fine. Together again, huh?",
    "How are we doing?",
    "That bad, huh? Where's Leia?",
    "Good, I hate long waits.",
    "On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?",
    "Chewie barks his agreement.",
    "I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a",
    "big light blur.",
    "You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.",
    "Oh... great!",
    "Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get",
    "no such pleasure from us. Right?",
    "Chewie growls his agreement.",
    "Chewie, you okay? Where is he?",
    "The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.",
    "I'm okay, pal.",
    "For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a",
    "cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong",
    "cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from",
    "the wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight",
    "up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable",

    "gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the",
    "skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail",
    "Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up",
    "the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his",
    "head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks",
    "the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.",
    "Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!",
    "Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let",
    "go of the spear.",

    "It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.",
    "Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!",
    "I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!",
    "No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest",
