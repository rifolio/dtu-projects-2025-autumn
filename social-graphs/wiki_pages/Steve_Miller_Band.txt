The '''Steve Miller Band''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[San Francisco]], California, in 1966. The band is led by [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]] on [[guitar]] and lead vocals. The group had a string of mid- to late-1970s hit singles that are staples of [[classic rock]] radio, as well as several earlier [[psychedelic rock]] albums. Miller left his first band to move to San Francisco and form the Steve Miller Blues Band.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cava |first=Marco della |date=August 27, 2023 |title=Steve Miller recalls late '60s San Francisco music having 'a dark side' but 'so much beauty' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/08/25/steve-miller-santana-grateful-dead-and-the-san-francisco-sounds/70678021007/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231208130528/https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/08/25/steve-miller-santana-grateful-dead-and-the-san-francisco-sounds/70678021007/ |archive-date=December 8, 2023 |access-date=May 30, 2024 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref> Shortly after Harvey Kornspan negotiated the band's contract with [[Capitol Records]] in 1967, the band shortened its name to the Steve Miller Band. In February 1968, the band recorded its debut album, ''[[Children of the Future (Steve Miller Band album)|Children of the Future]]''. It went on to produce the albums ''[[Sailor (Steve Miller Band album)|Sailor]]'', ''[[Brave New World (Steve Miller Band album)|Brave New World]]'', ''[[Your Saving Grace]]'', ''[[Number 5 (Steve Miller Band album)|Number 5]]'', ''[[The Joker (album)|The Joker]]'', ''[[Fly Like an Eagle (album)|Fly Like an Eagle]]'', and ''[[Book of Dreams]]'', among others. The band's album ''[[Greatest Hits 1974–78]]'', released in 1978, has sold over 13 million copies. In 2016, Steve Miller was inducted as a solo artist into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==History==
[[Image:Steve Miller Interlochen.jpg|thumb|Steve Miller performing at [[Interlochen Center for the Arts#Interlochen Arts Camp|Interlochen Fine Arts Camp]] on July 20, 2009]]

In 1965, after moving to Chicago to play the [[blues]], Steve Miller and keyboardist [[Barry Goldberg]] founded the Goldberg-Miller Blues Band along with bassist Roy Ruby, rhythm guitarist Craymore Stevens, and drummer Maurice McKinley. The band contracted to [[Epic Records]] and recorded a single, "The Mother Song", which they performed on ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'', before Miller left the group and moved to San Francisco.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uy6aKA1rTrEC&pg=PR48-IA23|page=xiviii|title=Crossroads: How the Blues Shaped Rock 'n' Roll|author=John Milward|publisher=UPNE|date= 2013|isbn=9781555537449}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/goldberg-miller-blues-band-1965-66-mw0000593963|work=allmusic.com|author=Lindsay Planer|title=Barry Goldberg / The Goldberg-Miller Blues Band Goldberg-Miller Blues Band 1965-66}}</ref>

Miller then formed the Steve Miller Blues Band. Harvey Kornspan, managing partner, wrote and negotiated the band's contract ($860,000 over five years as well as $25,000 of promotion money that was to be spent at the band's discretion) with Capitol/[[EMI|EMI Records]] then-president [[Alan W. Livingston|Alan Livingston]] in 1967. Shortly after, the band's name was shortened to the Steve Miller Band at the recommendation of [[George Martin]] in order to broaden its appeal. The band, consisting of Miller, guitarist James Cooke, bassist Lonnie Turner, drummer [[Tim Davis (musician)|Tim Davis]] (who replaced the departing Lance Haas) and Jim Peterman on Hammond B3 organ, backed [[Chuck Berry]] at a gig at the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] that was released as the live album, ''[[Live at the Fillmore Auditorium (Chuck Berry album)|Live at Fillmore Auditorium]]''.<ref name="chuckberry">{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckberry.us/wolfgangsvault.html |title=Chuck Berry News |publisher=Chuckberry.us |access-date=2014-08-23}}</ref> Guitarist [[Boz Scaggs]] joined the band soon after and the group performed at the [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival|Magic Mountain Festival]] (festival was held June 10/11, 1967) and the following week at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] (festival was held June 16/17/18, 1967).

In March 1968, while in England, the band recorded their debut album, ''[[Children of the Future (Steve Miller Band album)|Children of the Future]]'', at Olympic studios with [[Glyn Johns]] as engineer/producer. The album did not score among the Top 100 album chart. The visit itself got off to a poor start also as the group and their entourage were arrested for 'importing drugs and possession of a dangerous firearm'. Kornspan's wife had called Johns asking if he would appear as a character witness in the magistrate's court the day after the arrest and, hopefully, stand bail for them. Johns agreed and the group was released on condition that Johns would 'stand surety for their good behavior' for the rest of their time in England. Both accusations were dropped. The 'dangerous firearm' turned out to be a non-working flare gun that was being used as a wall decoration in the house where the group was staying. The 'imported drugs' happened to be some hash that was buried in the middle of a large fruitcake that had been sent to the group by a stateside friend, unbeknownst to anyone in the group.<ref name=Johns>{{cite book |last1=Johns |first1=Glyn |title=Sound Man |date=2015 |publisher=Plume |location=New York |isbn=978-0-14-751657-2 |pages=98–103 |edition=First}}</ref>

The second album ''[[Sailor (Steve Miller Band album)|Sailor]]'' appeared in October 1968 and climbed the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart to {{thinspace|No.| 24}}. Successes included the single "Living in the USA". ''[[Brave New World (Steve Miller Band album)|Brave New World]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 22}}, 1969) featured the songs "Space Cowboy" and "My Dark Hour".  [[Paul McCartney]], credited as "Paul Ramon", played drums, bass and sang backing vocals on "My Dark Hour". This was followed by ''[[Your Saving Grace]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 38}}, 1969) and ''[[Number 5 (Steve Miller Band album)|Number 5]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 23}}, 1970). In 1971, Miller broke his neck in a car accident. Capitol Records released the album ''[[Rock Love]]'', featuring unreleased live performances and studio material. This is one of two Steve Miller Band albums not to be reissued on CD until 2022, the other being ''[[Recall the Beginning...A Journey from Eden]]''. In 1972, the double album compilation ''[[Anthology (Steve Miller Band album)|Anthology]]'' was released, containing 16 songs from five of the band's first seven albums.

The style and personnel of the band changed radically with ''[[The Joker (album)|The Joker]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 2}}, 1973), concentrating on straightforward rock and leaving the psychedelic blues side of the band behind. The title track, "[[The Joker (Steve Miller Band song)|The Joker]]", became a {{thinspace|No.| 1}} single and was certified 5× platinum, reaching over five million sales. It was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on January 11, 1974.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/332 332]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/332}}</ref>

Three years later, the band returned with the album ''[[Fly Like an Eagle (album)|Fly Like an Eagle]]'', which charted at {{thinspace|No.| 3}}. Three singles were released from the album: "[[Take the Money and Run (Steve Miller Band song)|Take the Money and Run]]" ({{thinspace|No.| 11}}), "[[Fly Like an Eagle (song)|Fly Like an Eagle]]" ({{thinspace|No.| 2}}) and their second {{thinspace|No.| 1}} success, "[[Rock'n Me]]". Miller credits the guitar introduction to "Rock'n Me" as a tribute to the [[Free (band)|Free]] song, "[[All Right Now]]".<ref name="gb">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=%22yeah+it%27s+a+tack+on+the+wall+for+Paul%22&pg=PT456 | title=Billboard book of number 1 hits | isbn=9780823076772 | last1=Bronson | first1=Fred | year=2003 | publisher=Billboard Books }}</ref>

''[[Book of Dreams (Steve Miller Band album)|Book of Dreams]]'' ({{thinspace|No.| 2}}, 1977) also included three successes: "[[Jet Airliner (Steve Miller Band song)|Jet Airliner]]" ({{thinspace|No.| 8}}), "[[Jungle Love (Steve Miller Band song)|Jungle Love]]" ({{thinspace|No.| 23}}), and "[[Swingtown (song)|Swingtown]]" ({{thinspace|No.| 17}}).

Released in 1978, ''The Steve Miller Band's Greatest Hits 1974–78'' has sold over 15 million copies.<ref name="independentmail.com">{{cite web |author=Jake Grove |url=http://www.independentmail.com/news/2008/oct/15/steve-miller-band-hits-littlejohn-clemson/ |title=The Steve Miller Band hits Littlejohn in Clemson |publisher=Independent Mail |date=2008-10-15 |access-date=2014-08-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116201440/http://www.independentmail.com/news/2008/oct/15/steve-miller-band-hits-littlejohn-clemson/ |archive-date=2014-01-16 }}</ref>

1982's ''[[Abracadabra (Steve Miller Band album)|Abracadabra]]'' album gave Steve Miller his third {{thinspace|No.| 1}} success with [[Abracadabra (Steve Miller Band song)|the title track]].  Miller's hit pushed [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s "[[Hard to Say I'm Sorry]]" out of the {{thinspace|No.| 1}} spot, just as his "Rock'n Me" had knocked Chicago's "[[If You Leave Me Now]]" out of the {{thinspace|No.| 1}} spot in 1976.<ref name="gb"/>

''[[Bingo! (Steve Miller Band album)|Bingo!]]'', an album of blues and [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] covers, was released on June 15, 2010. ''[[Let Your Hair Down (album)|Let Your Hair Down]]'', a companion release to ''Bingo!'', was released 10 months later, on April 18, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://planetrock.com/newscentre/rock-news/steve-miller-band-announce-new-album-1463 |title=Steve Miller Band announce new album |publisher=Planet Rock |date=2011-02-11 |access-date=2011-12-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215033644/http://www.planetrock.com/newscentre/rock-news/steve-miller-band-announce-new-album-1463 |archive-date=2011-02-15 }}</ref>

Founding member Tim Davis died from complications due to diabetes on September 20, 1988, at the age of 44. Long-time band member [[Norton Buffalo]] died from [[lung cancer]] on October 30, 2009. John King (drummer during "The Joker" era) died after a short bout with [[kidney cancer]] on October 26, 2010. James Cooke died from cancer on 16 May 2011. Original bassist Lonnie Turner died from lung cancer on April 28, 2013. His time with the band led to songs such as Jet Airliner, Swingtown, Take the Money And Run, Jungle Love and many more. Blues guitarist Jacob Petersen officially joined the band before the Spring 2011 tour. Following Petersen joining the band, longtime guitarist Kenny Lee Lewis switched instruments to become the band's full-time bassist. In 2014, Steve Miller Band toured with fellow San Francisco rock band [[Journey (band)|Journey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevemillerband.com |title=Steve Miller Band Official Site |publisher=Stevemillerband.com |date=2014-05-18 |access-date=2014-08-23}}</ref>

When it was announced that Steve Miller would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist without his band, Miller told ''Rolling Stone'', "It wasn't my decision, and I didn't have any input into any of it. If they had asked me what do, I think I would have said, 'Here's a list of everyone that was ever in my band. They all ought to be here.'"<ref>Greene, Andy (2015, December 17).
