While the Byrds outwardly seemed to be riding the crest of a wave during the latter half of 1965, the recording sessions for their second album had not been without tension. One source of conflict was the power struggle that had begun to develop between producer Melcher and the band's manager, Jim Dickson, with the latter harboring aspirations to produce the band himself, causing him to be overly critical of the former's work.<ref name="timeless25">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=147–149|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> Within a month of ''Turn!

===Psychedelia (1965–1967)===
On December 22, 1965, the Byrds recorded a new, self-penned composition titled "[[Eight Miles High]]" at [[RCA Records|RCA]] Studios in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=75|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> Columbia Records refused to release this version because it had been recorded at another [[record company]]'s facility.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=152|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> As a result, the band was forced to re-record the song at Columbia Studios in Los Angeles on January 24 and 25, 1966.

"Eight Miles High" is marked by McGuinn's groundbreaking lead guitar playing, which saw the guitarist attempting to emulate the [[Free jazz|free form jazz]] [[saxophone]] playing of [[John Coltrane]], and in particular, Coltrane's playing on the song "India" from his ''[[Impressions (John Coltrane album)|Impressions]]'' album.<ref name="einarson4"/> It also exhibits the influence of the [[Indian classical music]] of [[Ravi Shankar]] in the droning quality of the song's vocal melody and in McGuinn's guitar playing.<ref name="lavezzoli">{{cite book|author=Lavezzoli, Peter.|pages=155–157|year=2007|title=The Dawn of Indian music in the West|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-2819-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Crosby, David.|page=99|year=1990|title=Long Time Gone: The Autobiography of David Crosby|publisher=Mandarin Paperbacks|isbn=0-7493-0283-6}}</ref> The song's subtle use of Indian influences resulted in it being labeled as "raga rock" by the [[Music journalism|music press]], but in fact, it was the single's B-side, "[[Why (The Byrds song)|Why]]", that drew more directly on Indian [[raga]]s.<ref name="einarson4"/><ref name="lavezzoli"/>

Upon release, "Eight Miles High" was banned by many U.S. radio stations, following allegations made by the broadcasting trade journal the ''[[Gavin Report]]'' that its lyrics advocated [[Psychoactive drug#Recreational use|recreational drug use]].<ref name="timeless7">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=158–161|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> The band and their management strenuously denied these allegations, stating that the song's lyrics actually described an airplane flight to London and the band's subsequent concert tour of England.<ref name="timeless7"/> The relatively modest chart success of "Eight Miles High" (number 14 in the U.S. and number 24 in the UK) has been largely attributed to the broadcasting ban, although the challenging and slightly uncommercial nature of the track is another possible reason for its failure to reach the Top 10.<ref name="einarson4"/><ref name="timeless7"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=92|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref>

===Lineup changes (1967–1968)===

===Country rock (1968–1973)===

====Gram Parsons era====
[[File:The Byrds with Gram Parsons and Kevin Kelley.jpg|thumb|The Byrds in 1968, L to R: Gram Parsons, Kevin Kelley, Hillman, McGuinn]]
Following his induction into the band, Gram Parsons began to assert his own musical agenda in which he intended to marry his love of [[Country music|country and western]] music with youth culture's passion for rock and, in doing so, make country music fashionable for a young audience.<ref name="byrdwatcher5"/><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=GP/Grievous Angel|others=[[Gram Parsons]]|year=1990|first=Marley|last=Brant|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[Reprise Records]]}}</ref> He found a kindred spirit in Hillman, who had played mandolin in a number of notable [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands before joining the Byrds.<ref name="byrdwatcher5"/> In addition, Hillman had also persuaded the Byrds to incorporate subtle country influences into their music in the past, beginning with the song "[[A Satisfied Mind|Satisfied Mind]]" on the ''Turn! Turn! Turn!'' album.<ref name="byrdwatcher5"/> Although McGuinn had some reservations about the band's proposed new direction, Parsons convinced him that a move towards country music could theoretically expand the group's declining audience.<ref name="fricke4">{{cite AV media notes|title=Sweetheart of the Rodeo: Legacy Edition|title-link=Sweetheart of the Rodeo|others=The Byrds|year=2003|first=David|last=Fricke|type=CD booklet|publisher=Columbia/Legacy}}</ref>  Thus, McGuinn was persuaded to change direction and abandon his original concept for the group's next album, which had been to record a history of 20th century [[American popular music]], and instead explore country rock.<ref name="byrdwatcher4"/><ref name="fricke4"/>

On March 9, 1968, the band decamped to Columbia's recording studios in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with Clarence White in tow, to begin the recording sessions for the ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'' album.<ref name="fricke4"/> While in Nashville, the Byrds also appeared at the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on March 15, 1968, where they performed the [[Merle Haggard]] song "[[Sing Me Back Home (song)|Sing Me Back Home]]" and Parsons' own "[[Hickory Wind]]" (although they were actually scheduled to play a second Haggard song, "Life in Prison").<ref name="hjort10">{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|pages=164–165|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> Being the first group of [[hippie]] "longhairs" ever to play at the venerable country music institution, the band was met with heckling, booing, and mocking calls of "tweet, tweet" from the conservative ''Opry'' audience.<ref name="fricke4"/>

The band also incurred the wrath of renowned country music DJ [[Ralph Emery]], when they appeared on his Nashville-based [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] radio program.<ref name="hjort10"/> Emery mocked the band throughout their interview and made no secret of his dislike for their newly recorded country rock single, "[[You Ain't Goin' Nowhere]]".<ref name="byrdwatcher7">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/lpdbmh.html|access-date=October 31, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819212941/http://www.ebni.com/byrds/lpdbmh.html|archive-date=August 19, 2009}}</ref> Parsons and McGuinn would later write the pointedly sarcastic song "Drug Store Truck Drivin' Man" about Emery and their appearance on his show.<ref name="hjort10"/><ref name="byrdwatcher7"/> Journalist David Fricke has described the reactions of Emery and the ''Grand Ole Opry'' audience as indicative of the resistance and hostility that the Byrds' venture into country music provoked from the Nashville old guard.<ref name="fricke3"/>

Following their stay in Nashville, the band returned to Los Angeles and throughout April and May 1968, they worked on completing their new country-oriented album.<ref name="fricke4"/>  During this period, Parsons attempted to exert a controlling influence over the group by pressuring McGuinn to recruit either [[JayDee Maness]]<!--not "Jay Dee"--> or [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]] as the band's permanent [[pedal steel guitar]] player.<ref name="timeless28">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=257–258|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> When McGuinn refused, Parsons next began to push for a higher salary, while also demanding that the group be billed as "Gram Parsons and the Byrds" on their forthcoming album.<ref name="timeless27"/> Even Hillman, who had previously been Parsons' biggest supporter in the band, began to grow weary of his forceful demands.<ref name="timeless27"/> Ultimately, Parsons' behavior led to a power struggle for control of the group, with McGuinn finding his position as band leader challenged.<ref name="timeless28"/> Biographer Johnny Rogan has pointed out that the April 1968 release of "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" served to strengthen McGuinn's position as head Byrd, with the guitarist's familiar drawl occupying the lead vocal spot and negligible input from Parsons, despite the single's obvious country leanings.<ref name="timeless28"/>

Parsons' dominance over the band waned still further during post-production for ''Sweetheart of the Rodeo'', when his appearance on the album was contested by music business impresario [[Lee Hazlewood]], who alleged that the singer was still under contract to his [[LHI Records|LHI record label]], creating legal complications for Columbia Records.<ref name="fricke3"/> As a result of this, McGuinn and Hillman replaced Parsons' lead vocals on the songs "[[You Don't Miss Your Water]]", "The Christian Life", and "One Hundred Years from Now" before the legal problems could be resolved.<ref name="hjort11">{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=176|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> Album producer Gary Usher would later put a different slant on the events surrounding the removal of Parsons' vocals by telling his biographer Stephen J.

When the ''Byrdmaniax'' album was released on June 23, 1971,<ref name="allmusic11"/> it was received poorly by most critics and did much to undermine the new-found popularity that the Byrds had enjoyed since the release of ''Ballad of Easy Rider''.<ref name="fricke7"/> The response to the album from the American [[Music journalism|music press]] was particularly scathing, with a review in the August 1971 edition of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine describing the Byrds as "a boring dead group" and memorably dismissing the entire album as "increments of pus".<ref name="hjort20">{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=279|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> The consensus among most reviewers was that ''Byrdmaniax'' was hampered by Melcher's inappropriate [[orchestration]] and by being an album almost totally bereft of the Byrds' signature sound.<ref name="fricke7"/> The band themselves were publicly critical of the album upon its release, with Gene Parsons referring to it as "Melcher's folly".<ref name="timeless22"/> For his part, Melcher later stated that he felt that the band's performances in the studio during the making of ''Byrdmaniax'' were lackluster and he therefore employed the orchestration in order to cover up the album's musical shortcomings.<ref name="byrdwatcher9"/> By the time of the album's release, Melcher had resigned as the Byrds' manager and producer.<ref name="timeless22"/> Despite the band's dissatisfaction with the finished product and its poor critical reception, ''Byrdmaniax'' made a respectable showing on the U.S. charts, peaking at number 46,<ref name="hjort20"/> but failed to sell in sufficient quantities to reach the UK charts.<ref name="hjort21"/> Author [[Christopher Hjort]] has remarked that in the years since its release, ''Byrdmaniax'' has become arguably "the least-liked album in the Byrds catalogue" among the group's fanbase.<ref name="hjort21"/>

The five original members of the Byrds reunited briefly during late 1972, while McGuinn was still undertaking selected concerts with the touring version of the group.<ref name="hjort25"/> Discussions regarding a reunion between [[Roger McGuinn]], [[Gene Clark]], [[David Crosby]], [[Chris Hillman]], and [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] had taken place as early as July 1971, around the same time as the then current line-up of the band were recording the ''[[Farther Along (The Byrds album)|Farther Along]]'' album.<ref name="timeless31"/>  Plans for a reunion accelerated in mid-1972, when the founder of [[Asylum Records]], [[David Geffen]], offered each of the original band members a sizable amount of money to reform and record an album for his label.<ref name="einarson8">{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|pages=178–180|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref>  The reunion actually took place in early October 1972, beginning with a rehearsal at McGuinn's house, where the group began selecting suitable material for a new album.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=340|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> The five original Byrds booked into [[Wally Heider Studios#Background|Wally Heider's Studio 3]] in Hollywood from October 16 until November 15, 1972, recording their first album together in seven years.<ref name="hjort28"/>

[[File:David Crosby in 1976.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Following his dismissal from the band in 1967, David Crosby (pictured in 1976) was critical of Roger McGuinn's decision to recruit new band members, while continuing to use the Byrds name.]]
Following completion of the album, Crosby persuaded McGuinn to dissolve the Columbia version of the Byrds, who were still touring at that time.<ref name="timeless30"/>  Crosby had long been vocal regarding his displeasure over McGuinn's decision to recruit new band members following his dismissal from the group in 1967, and had stated in a number of interviews that in his opinion "there were only ever five Byrds".<ref name="einarson8"/>  In keeping with the new spirit of reconciliation that the reunion fostered, McGuinn permanently disbanded the Columbia lineup of the group in February 1973.<ref name="fricke8"/>

The reunion album, titled simply ''[[Byrds (album)|Byrds]]'', was released on March 7, 1973, to mixed reviews.<ref name="hjort27"/> As a result, a planned tour in support of the album failed to materialize.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/> Among the album's shortcomings, critics made note of a lack of sonic unity and the absence of the Byrds' signature jangly guitar sound.<ref name="hjort27"/> The album managed to climb to number 20 on the ''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tapes chart and number 31 in the UK.<ref name="hjort27"/> In the United States, the album became the band's highest charting LP of new material since 1965's ''[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (album)|Turn! Turn! Turn!]]'', which had also been the last Byrds' album to feature Gene Clark as a full member.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/> Among the tracks included on the album were McGuinn's folk-flavored "Sweet Mary", the [[Joni Mitchell]] cover "For Free", a re-recording of Crosby's song "Laughing" (which had originally appeared on his 1971 solo album, ''[[If I Could Only Remember My Name]]''), and a pair of [[Neil Young]] songs.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/> The album also featured the Gene Clark compositions "Changing Heart" and "[[Full Circle Song|Full Circle]]", the latter of which had provided the reunion album with its [[working title]] and was subsequently released as a single, although it failed to chart.<ref name="hjort27"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=349|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>

The negative critical reception that ''Byrds'' received in the music press resulted in the band losing faith in the idea of an ongoing series of reunions.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/> In the years following its release, all five band members were openly critical of the album, with the general consensus being that the material included on it was weak and that the recording sessions had been rushed and ill-thought out.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/> In addition, McGuinn and Hillman have both suggested that with the exception of Gene Clark, the songwriting members of the band were reluctant to bring their strongest compositions to the recording sessions, preferring instead to hold those songs back for their own solo projects.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/><ref name="einarson8"/> In the wake of the reunion, the five original Byrds quietly returned to their own careers,<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/> with the June 1973 release of McGuinn's [[Roger McGuinn (album)|eponymously titled solo album]] serving to effectively mark the end of the Byrds.

Following the reunion of 1972/1973, the Byrds remained disbanded throughout the rest of the decade.<ref name="allmusic"/> Roger McGuinn turned his attention to establishing his own career, releasing a series of solo albums between 1973 and 1977, and making a high-profile appearance with [[Bob Dylan]]'s [[Rolling Thunder Revue]].<ref name="allmusic2"/> Chris Hillman worked as part of the [[Souther–Hillman–Furay Band]] following the Byrds reunion and released a pair of solo albums entitled ''Slippin' Away'' and ''Clear Sailin''' in 1976 and 1977 respectively.<ref name="allmusic9"/> David Crosby returned to the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] for their 1974 tour and subsequently continued to produce albums with [[Graham Nash]].<ref name="allmusic13"/> He also took part in a 1977 reunion of Crosby, Stills & Nash, which saw the group release their multi-[[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] selling ''[[CSN (album)|CSN]]'' album.<ref name="allmusic13"/> Michael Clarke also found success following the Byrds reunion as the drummer for [[soft rock]] group [[Firefall]],<ref name="allmusic7"/> while Gene Clark returned to his solo career, producing the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful albums ''[[No Other]]'' (1974) and ''[[Two Sides to Every Story]]'' (1977).<ref name="allmusic5"/>

====McGuinn, Clark & Hillman (1977–1981)====
{{Main|McGuinn, Clark & Hillman}}
Between 1977 and 1980, McGuinn, Clark and Hillman worked on and off together as a trio, modeled after Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and, to a lesser extent, the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Eder|first=Bruce|title=McGuinn, Clark & Hillman Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mcguinn-clark-hillman-p4872/biography|access-date=April 19, 2011|archive-date=November 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129020700/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mcguinn-clark-hillman-p4872/biography|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=Requiem for the Timeless, Volume 1|year=2012|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=978-0-95295-408-8|pages=664–667}}</ref>  This supergroup made up of former Byrds was reasonably successful commercially and managed to score a Top 40 hit with the single "[[Don't You Write Her Off]]" in March 1979.<ref name="byrdwatcher11">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=McGuinn, Clark & Hillman|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spmch1.html|access-date=April 19, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514043522/http://ebni.com/byrds/spmch1.html|archive-date=May 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Whitburn, Joel.|page=556|year=2008|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2006|publisher=Record Research Inc|isbn=978-0-89820-172-7}}</ref> The trio toured internationally and recorded the albums ''McGuinn, Clark & Hillman'' and ''City''.<ref name="byrdwatcher11"/> Clark departed the group in late 1979, resulting in a third and final album being billed as McGuinn-Hillman.<ref name="byrdwatcher11"/> The two former Byrds continued to play low-key gigs after the release of the ''McGuinn/Hillman'' album, but they split up in early 1981.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=Requiem for the Timeless, Volume 1|year=2012|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=978-0-95295-408-8|pages=712–715}}</ref>

====Ersatz Byrds and further reunions (1989–1991; 2000)====
In 1984, Gene Clark approached McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman in an attempt to reform the Byrds in time for the 20th anniversary of the release of the "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" single in 1985.<ref name="byrdwatcher12">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Byrds v.

After the tour wound down in late 1985, Clark returned to his solo career, leaving Michael Clarke to soldier on with a band that was now billed as "A Tribute to the Byrds" (although again, it was often shortened to the Byrds by promoters).<ref name="timeless32">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=424–430|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> Gene Clark returned to the group following the release of his and [[Carla Olson]]'s ''So Rebellious a Lover'' album, and the tribute band continued to work on and off in 1987 and 1988.<ref>{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|page=261|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> Author Johnny Rogan has stated that most die-hard fans of the Byrds were mortified by the existence of this ersatz version of the group, while Byrds expert Tim Connors has commented that "no chapter in the history of the Byrds caused as much consternation and controversy among fans".<ref name="byrdwatcher12"/><ref name="timeless32"/>

In June 1988, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman appeared at a concert celebrating the reopening of the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]] folk club in Los Angeles.<ref name="timeless32"/>  Although they were billed as solo artists, the three musicians came together for an on-stage reunion during the show, performing a string of Byrds hits including "Mr. Tambourine Man" and "Eight Miles High".<ref name="timeless32"/>  Although Clark and Clarke's Byrds tribute group was inactive at the time of this high-profile get-together of McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman, Michael Clarke did mount another tribute tour shortly afterwards, this time featuring former Byrd [[Skip Battin]] and newcomers Terry Jones Rogers and Jerry Sorn, under the banner of "the Byrds featuring Michael Clarke".<ref name="timeless32"/><ref name="byrdwatcher13">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Byrds v.

In retaliation against Clarke's trademark application, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman submitted their own counter-claim to gain ownership of the band's name.<ref name="byrdwatcher13"/> McGuinn had actually attempted to trademark the Byrds name himself during the 1970s, in order to prevent its misuse, but his application had been turned down.<ref name="timeless32"/> To strengthen their case, the three musicians announced in December 1988 that they would be performing a series of concerts in January 1989 as the Byrds.<ref name="timeless32"/><ref name="byrdwatcher13"/> Although he was no longer connected with Clarke's tribute act, Gene Clark was not invited to participate in these official Byrds reunion concerts due to residual ill-feeling stemming from his earlier "20th Anniversary Tribute to the Byrds".<ref name="byrdwatcher13"/>

The reunion concerts were a resounding success, but with Michael Clarke continuing to tour with his Byrds tribute, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman filed a lawsuit against the drummer in the spring of 1989, suing him for allegedly false advertising, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices, as well as seeking a preliminary injunction against Clarke's use of the name.<ref name="timeless32"/><ref name="byrdwatcher13"/> At the court hearing in May 1989, the judge denied the injunction, ruling that McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman had failed to show that they would be irreparably damaged by Clarke's actions.<ref name="byrdwatcher13"/>  As a result, Clarke gained full legal ownership of the name the Byrds.<ref name="hjort29">{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|pages=323–324|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-15-2}}</ref> In the wake of this ruling, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman dropped their lawsuit, but to demonstrate that they had not wholly surrendered the Byrds name to Clarke, the three musicians appeared under the banner of the Original Byrds at a [[Roy Orbison]] tribute concert on February 24, 1990, where they were joined on-stage by Bob Dylan for a rendition of "Mr. Tambourine Man".<ref name="byrdwatcher13"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=439|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> Later that year, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman entered Treasure Isle Recorders in Nashville to record four new Byrds tracks for inclusion on the forthcoming ''[[The Byrds (boxed set)|The Byrds]]'' [[box set]].<ref name="timeless33"/>

On January 16, 1991, the five original members of the Byrds put aside their differences to appear together at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City for their induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="einarson9"/> The ceremony honored the original line-up of Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, David Crosby, Chris Hillman, and Michael Clarke, while later configurations of the group featuring such key personnel as Gram Parsons and Clarence White were quietly passed over.<ref name="einarson9"/> The occasion, which saw the band come together on stage to perform the songs "[[Turn! Turn! Turn!|Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There Is a Season)]]", "Mr. Tambourine Man", and "[[I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better]]", represented the first time that all five original Byrds had stood together since 1973.<ref name="einarson9"/>  Unfortunately, it would also represent the last time that the five original members were gathered together.<ref name="timeless34"/> Clark died later that year of [[Myocardial infarction|heart failure]], and on December 19, 1993, Clarke succumbed to [[liver failure|liver disease]] brought on by [[alcoholism]].<ref name="hjort29"/>

Following Clarke's death, Terry Jones Rogers resurrected the Byrds tribute act, with guitarist Scott Nienhaus and former Byrds Skip Battin and Gene Parsons on bass and drums respectively.<ref name="byrdstribute">{{Cite web|url=http://byrdstribute.com/BIO.php|title=Younger Than Yesterday: A Tribute to the Byrds - Biography|website=byrdstribute.com|publisher=One Eyed Parrot|access-date=November 18, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129033920/http://byrdstribute.com/BIO.php|archive-date=November 29, 2014}}</ref>  Performing under the banner of the Byrds Celebration, the tribute group toured extensively throughout the remainder of the 1990s, although Parsons was replaced by session drummer Vince Barranco in 1995 and Battin was forced to retire due to ill-health in 1997.<ref name="byrdstribute"/> Since 2002, Rogers and Nienhaus have continued to tour as part of the band Younger Than Yesterday: A Tribute to the Byrds, along with bassist Michael Curtis and drummer Tim Politte.<ref name="byrdstribute"/>

McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman all returned to their individual solo careers following the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony.<ref name="hjort29"/> The Byrds did reunite for a third time on August 8, 2000, to give an impromptu, one-off performance at a tribute concert for Fred Walecki, the owner of a Los Angeles music equipment store who was suffering from [[throat cancer]].<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite magazine|last=Baltin|first=Steve|title=Byrds Reunite for L.A.

Perhaps the most surprising development in the Byrds' story during the 2000s was the acquisition by David Crosby of the rights to the band's name in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Terry Jones|title=Younger Than Yesterday: Biography|publisher=terryjonesrogers.com|url=http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|access-date=April 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716212021/http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Varga|first=George|title=CD Proves to Everything There Is a Season|newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060924/news_1a24byrds.html|access-date=April 25, 2011}}</ref> Ownership of the Byrds' name had reverted to Clarke's estate upon his death in 1993 and Crosby's purchase served to effectively bring the convoluted battle for control of the group's name to an end.

To date, the Fred Walecki tribute concert appearance in 2000 was the last performance by the Byrds. However, Hillman and Crosby both expressed an interest in working with McGuinn again on Byrds projects, but the lead guitarist and head Byrd remained adamant that he was not interested in another full reunion.<ref name="hjort29"/> During an interview with music journalist John Nork, McGuinn replied "absolutely not", when asked if he had any plans to revive the Byrds, explaining, "No, I don't want to do that.

In their book ''Beyond and Before: Progressive Rock Since the 1960s'', academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell placed the Byrds among a list of bands that they included in the book "not merely as [[proto-prog|precursors]] of [[progressive rock|prog]] but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days".<ref name=Hegarty>{{citation|last1=Hegarty|first1=Paul|last2=Halliwell|first2=Martin|title=Beyond and Before: Progressive Rock Since the 1960s|year=2011|publisher=The Continuum International Publishing Group|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8264-2332-0|author-link1=Paul Hegarty (musician)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=taA2AqdCAJ0C |page=11}}</ref> In ''The Great Rock Discography'', music researcher [[Martin C. Strong]] describes the Byrds' cover of "Mr. Tambourine Man" as "a timeless slice of hypnotic, bittersweet pop" and a record that "did nothing less than change the course of pop/rock history".<ref>{{cite book|last=Strong|first=Martin C|author-link=Martin C.

Music historian [[Domenic Priore]] attempted to sum up the band's influence in his book ''Riot on Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in 60s Hollywood'', by stating: "Few of The Byrds' contemporaries can claim to have made such a subversive impact on popular culture. The band had a much larger, more positive impact on the world at large than any ''Billboard'' chart position or album sales or concert attendance figure could possibly measure."<ref>{{cite book |author=Priore, Domenic |page=85 |year=2007 |title=Riot on Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in 60s Hollywood |publisher=Jawbone Press |isbn=978-1-906002-04-6}}</ref>

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked the Byrds at number 45 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Petty|first=Tom|author-link=Tom Petty|title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time - No.&nbsp;45: The Byrds|magazine=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/the-byrds-20110420|access-date=April 26, 2011|archive-date=October 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019204345/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/the-byrds-20110420|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2006, they were inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Byrds - Music Inductees|url=http://vocalgroup.org/inductees/the-byrds/|access-date=2022-01-14|website=The Vocal Group Hall of Fame|language=en-US|archive-date=January 14, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220114002045/http://vocalgroup.org/inductees/the-byrds/|url-status=live}}</ref>
