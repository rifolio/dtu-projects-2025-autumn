==History==
===1999–2004: Formation and ''The All-American Rejects''===
{{Main|The All-American Rejects (album)}}
The band formed in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]] in 1999 while members Nick Wheeler and [[Tyson Ritter]] were still in high school. It was here that Ritter offered himself for bass duties. Eventually Wheeler and Ritter decided to form the All-American Rejects.<ref name=SGtranslated/> When asked where the name of the band came from, Mike Kennerty says, "It was a random name that sounded cool. I feel like we have grown into it over the years."<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/All-American-Rejects-guitarist-dishes-on-bands-name-Secret/36959.html|title = All-American Rejects guitarist dishes on band's name, 'Secret'|last = Nunn|first = Jerry|date = March 28, 2012|journal = Windy City Times|id = {{ProQuest|1011085927}}|access-date = February 25, 2020|archive-date = February 25, 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200225191359/http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/All-American-Rejects-guitarist-dishes-on-bands-name-Secret/36959.html|url-status = live}}</ref>

In 2000, while still in high school, the group made a demo simply labeled ''The All-American Rejects'', with Nick Wheeler (drums), Tyson Ritter (vocals, bass), and Jesse Tabish (guitar, vocals). The demo CD was engineered, mixed and mastered by Wheeler. It was also managed by Alisa Ben at Half-A-Cup Entertainment. The demo is now commonly referred to as ''The Blue Disc'' or ''The Blue Album''. The CD consisted of twelve songs, a few of which would be included on the ''Same Girl, New Songs'' demo made in 2001. Jesse Tabish later split from the group and later became a member of the folk band [[Other Lives (band)|Other Lives]]. Ritter and Wheeler put together the ''[[Same Girl, New Songs]]'' EP, which was soon sent to independent [[Doghouse Records]], where an intern saved the disc from the trash, and revealed it to the label owner. The All-American Rejects were soon signed to a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pHvSyzdVLH8/Sfz8HLqoFCI/AAAAAAAAKOQ/Wx2TNZ5YE40/s1600-h/DSCF4132.JPG |title=3.bp.glogspot.com |publisher=3.bp.blogspot.com |access-date=October 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708030416/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pHvSyzdVLH8/Sfz8HLqoFCI/AAAAAAAAKOQ/Wx2TNZ5YE40/s1600-h/DSCF4132.JPG |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2001, with producer Tim O'Heir, the band recorded their self-titled debut studio album, ''[[The All-American Rejects (album)|The All-American Rejects]]''. The album and its first single, "[[Swing, Swing]]," were released towards the end of 2002. The group began looking for additional members for a live act.<ref>http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?interview=178 {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> Edmond, Oklahoma resident Mike Kennerty joined on as rhythm guitarist soon before the album was released. Soon after, the band was having problems with drummer Tim Campbell. Campbell was later replaced by drummer Chris Gaylor, who knew and played in another band with Kennerty.<ref>{{cite journal

The group was then signed by [[DreamWorks Records]], a subsidiary of film company [[DreamWorks Pictures]] (also known as DreamWorks SKG). The band hit the road for eight shows in January, and DreamWorks issued a broader-scale distribution of the debut LP. The album peaked at No. 25 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] Album chart. The single "Swing, Swing" was also re-issued, which peaked on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at No. 60 as well as No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] [[Limbeck|chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the all-american rejects|chart=all}} |title=Billboard.com |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the all-american rejects|chart=Hot 100}} |title=Billboard.com |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref><ref name="billboard.com">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the all-american rejects|chart=Alternative Songs}} |title=Billboard.com |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref> The single "[[The Last Song (The All-American Rejects song)|The Last Song]]" was also released spring 2003, and climbed to No. 29 on the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name="billboard.com" />

Early in 2003, the band went on tour as an opening act for [[CKY (band)|CKY]]. While several differing stories have occurred concerning the tour, they were kicked off the tour shortly after it began.

In Spring 2003, the All-American Rejects set out on their first headlining tour, called the ''Too Bad For Hell Tour.'' In later 2003, the All-American Rejects released, ''[[Live from Oklahoma... The Too Bad for Hell DVD!]],'' their first live DVD – which was later certified Gold by the [[RIAA]]. During this time, they performed on the [[Vans Warped Tour]]. They would later be part of the lineup again in summer 2005. In November, the All-American Rejects joined the bands [[Motion City Soundtrack]] and [[Limbeck]] for six shows in the United Kingdom, the first date on the 16th, and the last on the 22nd.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motioncitymemories.com/MCSTourDates2003.pdf |title=Motioncitymemories.com |access-date=October 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007020827/http://www.motioncitymemories.com/MCSTourDates2003.pdf |archive-date=October 7, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

In November 2003, [[Universal Music Group]] (UMG) agreed to purchase DreamWorks Records from DreamWorks Pictures for roughly $100 million.<ref name="billboard1">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/68395/umg-to-acquire-dreamworks-records |title=UMG To Acquire DreamWorks Records |publisher=Billboard |date=2013-08-17 |access-date=2013-09-15}}</ref> The label was eventually shut down in January 2005, and during 2004, many DreamWorks artists were reassigned to different labels at UMG.<ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |date=January 24, 2004 |title=DreamWorks Keeps A&R Staff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQ8EAAAAMBAJ&dq=dreamworks+records+january+24+2004&pg=PA5 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |volume=116 |issue=4 |pages=5. 65 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

===2005–06: ''Move Along''===
{{Main|Move Along}}
In July 2005, the All-American Rejects released their second studio album, ''[[Move Along]],'' produced by [[Howard Benson]]. It was released via UMG's [[Interscope Records]], and the album's first single, "[[Dirty Little Secret]]," was released that summer to radio stations.

[[File:All american rejects.jpg|thumb|left|The All-American Rejects performing on December 4, 2006]]
At the end of 2005, the All-American Rejects embarked on ''The Rise of the Fall Tour'' along with [[The Academy Is...]] and [[Rooney (band)|Rooney]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=94780 |title=The Academy Is...

In 2006, the second single and [[Move Along (The All-American Rejects song)|title track]] from ''Move Along'' was released. Within the first weeks after premiering their video, it had been on the ''[[Total Request Live]]'' countdown, hitting number-one four days in a row. The single did not chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] until almost six months after its release, in June. On March 15, 2006, the All-American Rejects began a tour of the United States that wrapped up on May 13, 2006. On May 25, the All-American Rejects performed at the first ever [[VH1 Rock Honors]], covering "[[Photograph (Def Leppard song)|Photograph]]" by [[Def Leppard]]. In July the band sent a [[promotional single]] from ''Move Along,'' "[[Top of the World (The All-American Rejects song)|Top of the World]]," to modern rock radio. A music video was created for it from clips of the All-American Rejects on tour and in concert.

"[[Move Along (song)|Move Along]]" was also used to help promote the [[Lego]] [[Bionicle]] ''Inika'' toy sets in the summer of 2006. The group also participated in a promotion for the sets called "Free the Band". The overall priority of the promotion was that the Rejects got kidnapped by the villainous Piraka whilst sailing on a yacht and people had to assist the Inika on finding and rescuing the band via the website 'freetheband.com.' A competition could also be entered where the winners would receive Bionicle and All-American Rejects merchandise alike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/FreeTheBand.com |title=FreeTheBand.com - BIONICLEsector01 |publisher=Biosector01.com |date=December 3, 2009 |access-date=October 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928063823/http://www.biosector01.com/wiki/index.php/FreeTheBand.com |archive-date=September 28, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> That same year, "Move Along"  was featured in the film ''[[She's the Man]]'', which was released by former DreamWorks Records owner DreamWorks Pictures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/the-all-american-rejects/move-along/1000|title=Move Along by The All-American Rejects - Songfacts}}</ref>

In September 2006, a third headlining single, "[[It Ends Tonight]]," was released from ''Move Along.'' The video debuted at No. 10 on the VH1 Top 20 countdown. The video also peaked at No. 2 on ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]''.<ref>[http://www.lala.com/artist/The_All-American_Rejects/bio Lala.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219033958/http://www.lala.com/artist/The_All-American_Rejects/bio |date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref> Later in the year the All-American Rejects launched the ''Tournado'' tour in support of ''Move Along.'' The tour kicked off at [[Hartford, Connecticut]] on October 27, and wrapped up at [[Champaign, Illinois]] on December 20.

That New Year's Eve, the All-American Rejects performed on a special on Las Vegas' Fremont Street, which also included the bands [[OK Go]], [[Five for Fighting]], [[Rock Star Supernova]], and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]].

On December 21, 2024, the album hit 1 Billion streams on Spotify.

===2007–09: ''When the World Comes Down''===
{{Main|When the World Comes Down}}
The All-American Rejects began writing material for their third studio album in December 2006. The band also collaborated with composer [[Danny Elfman]] on "The Future Has Arrived," which was included on the soundtrack of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film ''[[Meet the Robinsons]].'' The song was created in conjunction with the film's musical score.

On July 17, 2007, the All-American Rejects released their second live DVD, titled ''[[Tournado (The All-American Rejects album)|Tournado]],'' with content from the 2006 headlining tour of the same name. Also during the summer, they covered "Jack's Lament" from ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]],'' which was featured on ''[[Nightmare Revisited]].''

In May 2009, the All-American Rejects released a second single in the United States, entitled "[[The Wind Blows (song)|The Wind Blows]]," which achieved moderate success. "[[I Wanna (The All-American Rejects song)|I Wanna]]" was released internationally on July 8 to Australia and the United Kingdom. Another song from ''[[When the World Comes Down]],'' In July, "Real World" was released as a promotional single in the United States, followed by "I Wanna" as a headliner. In late summer the All-American Rejects joined [[Weezer]], [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[Taking Back Sunday]] for the second half of the ''[[Blink-182 Reunion Tour]].'' On August 15, the All-American Rejects made history, performing alongside [[Hoobastank]], [[Raygun (band)|Raygun]], [[Boys Like Girls]], [[Pixie Lott]] and [[Kasabian]] as one of the live acts at Asia's very first [[MTV World Stage Live In Malaysia]] concert.<ref>MTV World Stage Live In Malaysia [https://web.archive.org/web/20090505161036/http://worldstage.mtvasia.com/ worldstage.mtvasia.com]</ref> This performance gained them recognition in Malaysia. ''When the World Comes Down'' soon sold over 15,000 digital and physical copies in the country. On August 21 the "I Wanna" single was issued to Austria and Germany.

In October 2009, the All-American Rejects were forced to cancel shows due to an injury to frontman Tyson Ritter. He performed from a wheelchair with his leg in a brace on September 27 during a show in Tampa, Florida, amid reports suggesting the singer had undergone knee surgery to remove a tumor that had been there for many months. Ritter's leg became infected, and he remained hospitalized for five days. Ritter made a full recovery in time to return to kick off the ''Battle Of The Bands Tour'' with Taking Back Sunday, with the first date at [[Michigan State University|MSU]] in Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/rejects-cancel-shows-after-ritters-mysterious-injury_1117914|title=All American Rejects – Rejects Cancel Shows After Ritter's Mysterious Injury|date=October 2, 2009 |publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]]|access-date=October 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207131952/http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/rejects-cancel-shows-after-ritters-mysterious-injury_1117914|archive-date=December 7, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7016575738?The%20All-American%20Rejects%20Cancel%20Shows%20Following%20Tyson%20Ritter%27s%20Injury]{{dead link|date=August 2022|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> At the end of 2009, Ritter suffered from [[alcohol abuse]] after ending a six-year relationship.

{{Main|Kids in the Street (The All-American Rejects album)}}
In February 2010, the All-American Rejects performed live at the [[Vancouver Winter Olympic Games]] at the Whistler Medals Plaza. They also had [[DirecTV]] performances at [[Super Bowl XLIV]] and a special set aired in February. The band also wrote and recorded the song "The Poison" for the ''[[Almost Alice]]'' compilation, a collection of songs representing the 2010 [[Tim Burton]] film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. From June 25 to July 18, the All-American Rejects toured the United States and Canada as part of the [[Warped Tour 2010]] festival.

Later that year, the band announced that they were working on a fourth studio album, which was planned to be released in early 2012. Songwriters Nick Wheeler and Tyson Ritter went on numerous writing retreats into secluded parts of the United States; a tradition of writing used on their previously released albums. Recording for the album wrapped up in June 2011, with mixing commencing the following August and concluding early September. On November 14, 2011, Ritter announced that ex [[Taking Back Sunday]] bassist [[Matt Rubano]] had joined the band as their bass player for live performances, but stated that Ritter is still the bass player recording-wise.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/tysonritter/status/135876882838200320 |title=Tyson Ritter Twitter post announcing Matt Rubano as Bassist |access-date=November 14, 2011 |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025193346/https://twitter.com/tysonritter/status/135876882838200320 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|user=tysonritter|author=Tyson ritteR|number=135960234882629632|date=November 14, 2011|title=Yes, I am the oNLY one that will ever play bass on our records.-- @Tomellott @tysonritter Did you still play bass on the album?}}</ref>

The All-American Rejects later embarked on their ''Shaking Off the Rust'' tour, which began in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], United States on January 18, 2012, and continued through the year – some of which they performed as a support act for [[Blink-182]]'s [[20th Anniversary Tour (Blink-182)|20th Anniversary Tour]] in the UK – and ended on July 27, 2013. The band performed at Sepang International Center in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia on September 27, 2013, alongside [[The Wanted]] and [[Five for Fighting]] as part of the [[Arthur's Day]] celebrations promoted by the [[Guinness]] brewing company.

In this time they penned two platinum records, developed a vice grip over high school movie soundtracks and quickly became poster boys for a style of punk so wet that it made [[Blink-182]] look like [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fawcettpublished |first=Paris |date=2021-07-14 |title=The 10 best songs from the 10 worst emo bands |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-best-songs-from-the-10-worst-emo-bands |access-date=2025-09-01 |website=Louder |language=en}}</ref>
