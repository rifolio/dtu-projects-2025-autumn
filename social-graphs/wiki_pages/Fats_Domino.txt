==Biography==
=== Early life and education ===
Antoine Domino Jr. was born and raised in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]], the youngest of eight children born to Antoine Caliste Domino (1879–1964) and Marie-Donatille Gros (1886–1971). The Domino family was of [[Louisiana Creole people|French Creole]] background, and [[Louisiana Creole]] was his first language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/fats-domino-9276748|title=Fats Domino|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=October 29, 2017}}</ref> Like most such families, the Dominos were [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Vera|first=Billy|title=Fats Domino|work=Blues and Rhythm|url=http://www.bluesandrhythm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Fats-Domino-BR-325-TB-Final-Proof.pdf|access-date=July 4, 2021}}</ref>

===Early career (1940s)===
By age 14, Domino was performing in New Orleans bars.<ref name="Rolling Stone death" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.offbeat.com/articles/back-talk-fats-domino-interview|title=BackTalk: Fats Domino (Interview)|first=Michael|last=Hurtt|work=OffBeat Magazine|date=June 1, 2004|access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref> In 1947, Billy Diamond, a New Orleans bandleader, accepted an invitation to hear the young pianist perform at a backyard barbecue. Domino played well enough that Diamond asked him to join his band, the Solid Senders, at the Hideaway Club in New Orleans, where he would earn $3 a week playing the piano.<ref name="book1" /> Diamond nicknamed him "Fats".

===Recordings for Imperial Records (1949–1962)===
Domino was signed to the [[Imperial Records]] label in 1949 by owner [[Lew Chudd]], to be paid royalties based on sales instead of a fee for each song. He and producer [[Dave Bartholomew]] wrote "[[The Fat Man (song)|The Fat Man]]", a toned down version of a song about drug addicts called "[[Junker Blues]]"; the record had sold a million copies by 1951.<ref name="auto" /> Featuring a rolling piano and Domino vocalizing "[[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]]" over a strong [[beat (music)|backbeat]], "The Fat Man" is widely considered the first rock-and-roll record to achieve this level of sales.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Friedlander|date=2006|title=Rock and Roll: A Social History|publisher=[[Westview Press]]|location=Boulder, Colorado|page=28|isbn=9780429963254}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/may/14/fatshowdominoinventedrockn|title=How Fats Domino invented rock'n'roll |first=Owen|last=Adams|work=The Guardian|date=May 14, 2007|access-date=October 25, 2017}}</ref> In 2015, the song would enter the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].<ref name="PBStimeline" />

Domino released a series of hit songs with Bartholomew (also the co-writer of many of the songs), the saxophonists [[Herbert Hardesty]] and [[Alvin Tyler|Alvin "Red" Tyler]], the bassist Billy Diamond and later [[Frank Fields]], and the drummers [[Earl Palmer]] and [[Smokey Johnson]]. Other notable and long-standing musicians in Domino's band were the saxophonists [[Reggie Houston]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reggiehouston.com/bio-press-photos|title=Reggie Houston – Bio & Press Photos|website=reggiehouston.com|access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref> [[Lee Allen (musician)|Lee Allen]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offbeat.com/articles/masters-of-louisiana-music-lee-allen/|title=Masters of Louisiana Music: Lee Allen – OffBeat Magazine|date=December 2000 |access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref> and Fred Kemp, Domino's trusted bandleader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ioldies.com/lifestyle_artists/1369/Artists_-_Fats_Domino.html|title=Classic Music Hits and Artists – I Oldies Music Store|website=iOldies Music Store|access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref>[[Image:Fats Domino 1956.png|thumb|upright|Domino singing "[[Blueberry Hill]]" on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1956]]

While Domino's own recordings were done for Imperial, he sometimes sat in during that time as a session musician on recordings by other artists for other record labels. Domino's rolling piano triplets provided the memorable instrumental introduction for [[Lloyd Price]]'s first hit, "[[Lawdy Miss Clawdy]]", recorded for [[Specialty Records]] on March 13, 1952, at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s [[J&M Recording Studios]] in New Orleans (where Domino himself had earlier recorded "The Fat Man" and other songs). Dave Bartholomew was producing Price's record, which also featured familiar Domino collaborators Hardesty, Fields and Palmer as sidemen, and he asked Domino to play the piano part, replacing the original session pianist.<ref>Coleman (2006). pp. 72–74.</ref>

Domino crossed into the [[popular music|pop]] mainstream with "[[Ain't That a Shame]]" (mislabeled as "Ain't It a Shame") which reached the Top Ten. This was the first of his records to appear on the Billboard pop singles chart (on July 16, 1955), with the debut at number 14.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/pro/fats-dominos-biggest-billboard-hits-from-aint-that-a-shame-to/|title=Fats Domino's Biggest Billboard Hits: From 'Ain't That a Shame' to 'Blueberry Hill' & More|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=October 29, 2017}}</ref> A milder cover version by [[Pat Boone]] reached number 1,<ref name=pc6>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19752/m1/|title=Show 6&nbsp;– Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll: The Rock Revolution Gets Underway.

In 1955, Domino was said to be earning $10,000 a week while touring, according to a report in [[Chuck Berry]]'s memoir. Domino eventually had 37 [[Top 40]] singles, but none made it to number 1 on the Pop chart.<ref name="Rolling Stone death" />

Domino's debut album contained several of his recent hits and earlier blues tracks that had not been released as singles, and was issued on the Imperial label (catalogue number 9009) in November 1955, and was reissued as ''[[Rock and Rollin' with Fats Domino]]''.<ref name=discog>{{cite book|last=Strong|first=Martin C.|title=The Great Rock Discography: Complete Discographies Listing Every Track Recorded by More Than 1,200 Artists|publisher=Canongate U.S.|year=2004|page=434|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_WoRAPJQ58sC&q=%22Fats+Domino%22+album+discography&pg=PA436|isbn=1841956155}}</ref> The reissue reached number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Pop Albums]] chart.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r35710/charts-awards|label=Rock and Rollin' with Fats Domino Billboard Albums|access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref>

Domino appeared in two films released in 1956: ''[[Shake, Rattle & Rock!

On November 2, 1956, a riot broke out at a Domino concert in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]]. The police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd. Domino jumped out a window to avoid the melee; he and two members of his band were slightly injured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/oldieshistory/a/november2.htm|title=Oldies Music|website=About.com|access-date=April 26, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003104919/http://oldies.about.com/od/oldieshistory/a/november2.htm|archive-date=October 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> During his career, four major riots occurred at his concerts, "partly because of integration", according to his biographer Rick Coleman. "But also the fact they had alcohol at these shows. So they were mixing alcohol, plus dancing, plus the races together for the first time in a lot of these places."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/feb/26/american-masters-fats-domino-and-birth-rock-n-roll/|title=AMERICAN MASTERS: Fats Domino And The Birth Of Rock 'n' Roll|first=Jennifer|last=Robinson|date=February 26, 2016 |publisher=kpbs.org|access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref> In August 1957, he was banned from performing at [[Griffith Stadium]] in Washington, DC due to security concerns raised by city commissioner Robert McLaughlin.<ref>{{Cite web |last=ghostsofdc |date=October 2, 2012 |title=Rowdy Rock 'n' Roll: Fats Domino Banned From Griffith Stadium |url=https://ghostsofdc.org/2012/10/02/rowdy-rock-n-roll-fats-domino-banned-from-griffith-stadium/ |access-date=January 21, 2023 |website=Ghosts of DC |language=en-US}}</ref>

In November 1957, Domino appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''; no disturbance accompanied this performance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Icons of R & B and soul: an encyclopedia of the artists who revolutionized rhythm|last=Gulla|first=Bob|date=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313340444|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=61|oclc=230807722}}</ref>

In the same year, the article "King of Rock 'n' Roll" in ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine featured Domino who said he was on the road 340 days a year, up to $2,500 per evening, and grossing over $500,000; Domino also told readers that he owned 50 suits, 100 pairs of shoes and a $1,500 diamond horseshoe stick pin.<ref name="PBSexcerpt" />

Domino had a steady series of hits for Imperial through early 1962, including "Walking to New Orleans" (1960, Pop number 6), co-written by [[Bobby Charles]], and "[[My Girl Josephine]]" (Pop number 14) in the same year. He toured Europe in 1962 and met the Beatles who would later cite Domino as an inspiration.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/obituaries/fats-domino-89-one-of-rock-n-rolls-first-stars-is-dead.html|title=Fats Domino, Early Rock 'n' Roller With a Boogie-Woogie Piano, Is Dead at 89|first1=Jon|last1=Pareles|first2=William|last2=Grimes|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 25, 2017 |access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref> After returning, he played the first of his many stands in Las Vegas.<ref name="PBStimeline" />

"I stuck with them until they sold out," he said in 1979. In all, he recorded over 60 singles for Imperial, placing 40 songs in the top 10 on the R&B chart and 11 in the top 10 on the Pop chart, twenty-seven of which were double-sided hits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncamarvy.com/FatsDomino/fatsdomino.html|title=Fats Domino The Imperial Years|first=Marv|last=Goldberg|publisher=Unca Marvy's R&B Page |access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref>

===Recordings after leaving Imperial (1963–1970s)===
[[File:Fats Domino Hamburg 1973 1605730021.jpg|thumb|upright|Domino in 1972 |left]]
Domino moved to [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount Records]] in 1963. The label dictated that he record in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], rather than New Orleans. He was assigned a new producer ([[Felton Jarvis]]) and a new arranger ([[Bill Justis]]). Domino's long-term collaboration with the producer, arranger, and frequent co-writer [[Dave Bartholomew]], who oversaw virtually all of his Imperial hits,<ref name="rockhall"/> was seemingly at an end. Jarvis and Justis changed the Domino sound somewhat, notably by adding the backing of a [[Nashville sound#Countrypolitan|countrypolitan]]-style vocal chorus to most of his new recordings. He released 11 singles for ABC-Paramount, several which hit the Top 100 but just once entering the Top 40 ([[Red Sails in the Sunset (song)|"Red Sails in the Sunset"]], 1963). By the end of 1964 the [[British Invasion]] had changed the tastes of the record-buying public, and Domino's chart run was over.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/fats-is-back-mw0000237013|title=Fats is Back – Fats Domino|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=AllMusic|access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref>

Despite the lack of chart success, Domino continued to record steadily until about 1970, leaving ABC-Paramount in mid-1965 and recording for [[Mercury Records]], where he delivered a live album ''[[Fats Domino '65]]'' and two singles. A studio album was planned but stalled with just four tracks recorded. Dave Bartholomew's small Broadmoor label (reuniting with Bartholomew along the way), featured many contemporary Soul infused sides and a few single releases but an album was not released overseas until 1971 to fulfill his [[Reprise Records]] contract. He shifted to that label after Broadmoor and had a Top 100 single, a cover of [[the Beatles]]' "[[Lady Madonna]]".<ref name="auto" />

Domino appeared in the [[The Monkees|Monkees]]' television special ''[[33⅓ Revolutions per Monkee]]'' filmed in December 1968 and aired in April 1969. In 1971, he opened for [[Ike & Tina Turner]] at [[Carnegie Hall]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=April 17, 1971|title=Ike & Tina Turner, Fats Domino|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wgEAAAAMBAJ&q=1971+ike+tina+fats+domino+billboard&pg=PA20|magazine=Billboard|pages=20}}</ref> He continued to be popular as a performer for several decades.

Domino lived in a mansion in a predominantly [[Working class|working-class]] neighborhood in the [[Lower Ninth Ward]], where he was a familiar sight in his bright pink [[Cadillac]] automobile. He made yearly appearances at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]] and other local events.

His last tour was in Europe, for three weeks in 1995.<ref>Spera, Keith (2011). ''Groove Interrupted''.

===Domino and Hurricane Katrina===
[[Image:RIPFatsYouWillBeMissedLow9.jpg|thumb|Graffiti on Domino's home from the time he was rumored dead in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] (2005)]]As [[Hurricane Katrina]] approached New Orleans in August 2005, Domino chose to stay at home with his family, partly because his wife, Rosemary, was in poor health. His house was in an area that was heavily flooded.[[Image:FatsDomino-office (cropped).jpg|thumb|Domino's office, June 2007]]

Domino was rumored to have died in the hurricane,<ref name="Washington Post"/> and his home was vandalized when someone spray-painted the message "RIP Fats. You will be missed". On September 1, the talent agent Al Embry announced that he had not heard from Domino since before the hurricane struck. Later that day, [[CNN]] reported that Domino had been rescued by a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] helicopter. Until then, even family members had not heard from him since before the storm.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fats Domino found OK in New Orleans|url=https://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/01/katrina.fats.domino/index.html|website=[[CNN]]|date=September 1, 2005|accessdate=July 3, 2022}}</ref> Embry confirmed that Domino and his family had been rescued. The family was then taken to a shelter in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], after which they were picked up by [[JaMarcus Russell]], the starting quarterback of the [[Louisiana State University]] football team, and the boyfriend of Domino's granddaughter. He let the family stay in his apartment. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that on September 2, they had left Russell's apartment after sleeping three nights on the couch. "We've lost everything," Domino said, according to the ''Post''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Eli|last=Saslow|date=September 2, 2005|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/02/AR2005090201578.html|title=Music Legend 'Fats' Domino Coping with Katrina|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=November 1, 2006}}</ref>

By January 2006, work to gut and repair Domino's home and office had begun (see [[Reconstruction of New Orleans]]). In the meantime, the Domino family resided in [[Harvey, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Fats Domino dies at 89; gave rock music a New Orleans flavor|url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/article180776661.html|access-date=October 26, 2017|newspaper=[[Kansas City Star]]|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref>

==Influence and legacy==
Domino was one of the biggest stars of rock and roll in the 1950s, but he was not convinced that this was a new genre. In 1957, Domino said: "What they call rock 'n' roll now is rhythm and blues. I've been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/paul-mccartney-remembers-truly-magnificent-fats-domino-128449/|title=Paul McCartney Remembers 'Truly Magnificent' Fats Domino|first=Elias|last=Leight|website=Rollingstone.com|date=October 26, 2017|access-date=March 15, 2021}}</ref> According to ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', "this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-50s-a-decade-of-music-that-changed-the-world-229924/|title=The 50s: A Decade of Music That Changed the World|first=Robert|last=Palmer|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=April 19, 1990|access-date=March 15, 2021}}</ref>

He was among the first R&B artists to gain popularity with white audiences. His biographer Rick Coleman argues that Domino's records and tours with rock and roll shows in that decade, bringing together Black and White youths in a shared appreciation of his music, was a factor in the breakdown of [[racial segregation in the United States]].<ref>Coleman (2006) pp. xviii, 11–12</ref> Domino himself did not define his work as rock and roll, saying, "It wasn't anything but the same rhythm and blues I'd been playin' down in New Orleans."<ref name="rockhall"/>

Both [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] recorded Domino songs. According to some reports, McCartney wrote the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Lady Madonna]]" in emulation of Domino's style,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/25/entertainment/fats-domino-obituary/index.html|title=Fats Domino dead at 89, medical examiner's office says|first=Todd |last=Leopold|date=October 25, 2017|publisher=CNN}}</ref> combining it with a nod to [[Humphrey Lyttelton]]'s 1956 hit "[[Bad Penny Blues]]". Domino recorded his own version of "Lady Madonna" in 1968,<ref name="Rolling Stone death" /> which became his final single to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="book1">{{cite book|last1=Otfinoski|first1=Steven|title=African Americans in the Performing Arts|date=2010|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-1438128559|page=60}}</ref> That recording, as well as covers of two other songs by the Beatles, appeared on his Reprise album ''Fats Is Back'', produced by [[Richard Perry]] and with several hits recorded by a band that included the New Orleans pianist [[James Booker]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oliver-Goodwin|first1=Michael|title=Heaven Before I Die: A Journey to the Heart of New Orleans|date=2010|publisher=Black Shadow Press|location=Oakland, California|isbn=9780557394586|page=215}}</ref> McCartney later recorded "Ain't That a Shame", "[[I'm in Love Again (song)|I'm in Love Again]]" and "[[I'm Gonna Be a Wheel Someday]]" for his 1988 album ''[[CHOBA B CCCP]]''.

Domino was present in the audience of 2,200 people at [[Elvis Presley]]'s first concert at the [[Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino|Las Vegas Hilton]] on July 31, 1969. At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to Presley as "The King", Presley gestured toward Domino, who was taking in the scene. "No," Presley said, "that's the real king of rock and roll."<ref>{{cite web|last=Cook |first=Jody |date=May 27, 2004 |title=Graceland National Historic Landmark Nomination Form |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset?assetID=5db64e4b-7360-4b57-9d04-fae564edd7fc |format=PDF

Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that."

According to [[Richie Unterberger]], writing for [[AllMusic]], Domino was one of the most consistent artists of early [[rock music]], the best-selling African-American rock-and-roll star of the 1950s, and the most popular singer of the "classic" [[New Orleans rhythm and blues]] style. His million-selling debut single, "The Fat Man" (1949), is one of many that have been cited as [[Origins of rock and roll|the first rock and roll record]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|author-link=Richie Unterberger|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fats-domino-mn0000137494/biography|title=Fats Domino|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 2, 2015}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]] wrote that Domino was "the most widely liked rock and roller of the '50s" and remarked on his influence:

{{blockquote|Warm and unthreatening even by the intensely congenial standards of New Orleans, he's remembered with fond condescension as significantly less innovative than his uncommercial compatriots [[Professor Longhair]] and [[James Booker]]. But though his bouncy boogie-woogie piano and easy Creole gait were generically Ninth Ward, they defined a pop-friendly second-line beat that nobody knew was there before he and [[Dave Bartholomew]] created 'The Fat Man' in 1949. In short, this shy, deferential, uncharismatic man invented New Orleans rock and roll.<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=December 25, 1990|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv1290-90.php|title=Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=September 2, 2015}}</ref>}}

Domino's rhythm, accentuating the [[Beat (music)#On-beat and off-beat|offbeat]], as in the song "Be My Guest", was an influence on ska music.<ref>Coleman (2006), p. 210</ref>
