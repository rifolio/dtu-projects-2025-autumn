'''The Beach Boys''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Hawthorne, California]], in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], and [[Carl Wilson]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and their friend [[Al Jardine]]. Distinguished by their [[vocal harmonies]], adolescent-oriented lyrics, and musical ingenuity, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. The group drew on the music of [[Traditional pop|older pop]] [[vocal group]]s, 1950s [[rock and roll]], and black<!--- Quote from Geoffrey Himes: "black R&B was crucial to their sound." There is a notable distinction between the "white" and "black" R&B records of the 1950s, as explained by Carl Wilson: "The black artists were so much better in terms of rock records in those days that the white records almost sounded like put-ons." ---> [[R&B]] to create their unique sound. Under Brian's direction, they often incorporated [[classical music|classical]] or [[jazz]] elements and [[Recording studio as an instrument|unconventional recording techniques]] in innovative ways.

They formed as a [[garage band]] centered on Brian's songwriting and managed by the Wilsons' father, [[Murry Wilson|Murry]]. Jardine was briefly replaced by [[David Marks]] during 1962–1963. In 1962, they enjoyed their first national hit with "[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]", beginning a [[The Beach Boys discography#1960s|string of hit singles]] that reflected a [[southern California]] [[youth culture]] of [[surfing]], cars, and romance, dubbed the "[[California sound]]". They were one of the few American rock bands to sustain their commercial standing during the [[British Invasion]]. 1965 saw the addition of [[Bruce Johnston]] to the band, as well as Brian's move away from beach-going themes for more introspective lyrics and ambitious studio productions. In 1966, the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and "[[Good Vibrations]]" single raised the group's prestige as rock innovators; both are now widely considered to be among the greatest and most influential works in [[popular music]] history.

After shelving the ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' album in 1967, Brian gradually ceded control of the group to his bandmates. In the late 1960s, the group's commercial momentum faltered in the U.S., and they were widely dismissed by the [[Music journalism#20th century rock criticism|early rock music press]]. Rebranding themselves in the early 1970s, [[Blondie Chaplin]] and [[Ricky Fataar]] of [[the Flames]] briefly joined their lineup while Johnston had left the band before rejoining in the late-1970s. Carl took over as ''[[de facto]]'' leader until the mid-1970s, when the band responded to the growing success of their live shows and [[greatest hits]] compilations by becoming an [[oldies]] act. Dennis drowned in 1983, and Brian became estranged from the group in 1990s. Following Carl's death from lung cancer in 1998, Jardine left the band while Love was granted legal rights to [[The Beach Boys (touring band)|tour under the group's name]] and continued performing with Johnston and Marks, who had briefly rejoined from 1997 to 1999. In the early 2010s, the surviving original members, alongside Marks and Johnston, temporarily reunited for the band's [[The 50th Reunion Tour|50th anniversary tour]]. Brian died in 2025 of respiratory arrest.

The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed and [[List of best-selling music artists|commercially successful bands]] of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide. They helped legitimize popular music as a recognized art form, and influenced the development of music genres and movements such as [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], [[power pop]], [[progressive rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[Alternative rock|alternative]], and [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]]. Between the 1960s and 2020s, the group had 37 songs reach the U.S. [[Top 40]] of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (the most by an American band), with four topping the chart. In 2004, the group was ranked number 12 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|greatest artists of all time]]. Many critics' polls have ranked ''[[The Beach Boys Today!]]'' (1965), ''Pet Sounds'', ''[[Smiley Smile]]'', ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'' (both 1967), ''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' (1970), and ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'' (1971) among the finest albums in history. The founding members were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988.

===1958–1961: Formation===
[[File:Beach Boys Landmark - Plano general I.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beach Boys Historic Landmark|Historical landmark in Hawthorne, California]], marking where the Wilson family home once stood]]
At the time of his 16th birthday on June 20, 1958, [[Brian Wilson]] shared a bedroom with his brothers, [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson|Carl]]{{mdash}}aged 13 and 11, respectively{{mdash}}in their family home in [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]]. He had watched his father [[Murry Wilson]] play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as [[the Four Freshmen]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} After dissecting songs such as "[[Ivory Tower (1956 song)|Ivory Tower]]" and "[[Good News (musical)|Good News]]", Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=12}} For his birthday that year, Brian received a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]]. He learned how to [[overdub]], using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} Brian played piano, while Carl and [[David Marks]], an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, played guitars that each had received as Christmas presents.{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=1}}

Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to [[Johnny Otis]]' [[KFRN|KFOX]] radio show.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the [[rhythm and blues]] songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin [[Mike Love]]. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} Later, Brian, Carl, Love and two friends performed at [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]] under the name "Carl and The Passions".{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=5}} Brian also knew [[Al Jardine]], a high school classmate.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=103}} Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. Soon after Dennis also joined the band on demand of the Wilson's mother Audree. Love gave the fledgling band its name: "The Pendletones", a pun on "[[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]]", a brand of woolen shirt popular among local surfers at the time.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=21}} Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group, and he suggested that the group write songs that celebrated the sport and the lifestyle that it had inspired in [[Southern California]].{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=104}}{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}}{{refn|group=nb|Nick Venet said that none of the members, including Dennis, surfed until after the fact.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=60}}}} Brian finished the song, titled "[[Surfin'|Surfin{{'-}}]]", and with Mike Love, wrote "[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]".{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}}

Murry Wilson, who was an occasional songwriter, arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher Hite Morgan.<ref name=RockHallofFame /> He said: "Finally, [Hite] agreed to hear it, and Mrs. Morgan said 'Drop everything, we're going to record your song. I think it's good.' And she's the one responsible."{{sfn|Murphy|2015|p=99}} On September 15, 1961, the band recorded a demo of "Surfin{{'"}} with the Morgans. A more professional recording was made on October 3, at World Pacific Studio in Hollywood.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=104}} David Marks was not present at the session as he was in school that day.<ref>{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Andy |title=Exclusive QA: Original Beach Boy David Marks on the Band's Anniversary Tour |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-q-a-original-beach-boy-david-marks-on-the-bands-anniversary-tour-20120316 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 16, 2012 |access-date=February 19, 2013 |archive-date=February 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202174751/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-q-a-original-beach-boy-david-marks-on-the-bands-anniversary-tour-20120316 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Since he did not appear on the first performance by the band that would become "the Beach Boys", most historians discount him as a true founding member of the group.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}}}} Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of [[Candix Records]] and [[Era Records]], and he signed the group on December 8.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}} When the single was released a few weeks later, the band found that they had been renamed "the Beach Boys".{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=104}} Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers until [[Russ Regan]], a young promoter with Era Records, noted that there already existed a group by that name. He suggested calling them the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Murphy|2015|p=117}} "Surfin{{'"}} was a regional success for the West Coast, and reached number 75 on the national [[Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.

===1962–1967: Peak years===

====Signing to Capitol Records====

[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg|thumb|right|The Beach Boys, in [[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]] outfits, performing at a local high school, late 1962]]
By this time the de facto manager of the Beach Boys, Murry landed the group's first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]].{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}} In their early public appearances, the band wore the heavy Pendleton woolen jacket-like shirts that local surfers favored{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=19}} before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants (a look that was taken directly from the [[Kingston Trio]]).{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=187}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=106}} All five members sang, with Brian playing bass, Dennis playing drums, Carl playing lead guitar, and Al Jardine playing rhythm guitar, while Mike Love was the main singer and occasionally played saxophone. In early 1962, Morgan requested that some of the members add vocals to a couple of instrumental tracks that he had recorded with other musicians. This led to the creation of the short-lived group Kenny & the Cadets, which Brian led under the pseudonym "Kenny". The other members were Carl, Jardine, and the Wilsons' mother Audree.<ref name="Kenny"/>{{refn|group=nb|The only songs the group recorded were two Morgan compositions "Barbie" and "What Is a Young Girl Made Of?"<ref name="Kenny">{{cite web|author-link=Richie Unterberger|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Kenny & the Cadets|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kenny-the-cadets-mn0000070397|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=April 21, 2020|archive-date=June 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200618221231/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kenny-the-cadets-mn0000070397|url-status=live}}</ref>}} In February, Jardine left the Beach Boys and was replaced by David Marks on rhythm guitar.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=105}} A common misconception is that Jardine left to focus on [[dental school]]. In reality, Jardine did not even apply to dental school until 1964, and the reason he left in February 1962 was due to creative differences and his belief that the newly-formed group would not be a commercial success.{{sfn|Murphy|2015|p=151}}

After being turned down by [[Dot Records|Dot]] and [[Liberty Records|Liberty]], the Beach Boys signed a seven-year contract with [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="photobucket13">{{cite magazine|url=http://i351.photobucket.com/albums/q476/marcus1970/hit%20parader%201966/HitParaderp6October1966.jpg|title=The Beach Boy Empire|last=Taylor|first=Derek|date=October 5, 1966|magazine=Hit Parader|page=13|author-link=Derek Taylor|access-date=June 29, 2013|archive-date=May 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525143421/http://i351.photobucket.com/albums/q476/marcus1970/hit%20parader%201966/HitParaderp6October1966.jpg|url-status=live}}</ref> This was at the urging of Capitol executive and staff producer [[Nick Venet]] who signed the group, seeing them as the "teenage gold" he had been scouting for.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=62}} On June 4, 1962, the Beach Boys debuted on Capitol with their second single, "Surfin' Safari" backed with "409". The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'', which praised Love's lead vocal and said the song had potential.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=June 9, 1962 |title=Reviews of New Singles |magazine=Billboard Magazine |volume= 74 |issue= 23 |page=40  |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ|page=4}} |access-date=April 27, 2013}}</ref> "Surfin' Safari" rose to number 14 and found airplay in New York and Phoenix, a surprise for the label.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=105}}

====First studio albums====

The Beach Boys' debut album, ''[[Surfin' Safari]]'', was released in October 1962. It was different from other rock albums of the time in that it consisted almost entirely of original songs, primarily written by Brian with Mike Love and friend [[Gary Usher]].{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=105}} Another unusual feature of the Beach Boys was that, although they were marketed as "surf music", their repertoire bore little resemblance to the music of other surf bands, which was mainly instrumental and incorporated heavy use of [[spring reverb]]. For this reason, some of the Beach Boys' early local performances had young audience members throwing vegetables at the band, believing that the group were poseurs.<ref name="Emami">{{cite news |last1=Emami |first1=Gazelle |title=Surf Music Evolution: From The Beach Boys To Punk |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/surf-music-evolution_n_3322063 |work=[[HuffPost]] |date=December 6, 2017 |access-date=May 2, 2020 |archive-date=June 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200619021802/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/surf-music-evolution_n_3322063 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten single, "[[Surfin' U.S.A.]]", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts. It was during the sessions for this single that Brian made the production decision from that point on to use [[double tracking]] on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=32}} The [[Surfin' U.S.A. (album)|album of the same name]] followed in March and reached number 2 on the ''Billboard'' charts.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=35}} Its success propelled the group into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze,{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=71}} albeit the Beach Boys' vocal approach to the genre, not the original instrumental style pioneered by [[Dick Dale]].<ref name="Emami"/> Biographer Luis Sanchez highlights the "Surfin' U.S.A." single as a turning point for the band, "creat[ing] a direct passage to California life for a wide teenage audience&nbsp;... [and] a distinct Southern California sensibility that exceeded its conception as such to advance right to the front of American consciousness".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=10, 13}} Jardine returned in spring 1963 so Brian could make fewer touring appearances. Issues between Marks, his parents, and manager/the Wilsons' father Murry led Marks to quit in October 1963.

''[[Surfer Girl]]'' marked the first time the group used outside musicians on a substantial portion of an LP.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=107}} Many of them were the musicians Spector used for his [[Wall of Sound]] productions.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=111}} Only a month after ''Surfer Girl'''s release the group's fourth album ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'' was issued. To close 1963, the band released a standalone Christmas-themed single "[[Little Saint Nick]]", backed with an [[a cappella]] rendition of the [[Lord's Prayer|scriptural]] song "[[The Lord's Prayer (1935 song)|The Lord's Prayer]]". The A-side peaked at number 3 on the US ''Billboard'' Christmas chart.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=45}}

====Reaction to British Invasion====
[[File:Sullivan Beach Boys.jpg|thumb|right|The band performing "[[I Get Around]]" on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in September 1964 ]]

The surf music craze, along with the careers of nearly all surf acts, was slowly replaced by the [[British Invasion]].{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|pp=1313–1314}} Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the Beach Boys returned home to face their new competition, [[the Beatles]]. Both groups shared the same record label in the US, and Capitol's support for the Beach Boys immediately began waning. Although it generated a top-five single in "[[Fun Fun Fun]]", the group's fifth album, ''[[Shut Down Volume 2]]'', became their first since ''Surfin' Safari'' not to reach the US top-ten. This caused Murry to fight for the band at the label more than before, often visiting their offices without warning to "twist executive arms".{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=50}} Carl said that Phil Spector "was Brian's favorite kind of rock; he liked [him] better than the early Beatles stuff. He loved the Beatles' later music when they evolved and started making intelligent, masterful music, but before that Phil was it."<ref name=HimesSurf/> According to Mike Love, Carl followed the Beatles more closely than anyone else in the band, while Brian was the most "rattled" by the Beatles and felt tremendous pressure to "keep pace" with them.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=88, 104, 184}} For Brian, the Beatles ultimately "eclipsed a lot [of what] we'd worked for&nbsp;... [they] eclipsed the whole music world".{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=52}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=70}}{{refn|group=nb|He remembered "flipping out [over the Beatles]. I couldn't understand how a group could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, '[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but the[ir fans] just screamed at it.&nbsp;... It got us off our asses in the studio. [We] said 'look, don't worry about the Beatles, we'll cut our own stuff'."<ref>{{cite AV media|people=[[David Espar|Espar, David]], [[Robert Levi|Levi, Robert]] (Directors)|year=1995|title=Rock & Roll|medium=[[Miniseries]]}}</ref> He recalled that he and Love immediately felt threatened by the Beatles, believing that the Beach Boys could never match the excitement created by the Beatles as performers, and that this realization led him to concentrate his efforts on trying to outdo them in the recording studio.<ref name="MSLE">{{cite book |year=2002 |title=Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days That Shook the World (The Psychedelic Beatles – April 1, 1965 to December 26, 1967)|title-link=Mojo (magazine)#Special editions|location=London |publisher=Emap|page=4}}</ref>}}[[File:The Beach Boys (1965).png|thumb|left|The Beach Boys in 1964; clockwise from top left: [[Mike Love]], [[Brian Wilson]], [[Carl Wilson]], [[Dennis Wilson]], [[Al Jardine]]]]

Brian wrote his last surf song for nearly four years, "[[Don't Back Down]]", in April 1964.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=51}} That month, during recording of the single "[[I Get Around]]", the band dismissed Murry as their manager. He remained in close contact with the group, offering unsolicited advice on their business decisions.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=112–113}} When "I Get Around" was released in May, it would climb to number 1 in the US and Canada, their first single to do so (also reaching the top-ten in Sweden and the UK), proving that the Beach Boys could compete with contemporary British pop groups.{{sfn|Moskowitz|2015|p=42}} "I Get Around" and "Don't Back Down" both appeared on the band's sixth album ''[[All Summer Long (album)|All Summer Long]]'', released in July 1964 and reaching number 4 in the US. ''All Summer Long'' introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys' sound exemplified by the [[piccolo]]s and [[xylophone]]s of [[All Summer Long (The Beach Boys song)|its title track]].{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=110}} The album was a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon. Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|pp=72–73}} Before this, a live album, ''[[Beach Boys Concert]]'', was released in October to a four-week chart stay at number 1, containing a set list of previously recorded songs and covers that they had not yet recorded.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}

In June 1964, Brian recorded the bulk of ''[[The Beach Boys' Christmas Album]]'' with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with [[The Four Freshmen|Four Freshmen]] arranger [[Dick Reynolds (musician)|Dick Reynolds]]. The album was a response to Phil Spector's ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector|A Christmas Gift for You]]'' (1963). Released in December, the Beach Boys' album was divided between five new, original Christmas-themed songs, and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=59–60}} It would be regarded as one of the finest [[holiday album]]s of the rock era.{{sfn|Moskowitz|2015|p=42}} One single from the album, "[[The Man with All the Toys]]", was released, peaking at number 6 on the US ''Billboard'' Christmas chart.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=75}} On October 29, the Beach Boys performed for ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]'', a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of musicians for a one-off performance. The result was released to movie theaters one month later.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=30–31}}

====Artistic growth in 1965====

[[File:The Beach Boys 1964 Billboard.png|thumb|right|The band with caricatures in Paris, November 1964]]
By the end of 1964, the stress of road travel, writing, and producing became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a [[panic attack]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=63–64}} In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the last few days of 1964 and into early 1965, session musician and up-and-coming solo artist [[Glen Campbell]] agreed to temporarily serve as Brian's replacement in concert.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=77, 79}} Carl took over as the band's musical director onstage.<ref name="Jarnow15" />{{refn|group=nb|Contracts at that time stipulated that promoters hire "Carl Wilson plus four other musicians".<ref name="Jarnow15" /> Additionally, in February, July, and October, Brian rejoined the live group for one-off occasions.<ref name=GIGS65>{{cite web|last1=Doe|first1=Andrew G.

Released in March 1965, ''[[The Beach Boys Today!]]'' marked the first time the group experimented with the "album-as-art" form. Music writer Scott Schinder referenced its "[[suite (music)|suite-like structure]]" as an early example of the [[Album Era|rock album format]] being used to make a cohesive artistic statement.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=111}} Brian also established his new lyrical approach toward the autobiographical; journalist [[Nick Kent]] wrote that the subjects of Brian's songs "were suddenly no longer simple happy souls harmonizing their sun-kissed innocence and dying devotion to each other over a honey-coated backdrop of surf and sand".{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=13}} In the book ''Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop'', [[Bob Stanley (musician)|Bob Stanley]] remarked that "Brian was aiming for [[Johnny Mercer]] but coming up [[indie rock|proto-indie]]."{{sfn|Stanley|2013|pp=219–220}} In 2012, the album was voted 271 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-beach-boys-the-beach-boys-today-20120524 |title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: The Beach Boys, 'The Beach Boys Today' |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=May 31, 2012 |access-date=August 12, 2012 |archive-date=October 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022163036/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-beach-boys-the-beach-boys-today-20120524 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In April 1965, Campbell's own career success pulled him from touring with the group.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=86}} [[Columbia Records]] staff producer [[Bruce Johnston]] was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965. With Johnston's arrival, Brian now had a sixth voice he could work with in the band's vocal arrangements, with the June 4 vocal sessions for "[[California Girls]]" being Johnston's first recording session with the Beach Boys. "California Girls" was included on the band's next album ''[[Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)]]''. The first single from ''Summer Days'' had been a reworked arrangement of "[[Help Me, Rhonda]]", which became the band's second number 1 US single in the spring of 1965.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=111–112}} To appease Capitol's demands for a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, Brian conceived ''[[Beach Boys' Party!]]'', a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]", and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier songs.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=71}} The album was an early precursor of the "[[MTV Unplugged|unplugged]]" trend. It also included a cover of [[The Regents (doo-wop band)|the Regents]]' song "[[Barbara Ann]]", which unexpectedly reached number 2 when released as a single several weeks later.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=113}} In November, the group released another top-twenty single, "[[The Little Girl I Once Knew]]". It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}

For ''Pet Sounds'', Brian desired to make "a complete statement", similar to what he believed the Beatles had done with their newest album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', released in December 1965.{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=44}} Brian was immediately enamored with the album, given the impression that it had no [[Filler (media)|filler tracks]], a feature that was mostly unheard of at a time when 45&nbsp;rpm singles were considered more noteworthy than full-length LPs.{{sfn|Fusilli|2005|p=80}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=114}} He later said: "It didn't make me want to copy them but to be as good as them.

Released on May 16, 1966, ''Pet Sounds'' was widely influential and raised the band's prestige as an innovative rock group.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}} Early reviews for the album in the US ranged from negative to tentatively positive, and its sales numbered approximately 500,000 units, a drop-off from the run of albums that immediately preceded it.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=85}} It was assumed that Capitol considered ''Pet Sounds'' a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience upon which the Beach Boys had built their commercial standing.{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=47}} Within two months, the label capitulated by releasing the group's first [[greatest hits]] compilation album, ''[[Best of the Beach Boys]]'', which was quickly certified gold by the [[RIAA]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=85–86}} By contrast, ''Pet Sounds'' met a highly favorable critical response in Britain, where it reached number 2 and remained among the top-ten positions for six months.{{sfn|Gillett|1984|p=329}} Responding to the hype, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' ran a feature in which many pop musicians were asked whether they believed that the album was truly revolutionary and [[progressive music|progressive]], or "as sickly as peanut butter".

===="Good Vibrations" and ''Smile''====

[[File:The Beach Boys September 16 1967 Billboard.png|thumb|The Beach Boys accepting a gold record sales certification for "[[Good Vibrations]]" at the [[Capitol Tower]], late 1966]]

Throughout the summer of 1966, Brian concentrated on finishing the group's next single, "[[Good Vibrations]]".{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=5}} Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, he recorded short interchangeable fragments. Through [[tape splicing]], each fragment could be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing larger structures and divergent moods to be produced later.<ref name="ARP"/> Pop singles were usually recorded in under two hours at that time, so it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, with sessions for the song stretching over months in four major Hollywood studios. It was the most expensive single then ever recorded, with production costs estimated to be tens of thousands.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41–46}}

In the midst of "Good Vibrations" sessions, Wilson invited session musician and songwriter [[Van Dyke Parks]] to collaborate as lyricist for the Beach Boys' next album project, soon titled ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=129}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=114}} Wilson and Parks intended ''Smile'' to be a continuous suite of songs linked thematically and musically, with the main songs linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated on the major songs' musical themes.{{sfn|Williams|2010|pp=94–98}} It was explicitly American in style and subject, a conscious reaction to the overwhelming British dominance of popular music .{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=94}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=117}} Some of the music incorporated chanting, cowboy songs, explorations in Indian and Hawaiian music, jazz, classical [[tone poem]]s, cartoon sound effects, ''[[musique concrète]]'', and yodeling.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Sean|title=The Once and Future King: 'SMiLE' and Brian Wilson's Very American Dream|url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/161935-the-once-and-future-king-smile-and-brian-wilsons-very-american-dream/|website=Popmatters|access-date=July 17, 2014|date=August 28, 2012|archive-date=July 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728143335/http://www.popmatters.com/feature/161935-the-once-and-future-king-smile-and-brian-wilsons-very-american-dream/|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' writer [[Jules Siegel]] recalled that, on one October evening, Brian announced to his wife and friends that he was "writing a teenage symphony to God".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=101}}

Recording for ''Smile'' lasted from mid-1966 to mid-1967, and followed the same modular production approach as "Good Vibrations".{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=390}} Concurrently, Wilson planned different multimedia side projects, such as a sound effects collage, a comedy album, and a "health food" album.<ref name="Nolan1971">{{cite magazine|last=Nolan|first=Tom|title=The Beach Boys: A California Saga|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 28, 1971|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-beach-boys-a-california-saga-19711028|issue=94|access-date=May 13, 2018|archive-date=July 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718092340/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-beach-boys-a-california-saga-19711028|url-status=dead}}</ref> Capitol did not support all these, which led to the Beach Boys' desire to form their own label, [[Brother Records]]. Wilson employed his newfound "best friend" [[David Anderle]] as head of the label.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=164}} Released on October 10, 1966, "Good Vibrations" was the Beach Boys' third US number 1 single, reaching the top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in December, and became their first number 1 in Britain.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=155–156}} The record was their first single certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=86}} It came to be widely acclaimed as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}} In December, the Beach Boys were voted the top band in the world in the ''NME''{{'}}s annual readers' poll, ahead of the Beatles, [[the Walker Brothers]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[the Four Tops]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=86–87}}

Throughout the first half of 1967, the release date for ''Smile'' was repeatedly postponed as Brian tinkered with the recordings, experimenting with different takes and mixes, and appeared unwilling to supply finished versions of songs. Meanwhile, he began to suffer from delusions and paranoia, believing on one occasion that the would-be album track "[[The Elements: Fire|Fire]]" caused a building to burn down.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=118}} On January 3, 1967, Carl Wilson refused to be drafted for military service, leading to indictment and criminal prosecution, which he challenged as a [[conscientious objector]].<ref name="CW">{{cite web |url=http://reasonabledoubt.org/index.php/criminallawblog/entry/january-3-1967-beach-boy-carl-wilson-becomes-draft-dodger-today-in-crime-history |title=January 3, 1967, Beach Boy Carl Wilson Becomes a Draft Dodger – Today in Crime History |last=Buchanan |first=Michael |date=January 2, 2012 |access-date=August 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225084530/http://reasonabledoubt.org/index.php/criminallawblog/entry/january-3-1967-beach-boy-carl-wilson-becomes-draft-dodger-today-in-crime-history |archive-date=February 25, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The FBI arrested him in April,{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=100}} and it took years for courts to resolve the matter.<ref name="MF1976">{{cite magazine|title=The Beach Boys|magazine=Music Favorites|volume=1|issue=2|date=1976}}</ref>

After months of recording and media hype, ''Smile'' was shelved for personal, technical, and legal reasons.{{sfn|Matijas-Mecca|2017|pp=xiv, 60–63, 77–78}} A February 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|255000|1967|end_year={{Inflation-year|US}}}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit was an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=170, 178, 243}} Many of Wilson's associates, including Parks and Anderle, disassociated themselves from the group by April 1967.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=120}} Brian later said: "Time can be spent in the studio to the point where you get so next to it, you don't know where you are with it—you decide to just chuck it for a while."<ref name="An American Band">{{cite AV media | people = Leo, Malcolm (Director) | year=1985 | title =[[The Beach Boys: An American Band]]| medium =Documentary}}</ref> In the decades following ''Smile''{{'}}s non-release, it became the subject of intense speculation and mystique{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=118}}{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=55}} and the most legendary unreleased album in pop music history.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=63}} Many of the album's advocates believe that had it been released, it would have altered the group's direction and cemented them at the vanguard of rock innovators.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=119}} In 2011, ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine staff voted ''Smile'' the "greatest [[bootleg recording]] of all time".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Beach Boys' 'Smile' named as the greatest ever bootleg by Uncut|url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-beach-boys/59950|magazine=[[NME]]|access-date=December 12, 2014|date=October 21, 2011|archive-date=May 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506060911/http://www.nme.com/news/the-beach-boys/59950|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 1967–1969: Faltering popularity and Brian's reduced involvement ===

====''Smiley Smile''====

From 1965 to 1967, the Beach Boys had developed a musical and lyrical sophistication that contrasted their work from before and after. This divide was further solidified by the difference in sound between their albums and their stage performances.{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p= {{page needed|date=May 2018}}}} This resulted in a split fanbase corresponding to two distinct musical markets. One group enjoys the band's early work as a wholesome representation of American popular culture from before the political and social movements brought on in the mid-1960s. The other group also appreciates the early songs for their energy and complexity, but not as much as the band's ambitious work that was created during the formative [[psychedelic era]].{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p={{page needed|date=May 2018}}}} At the time, rock music journalists typically valued the Beach Boys' early records over their experimental work.{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p=218}}{{refn|group=nb|For example, critics from ''Rolling Stone'' were wary of the group's changing music, with [[Ralph J. Gleason]] writing in January 1968: "The Beach Boys, when they were a reflection of an actuality of American society (i.e., Southern California hot rod, surfing and beer-bust fraternity culture), made music that had vitality and interest. When they went past that, they were forced inexorably to go into electronics and this excursion, for them, is of limited scope, good as the vibrations were."{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p=218}}}}

Although ''Smile'' had been cancelled, the Beach Boys were still under pressure and a contractual obligation to record and present an album to Capitol.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=124}} Carl remembered: "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a homespun version of [''Smile''] instead. We're just going to take it easy. I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was ''[[Smiley Smile]]''."<ref name=Himes1983>{{cite magazine|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|author-link=Geoffrey Himes|title=The Beach Boys High Times and Ebb Tides Carl Wilson Recalls 20 Years With and Without Brian|magazine=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]|date=September 1983|issue=59|url=http://troun.tripod.com/carl.html|access-date=May 13, 2018|archive-date=May 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525211740/http://troun.tripod.com/carl.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Sessions for the new album lasted from June to July 1967 at [[Beach Boys Studio|Brian's new makeshift home studio]].

In July 1967, lead single "[[Heroes and Villains]]" was issued, arriving after months of public anticipation, and reached number 12 in US. By then, the group's lawsuit with Capitol was resolved, and it was agreed that ''Smile'' would not be the band's next album.{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=134}} In August, the group embarked on a two-date tour of Hawaii.{{sfn|Matijas-Mecca|2017|pp=80, 82}} The shows saw Brian make a brief return to live performance, as Bruce Johnston chose to take a temporary break from the band during the summer of 1967, feeling that the atmosphere within the band "had all got too weird".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bellagio10452.com/unreleased.html|title=UNRELEASED|website=Bellagio10452.com}}</ref>{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=128}} ''Smiley Smile'' was released on September 18, 1967,{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=200}} and peaked at number 41 in the US,{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=119}} making it their worst-selling album to that date.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=124}} Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album.{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p=216}} According to Scott Schinder, the album was released to "general incomprehension. While ''Smile'' may have divided the Beach Boys' fans had it been released, ''Smiley Smile'' merely baffled them."{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=119}} The group was virtually blacklisted by the music press, to the extent that reviews of the group's records were either withheld from publication or published long after the release dates.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=200}} When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=200, 203}} Over the years, the album gathered a reputation as one of the best "[[chill-out music|chill-out]]" albums to listen to during an LSD [[comedown (drugs)|comedown]].{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=44}} In 1974, ''NME'' voted it the 64th-greatest album of all time.{{sfn|Matijas-Mecca|2017|p=80}}

The Beach Boys immediately recorded a new album, ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'', an excursion into [[soul music]], and a self-conscious attempt to "regroup" themselves as a rock band in opposition to their more orchestral affairs of the past.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=49–50}} Its music differs in many ways from previous Beach Boys records: it contains very little group singing compared to previous albums, and mainly features Brian singing at his piano.

''Wild Honey'' was released on December 18, 1967, in competition with the Beatles' ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'' and the Rolling Stones' ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]''.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=208}} It had a higher chart placing than ''Smiley Smile'', but still failed to make the top-twenty and remained on the charts for only 15 weeks.<ref name="SmileySmileliner" /> As with ''Smiley Smile'', contemporary critics viewed it as inconsequential,{{sfn|Leaf|1985|p=125}} and it alienated fans whose expectations had been raised by ''Smile''.<ref name="SmileySmileliner" /> That month, Mike Love told a British journalist: "Brian has been rethinking our recording program and in any case we all have a much greater say nowadays in what we turn out in the studio."<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Beat Instrumental|author=P.G.|title='Personal Promotion is the thing' say Beach Boys|date=February 1968}}</ref>

The Beach Boys were at their lowest popularity in the late 1960s, and their cultural standing was especially worsened by their public image, which remained incongruous with their peers' "heavier" music.<ref name="Christgau1975">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=June 23, 1975|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/chicago-75.php|title=Beach Boys at Summer's End|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=September 14, 2018|archive-date=September 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915001824/https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/chicago-75.php|url-status=live}}</ref> At the end of 1967, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' co-founder and editor [[Jann Wenner]] printed an influential article that denounced the Beach Boys as "just one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles.

After meeting [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] at a [[UNICEF]] Variety Gala in Paris, Love and other high-profile celebrities such as the Beatles and [[Donovan]] traveled to [[Rishikesh]], India, in February–March 1968. The following Beach Boys album, ''[[Friends (The Beach Boys album)|Friends]]'', had songs influenced by the [[Transcendental Meditation]] the Maharishi taught. In support of ''Friends'', Love arranged for the Beach Boys to [[The Beach Boys' 1968 US tour with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|tour with the Maharishi in the US]]. Starting on May 3, 1968, the tour lasted five shows and was canceled when the Maharishi withdrew to fulfill film contracts. Because of disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's withdrawal, 24 tour dates were canceled at a cost estimated at $250,000.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=196}} ''Friends'', released on June 24, peaked at number 126 in the US.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=120}} In August, Capitol issued an album of Beach Boys backing tracks, ''[[Stack-o-Tracks]]''. It was the first Beach Boys LP that failed to chart in the US and UK.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=120–121}}

In June 1968, Dennis befriended [[Charles Manson]], an aspiring singer-songwriter, and their relationship lasted for several months. Dennis bought him time at Brian's home studio, where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|pp=168–70, 340}}{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=202, 208}} Dennis then proposed that Manson be signed to Brother Records. Brian reportedly disliked Manson, and a deal was never made.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=168}} In July 1968, the group released the single "[[Do It Again (The Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]", which lyrically harkened back to their earlier surf songs. Around this time, Brian admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital; his bandmates wrote and produced material in his absence.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=140–141}} Released in January 1969, the album ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]'' mixed new material with outtakes and leftovers from recent albums; Brian produced virtually none of the newer recordings.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=213}}

The Beach Boys recorded one song by Manson without his involvement: "Cease to Exist", rewritten as "[[Never Learn Not to Love]]", which was included on ''20/20''. As [[Manson Family|his cult of followers]] took over Dennis's home, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=224}} According to author [[David Leaf]], "The entire Wilson family reportedly feared for their lives."{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=137}}

In August, the Manson Family committed the [[Tate–LaBianca murders]]. According to Jon Parks, the band's tour manager, it was widely suspected in the Hollywood community that Manson was responsible for the murders, and it had been known that Manson had been involved with the Beach Boys, causing the band to be viewed as pariahs for a time.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Tom|title=Chaos: Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG92DwAAQBAJ|year=2019|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-47757-4|access-date=December 2, 2020|archive-date=June 6, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210606182949/https://books.google.com/books?id=zG92DwAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> In November, police apprehended Manson, and his connection with the Beach Boys received media attention. He was later convicted for several counts of murder and [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to murder.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=219}}

====Selling of the band's publishing====
{{Further|Sea of Tunes}}

In April 1969, the band revisited its 1967 lawsuit against Capitol after it alleged an audit revealed the band was owed over $2 million for unpaid royalties and production duties.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=221}} In May, Brian told the music press that the group's funds were depleted to the point that it was considering filing for bankruptcy at the end of the year, which ''[[Disc & Music Echo]]'' called "stunning news" and a "tremendous shock on the American pop scene". Brian hoped that the success of a forthcoming single, "[[Break Away (The Beach Boys song)|Break Away]]", would mend the financial issues.<!-- <ref name="May69"/> -->{{Citation needed|reason=ref name May69 not defined.|date=December 2018}} The song, written and produced by Brian and Murry, reached number 63 in the US and number 6 in the UK,{{sfn|Badman|2004}} and Brian's remarks to the press ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with [[Deutsche Grammophon]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=149}} The group's Capitol contract expired two weeks later with one more album still due. ''[[Live in London (The Beach Boys album)|Live in London]]'', a live album recorded in December 1968, was released in the UK and a few other countries in 1970 to fulfil the contract, although it would not see US release until 1976, under the erroneous re-title ''Beach Boys '69''.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=238}} After the contract was completed Capitol deleted the Beach Boys' catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=221}} The lawsuit was later settled in their favor and they acquired the rights to their post-1965 catalog.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=}}

In August, [[Sea of Tunes]], the Beach Boys' catalog, was sold to Irving Almo Music for $700,000 (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|700000|1969|end_year={{Inflation-year|US}}}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}).{{sfn|Love|2016|p=226}} According to his wife, [[Marilyn Wilson]], Brian was devastated by the sale.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=224–225}} Over the years, the catalog generated more than $100 million in publishing royalties, none of which Murry or the band members ever received.{{sfn|Love|2016|p=227}} That same month, Carl, Dennis, Love, and Jardine sought a permanent replacement for Johnston, with Johnston unaware of this search. They approached Carl's brother-in-law [[Billy Hinsche]], who declined the offer to focus on his college studies.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=253}}

The group was signed to [[Reprise Records]] in 1970.<ref name="allmusic" /> Scott Schinder described the label as "probably the hippest and most artist-friendly major label of the time".{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=121–122}} The deal was brokered by Van Dyke Parks, who was then employed as a multimedia executive at [[Warner Music Group]]. Reprise's contract stipulated Brian's proactive involvement with the band in all albums.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=150}} By the time the Beach Boys' tenure ended with Capitol in 1969, they had sold 65 million records worldwide, closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music.<ref>{{cite magazine| date=November 14, 1970 |title=The Best Kept Secret in the World: "The Most Dynamic Vocal Group Rock Has Produced" |magazine=Billboard Magazine |volume= 82 |issue= 46 |page=4 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ|page=4}} |access-date=April 27, 2013}}</ref> After recording over 30 different songs and going through several album titles, their first LP for Reprise, ''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'', was released on August 31, 1970.<ref name="White2000">{{cite AV media notes|title=Sunflower/Surf's Up|others=The Beach Boys|year=2000|first=Timothy|last=White|author-link=Timothy White (editor)|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=CD Liner|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Sunflower_Surf_s_Up.html|access-date=May 13, 2018|archive-date=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006135103/http://albumlinernotes.com/Sunflower_Surf_s_Up.html|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Sunflower'' featured a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all six band members.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=73}} Brian was active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of ''Sunflower'''s 12 songs and performing at half of the band's domestic concerts in 1970.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=153–154}} The album received critical acclaim in both the US and the UK.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=153}}

In mid-1970, the Beach Boys hired radio presenter [[Jack Rieley]] as their manager. One of his initiatives was to encourage the band to record songs featuring more socially conscious lyrics.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=155}} He also requested the completion of ''Smile'' track "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]" and arranged a guest appearance at a [[Grateful Dead]] concert at [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s [[Fillmore East]] in April 1971 to foreground the Beach Boys' transition into the counterculture.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=241–242}} During this time, the group ceased wearing matching uniforms on stage,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=155–156}} while Dennis took time to star alongside [[James Taylor]], [[Laurie Bird]], and [[Warren Oates]] in the cult film ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]'', released in 1971.

On August 30, the band released ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'', which was moderately successful, reaching the US top-thirty, a marked improvement over their recent releases.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=242}} While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at [[Carnegie Hall]]; their live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of their previous songs,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=155–158}} with their [[set list]]s culling from ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile''.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=140}} On October 28, the Beach Boys were the featured cover story on that date's issue of ''Rolling Stone''. It included the first part of a lengthy two-part interview, titled "The Beach Boys: A California Saga", conducted by [[Tom Nolan (actor)|Tom Nolan]] and David Felton.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=300}} 

Early 1972 saw Bruce Johnston leave the band, and the recruitment of two former members of South African band [[the Flames]], guitarist/singer [[Blondie Chaplin]] and drummer/singer [[Ricky Fataar]]. The new line-up released ''[[Carl and the Passions – "So Tough"]]'' in May 1972. The original US release was a double album, the second disc being a reissue of ''Pet Sounds''.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=311}} After the upswing of ''Surf's Up'', ''Carl and the Passions'' was relatively unsuccessful in the US, charting at number 50. It was more successful in the UK, where it was issued as a single album without ''Pet Sounds'', peaking at number 25. The next album, ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]'', was released in January 1973. Reprise initially rejected the album, feeling it lacked a strong single. Following the intervention of Van Dyke Parks, this resulted in the inclusion of "[[Sail On, Sailor]]".{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=184, 305}} Reprise approved, and the resulting album peaked at number 37. Brian's musical children's story, ''[[Mount Vernon and Fairway]]'', was included with the album as a bonus [[extended play|EP]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=181–182}}

====Greatest hits LPs, touring resurgence, and Caribou sessions====

After ''Holland'', the group maintained a touring regimen, captured on the double live album ''[[The Beach Boys in Concert]]'' released in November 1973, but recorded very little in the studio through 1975.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=323}} Several months earlier, they had announced that they would complete ''Smile'', but this never came to fruition, and plans for its release were once again abandoned.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=305}}{{refn|group=nb|Pursuant to the terms of their record contract, when the group missed their May 1973 deadline to deliver the ''Smile'' album, Warner Bros. deducted $50,000 from the band's next advance.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=305, 327}}}} Following Murry's death in June 1973, Brian retreated into his bedroom and withdrew further into drug abuse, alcoholism, [[chain smoking]], and overeating.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=329–330}} In October, the band dismissed Rieley as manager and appointed Mike Love's brother, Stephen, and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] manager [[James William Guercio]].{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=331, 336}} Chaplin and Fataar left the band in December 1973 and November 1974, respectively, reducing the band back to the original five members.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=332, 341}}

The Beach Boys' greatest hits compilation album ''[[Endless Summer (The Beach Boys album)|Endless Summer]]'' was released in June 1974 to unexpected success, becoming the band's second number 1 US album in October.{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=217}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=339}} The LP had a 155-week chart run, selling over 3 million copies.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=193}} A second volume of greatest hits, ''[[Spirit of America (album)|Spirit of America]]'', followed in April 1975, reaching US number 8, being certified Gold, and having a 43-week chart run. The Beach Boys became the number-one act in the US,{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=339}} propelling themselves from opening for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] in the summer of 1974 to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=193–194}} Guercio prevailed upon the group to swap out newer songs with older material in their concert setlists,{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=216}} partly to accommodate their growing audience and the demand for their early hits.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=192}} Later in the year, members of the band appeared as guests on Chicago's hit "[[Wishing You Were Here]]".{{sfn|White|1996|p=287}} At the end of 1974, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' proclaimed the Beach Boys "Band of the Year" based on the strength of their live performances.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=193–194}}{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=218}}

To capitalize on their sudden resurgence in popularity, the Beach Boys accepted Guercio's invitation to record their next Reprise album at his [[Caribou Ranch]] studio, located around the mountains of [[Nederland, Colorado]].{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=341}}{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=217}}{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=194–195}} These October 1974 sessions marked the group's return to the studio after a 21-month period of virtual inactivity, but the proceedings were cut short after Brian had insisted on returning to his home in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=341}} With the project put on hold, the Beach Boys spent most of the next year on the road playing college football stadiums and basketball arenas.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=195}}{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=218}} The only Beach Boys recording of 1974 to see release at the time was the Christmas single "[[Child of Winter (Christmas Song)|Child of Winter]]", recorded upon the group's return to Los Angeles in November and released the following month.

Over the summer of 1975, the touring group played a co-headlining series of concert dates with Chicago, a pairing that was nicknamed "[[Beachago]]".{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=196}}{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=219}} The tour was massively successful and restored the Beach Boys' profitability to what it had been in the mid-1960s.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=347}} Although another joint tour with Chicago had been planned for the summer of 1976,{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=219}} the Beach Boys' association with Guercio and his Caribou Management company ended in early 1976.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=362}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Gaines, Guercio may have been fired because members of the group "felt Caribou was being overpaid", although "many observers suggest the Beach Boys followed an old pattern of jettisoning personnel when their financial situation improved".{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=269}} Biographer Mark Dillon states that the tour evaporated due to Dennis' budding romance with [[Karen Lamm]], the ex-wife of Chicago keyboardist [[Robert Lamm]].{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=219}} }} Stephen Love subsequently took over as the band's ''de facto'' business manager.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=269}}

====''15 Big Ones'', ''Love You'', and ''Adult/Child''====

Early in 1975, Brian signed a production deal with [[California Music]], a Los Angeles collective that included Bruce Johnston and Gary Usher, but was drawn away by the Beach Boys' pressing demands for a new album.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198, 205}} In October, Marilyn persuaded Brian to admit himself to the care of psychologist [[Eugene Landy]], who kept him from indulging in substance abuse with constant supervision.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=253–255}}{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198–199}} Brian was kept in the program until December 1976.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=215}}

[[File:Brian Wilson 1976.png|thumb|left|Brian Wilson behind [[Brother Studios]]' mixing console in early 1976]]

At the end of January 1976, the Beach Boys returned to the studio with Brian producing once again.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=358}} Brian decided the band should do an album of rock and roll and [[doo wop]] standards. Carl and Dennis disagreed, feeling that an album of originals was far more ideal, while Love and Jardine wanted the album out as quickly as possible.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=358}} To highlight Brian's recovery and his return to writing and producing, Stephen launched a media campaign and paid the [[Rogers & Cowan]] publicity agency $3,500 per month to implement it.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=287}} The band also commissioned an [[NBC]]-TV special, later known as ''[[The Beach Boys: It's OK!]]'', that was produced by ''[[Saturday Night Live|NBC's Saturday Night]]'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=215}}

Released on July 5, 1976, ''[[15 Big Ones]]'' was generally disliked by fans and critics, as well as Carl and Dennis, who disparaged the album to the press.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=364}} The album peaked at number 8 in the US, becoming their first top-ten album of new material since ''Pet Sounds'', and their highest-charting studio album since ''Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)''.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=96, 364}} Lead single "[[Rock and Roll Music (song)|Rock and Roll Music]]" peaked at number 5 – their highest chart ranking since "Good Vibrations".{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=362}}

From late-1976 to early-1977, Brian made sporadic public appearances and produced the band's next album, ''[[The Beach Boys Love You]]''.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=290}} He regarded it as a spiritual successor to ''Pet Sounds'', namely because of the autobiographical lyrics.{{sfn|Wilson|Greenman|2016|p=197}} Released on April 11, 1977, ''Love You'' peaked at number 53 in the US and number 28 in the UK.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=371}} Critically, it was widely praised, though it initially met with polarized reactions from the public.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=124}} Numerous esteemed critics penned favorable reviews, but casual listeners generally found the album's idiosyncratic sound to be a detriment.{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=233}}

''[[Adult/Child]]'', the intended follow-up to ''Love You'', was completed, but the release was vetoed by Love and Jardine.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=222–223}} According to Stan Love, when his brother Mike heard the album, Mike turned to Brian and asked: "What the fuck are you doing?"{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=223}} Some of the unreleased songs on ''Adult/Child'' later saw individual release on subsequent Beach Boys albums and compilations.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=256–371}} Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=226}}

At the beginning of 1977, the Beach Boys had enjoyed their most lucrative concert tours ever, with the band playing in packed stadiums and earning up to $150,000 per show.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=217–218}} Concurrently, the band was the subject of a record company bidding war, as their contract with Warner Bros. had been set to expire soon.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=294}}{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=216–217}} Stephen Love arranged for the Beach Boys to sign an $8 million deal with [[Sony Music|CBS Records]] on March 1.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=294–295}} Numerous stipulations were given in the CBS contract, including that Brian was required to write at least four songs per album, co-write at least 70% of all the tracks, and produce or co-produce alongside his brothers.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=295}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Gaines, "When Brian signed the contract, he cried, knowing he would now have to go back to the studio full-time."{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=295}}}} Another part of the deal required the group to play thirty concerts a year in the U.S., in addition to one tour in Australia and Japan, and two tours in Europe.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=295}} The first Beach Boys-related release on CBS was Dennis' solo album ''[[Pacific Ocean Blue]]'', which would be issued in August 1977.

Within weeks of the CBS contract, the band dismissed Stephen, with one of the alleged reasons being that Mike had not permitted Stephen to sign on his behalf while at a TM retreat in Switzerland.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=295–296, 298}} For Stephen's replacement, the group hired Carl's friend Henry Lazarus, an entertainment business owner that had no prior experience in the music industry.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=299}} Lazarus arranged a major European tour for the Beach Boys, starting in late July, with stops in Germany, Switzerland, and France.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=299}} Due to poor planning, the tour was cancelled shortly before it began. The band dismissed Lazarus and were sued by many of the concert promoters, with losses of $200,000 in preliminary expenses and $550,000 in potential revenue.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=300}}

In July, the Beach Boys played a concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] before Mike attacked Brian with a piano bench onstage in front of over 15,000 attendees.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=301}}{{refn|group=nb|Love later explained that he had been "in a state of extreme sensitivity" after learning that his girlfriend was in a vegetative state following "a horrific car accident".{{sfn|Love|2016|p=427}}}} In August, Mike and Jardine persuaded Stephen to return as the group's manager,{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=302}} a decision that Carl and Dennis had strongly opposed.{{sfn|White|1996|p=321}}{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=302}} By this point, the band had effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl on one side, and Mike and Jardine on the other, with Brian remaining neutral.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=218–219}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=371}} The internal wrangling came to a head in September, with Dennis declaring to a ''Rolling Stone'' journalist that he had left the band.<ref name=Swenson1977>{{cite magazine|last1=Swenson|first1=John|title=The Beach Boys – No More Fun Fun Fun|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 20, 1977|url=http://smileysmile.net/board/index.php?topic=6867.0|access-date=February 1, 2015|archive-date=June 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624043744/http://smileysmile.net/board/index.php?topic=6867.0|url-status=live}}</ref> The group was broken up until a meeting at Brian's house on September 17.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=371}} In light of the lucrative CBS contract, the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian's vote in the group, allowing Love and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis on any matter.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=371}}

The group had still owed one more album for Reprise. Released in September 1978, ''[[M.I.U. Album]]'' was recorded at [[Maharishi International University]] in Iowa at the suggestion of Love.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=224}} The band originally attempted to record a Christmas album, to be titled ''[[Merry Christmas from the Beach Boys]]'', but this idea was rejected by Reprise. These Christmas recordings would eventually be released in 1998 as part of the archival album ''[[Ultimate Christmas]]''. Dennis and Carl made limited contributions to ''M.I.U. Album''; the album was produced by Jardine and [[Ron Altbach]], with Brian credited as "executive producer".{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=225}} Dennis started to withdraw from the group to focus on his second solo album, ''[[Bambu (album)|Bambu]]'', which was shelved just as alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=124}}

====''L.A. (Light Album)'' and ''Keepin' the Summer Alive''====

[[File:The Beach Boys 1979.jpg|thumb|right|The Beach Boys in 1979]]
The group's first two albums for CBS, 1979's ''[[L.A. (Light Album)]]'' and 1980's ''[[Keepin' the Summer Alive]]'', struggled in the US, charting at 100 and 75 respectively, though the band did manage a top-forty single from ''L.A. (Light Album)'' with "[[Good Timin' (The Beach Boys song)|Good Timin']]". The recording of these albums saw Bruce Johnston return to the band, initially solely as a producer and eventually as a full-time band member. In-between the two albums, the group contributed the song "[[It's a Beautiful Day (The Beach Boys song)|It's a Beautiful Day]]" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Americathon]]''.

On June 21, 1980, the Beach Boys performed a concert at [[Knebworth]], England, which featured a slightly intoxicated Dennis. The concert would later be released as a live album titled ''[[Good Timin': Live at Knebworth England 1980]]'' in 2002. In 1981, the band scored a surprise US top-twenty hit when their cover of [[the Del-Vikings]]' "[[Come Go with Me]]", from the three year old ''M.I.U. Album'', was released as a single from ''[[Ten Years of Harmony]]'', a double compilation album focusing on the Reprise and CBS years.<ref>Whitburn, Joel (2004).

In an April 1980 interview, Carl reflected that "the last two years have been the most important and difficult time of our career. We were at the ultimate crossroads. We had to decide whether what we had been involved in since we were teenagers had lost its meaning. We asked ourselves and each other the difficult questions we'd often avoided in the past."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lloyd|first1=Jack|title=Surf Wasn't Always Smooth|publisher=Knight News Service|date=April 25, 1980}}</ref> In 1981, he temporarily left the touring group because of unhappiness with the band's nostalgia format and lackluster live performances, taking the time to record and release his first solo album ''[[Carl Wilson (album)|Carl Wilson]]''.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=124}} He stated: "I haven't quit the Beach Boys but I do not plan on touring with them until they decide that 1981 means as much to them as 1961."<ref name="Jarnow15">{{cite web|last1=Jarnow|first1=Jesse|title=Carl Only Knows: A New Biography of the Man Legally Known as the Beach Boys|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/926-carl-only-knows-a-new-biography-of-the-man-legally-known-as-the-beach-boys/|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=October 12, 2015|access-date=April 21, 2020|archive-date=June 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200616042103/https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/926-carl-only-knows-a-new-biography-of-the-man-legally-known-as-the-beach-boys/|url-status=live}}</ref> He returned in May 1982, after approximately 14 months of being away, on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies and refrain from "Las Vegas-type" engagements.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=373}}

====Death of Dennis, ''The Beach Boys'', and ''Still Cruisin''{{'}}====

[[Image:Reagans with the Beach Boys.jpg|thumb|The Beach Boys with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] at the [[White House]], June 1983]]
By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dennis had been embroiled in successive failed romantic relationships, including a tense and short-lived relationship with [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s [[Christine McVie]], and found himself in severe economic trouble resulting in the sale of [[Brother Studios]], established by the Wilson brothers in 1974 and where ''Pacific Ocean Blue'' was produced, and the forfeiture of his beloved yacht. To cope with the combination of devastating losses, Dennis heavily abused alcohol, cocaine, and heroin and was, by 1983, homeless and lived a nomadic lifestyle. He was often seen spending much of his time wandering the Los Angeles coast and often missed Beach Boys performances. By this point, he had lost his voice and much of his ability to play drums.<ref>{{cite AV media |last1=O'Casey |first1=Matt |title=Dennis Wilson: The Real Beach Boy |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1704872/ |via=IMDb |date=February 26, 2010}}</ref>

That year, tensions between Dennis and Love escalated to the point that each filed a restraining order against the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brain-sharper.com/entertainment/beach-boys-ob/|title=Brian Wilson Explains Why The Beach Boys Will Never Get Back Together|publisher=BrainSharper|date=July 19, 2019|last=Foster|first=JJ|access-date=January 5, 2021|archive-date=March 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326061654/http://www.brain-sharper.com/entertainment/beach-boys-ob/|url-status=live}}</ref> Following Brian's readmission for Landy's treatment, Dennis was given an ultimatum after his last performance in November to check into rehab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with the band again. Dennis checked into rehab for his chance to get sober, but on December 28, he drowned at the age of 39 in [[Marina del Rey]] while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items that he had previously thrown overboard in a fit of rage.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=247}}

The Beach Boys spent the next several years touring, often playing in front of large audiences, and recording songs for film soundtracks and various artists compilations.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=126}} One new studio album, the self-titled ''[[The Beach Boys (album)|The Beach Boys]]'', appeared in 1985 and proved a modest success, becoming their highest-charting album in the US since ''15 Big Ones''. It was the band's last album for CBS, as they returned to Capitol in 1986 with a 25th anniversary greatest hits album, ''[[Made in U.S.A. (The Beach Boys album)|Made in U.S.A]]'', which went double platinum. In 1988, the Beach Boys unexpectedly claimed their first US number 1 single in 22 years with "[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]", which topped the chart for one week.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-beach-boys/chart-history/hsi/|title=The Beach Boys Kokomo (From"Cocktail" ) Chart History|magazine=Billboard|access-date=May 14, 2018|archive-date=November 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211117203022/https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-beach-boys/chart-history/hsi/|url-status=live}}</ref> The track was included on the band's next studio album, 1989's ''[[Still Cruisin']]'', which went platinum in the US.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53|title=September RIAA certifications|date=October 25, 2003|magazine=Billboard|language=en|page=53|access-date=May 14, 2018|archive-date=June 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200618111308/https://books.google.com/books?id=IBEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53|url-status=live}}</ref>

Biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] summarized: "Once surfin' pin-ups, they remade themselves as [[avant-garde pop]] artists, then psychedelic oracles. After that they were down-home hippies, then retro-hip icons. Eventually they devolved into none of the above: a kind of perpetual-motion nostalgia machine."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Carlin|first1=Peter Ames|author-link=Peter Ames Carlin|title=MUSIC; A Rock Utopian Still Chasing An American Dream|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/arts/music-a-rock-utopian-still-chasing-an-american-dream.html|date=March 25, 2001|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=May 13, 2018|archive-date=June 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612204232/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/arts/music-a-rock-utopian-still-chasing-an-american-dream.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Music journalist Erik Davis wrote in 1990: "the Beach Boys are either dead, deranged, or dinosaurs; their records are Eurocentric, square, unsampled; they've made too much money to merit hip revisionism".<ref name="Davis1990"/> In 1992, critic Jim Miller wrote: "They have become a figment of their own past, prisoners of their unflagging popularity—incongruous emblems of a sunny myth of eternal youth belied by much of their own best music.&nbsp;... The group is still largely identified with its hits from the early Sixties."{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=192, 195}}

Love filed a defamation lawsuit against Brian due to how he was presented in Brian's 1992 memoir ''[[Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story]]''. Its publisher [[HarperCollins]] settled the suit for $1.5 million. He said that the suit allowed his lawyer "to gain access to the transcripts of Brian's interviews with his [book] collaborator, Todd Gold. Those interviews affirmed—according to Brian—that I had been the inspiration of the group and that I had written many of the songs that [would soon be] in dispute."{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=353–354}} Other defamation lawsuits were filed by Carl, Brother Records, and the Wilsons' mother Audree.{{sfn|Love|2016|p=353}} With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed in royalties and songwriting credits, [[Love v.

In 1997, Carl was diagnosed with [[Lung cancer|lung]] and [[brain cancer]] after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl performed with the band on its summer tour (a double-bill with [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]) while undergoing chemo. During performances, he sat on a stool and needed oxygen after each song.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=286–287}} When Carl became too unwell to perform in late 1997, David Marks returned as lead guitarist.

In February 2020, Wilson and Jardine's official social media pages encouraged fans to boycott the band's music after it was announced that Love's Beach Boys would perform at the Safari Club International Convention in [[Reno, Nevada]] on animal rights grounds.

==Musical style and development==
{{See also|Brian Wilson#Artistry}}
In ''Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis'', musicologist Daniel Harrison writes:
{{blockquote|Even from their inception, the Beach Boys were an [[experimental music|experimental]] group. They combined, as Jim Miller has put it, "the instrumental sleekness of [[the Ventures]], the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry, and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between [[the Lettermen]] and [[Frankie Lymon]] and [[the Teenagers]]" with lyrics whose images, idioms, and concerns were drawn from the rarefied world of the middle-class white male southern California teenager.&nbsp;... [But] it was the profound vocal virtuosity of the group, coupled with the obsessional drive and compositional ambitions of their leader, Brian Wilson, that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever.&nbsp;... Comparison to other vocally oriented rock groups, such as [[the Association]], shows the Beach Boys' technique to be far superior, almost embarrassingly so. They were so confident of their ability, and of Brian's skill as a producer to enhance it, that they were unafraid of doing sophisticated, [[a cappella]] glee-club arrangements containing multiple [[suspension (music)|suspensions]], passing [[musical form|formations]], complex chords, and both [[chromatic]] and [[enharmonic]] [[modulation (music)|modulations]].{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}}}}

The Beach Boys began as a [[garage band]] playing 1950s style [[rock and roll]],{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=15}} reassembling styles of music such as surf to include [[vocal jazz]] [[jazz harmony|harmony]], which created their unique sound.{{sfn|Zager|2011|p=216}} In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the [[pop ballad]] by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=35}} Among the distinct elements of the Beach Boys' style were the nasal quality of their singing voices, their use of a falsetto harmony over a driving, locomotive-like melody, and the sudden chiming in of the whole group on a key line.<ref name="nasal">{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jonathan|title=The Influence of the Beatles on the Music of Rock & Roll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgoYAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Columbia College, Columbia University|date=1966|journal=King's Crown Essays|access-date=April 25, 2016|archive-date=June 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200619070433/https://books.google.com/books?id=kgoYAAAAMAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> Brian Wilson handled most stages of the group's recording process from the beginning, even though he was not properly credited on earlier recordings.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=26}}

[[File:1967 Rickenbacker 360-12 12 string electric guitar owned and photographed by Greg Field.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A [[Rickenbacker 360/12]] identical to the 12-string guitar used by Carl Wilson in the early to mid-1960s]]
Early on, Mike Love sang lead vocals in the rock-oriented songs, while Carl contributed guitar lines on the group's ballads.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} Jim Miller commented: "On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead&nbsp;... on ballads, Brian played his [[falsetto]] off against lush, [[jazz]]-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures."{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} Harrison adds that "even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone".{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}} Although Brian was often dubbed a perfectionist, he was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding of music was mostly self-taught.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=105, 114}} At the lyric stage, he usually worked with Love,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=73}} whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=108}} Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle, in the examples "[[Lonely Sea]]" and "[[In My Room]]".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=27}}

Brian's bandmates resented the notion that he was the sole creative force in the group.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=110}} In a 1966 article that asked if "the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian", Carl said that although Brian was the most responsible for their music, every member of the group contributed ideas.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=146–147}} Mike Love wrote: "As far as I was concerned, Brian ''was'' a genius, deserving of that recognition. But the rest of us were seen as nameless components in Brian's music machine&nbsp;... It didn't feel to us as if we were just riding on Brian's coattails."{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=145–147}} Conversely, Dennis defended Brian's stature in the band, stating: "Brian Wilson ''is'' the Beach Boys. He is the band. We're his fucking messengers. He is all of it. Period. We're nothing. He's everything."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=316}}

===Influences===
{{Further|List of songs covered by the Beach Boys}}
The band's earliest influences came primarily from the work of Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=16}} Performed by the Four Freshmen, "[[Their Hearts Were Full of Spring]]" (1961) was a particular favorite of the group.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=34, 54}} By analyzing their arrangements of [[pop standards]], Brian educated himself on jazz harmony.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=5}} Bearing this in mind, Philip Lambert noted: "If [[Bob Flanigan (singer)|Bob Flanigan]] helped teach Brian how to sing, then [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]], [[Jerome Kern|Kern]], [[Cole Porter|Porter]], and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song."{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=6}} Other general influences on the group included [[the Hi-Lo's]],{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=16}} [[the Penguins]], [[the Robins]], [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], [[Otis Williams]], [[The Cadets (group)|the Cadets]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[the Shirelles]], [[The Regents (doo-wop band)|the Regents]], and [[the Crystals]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=14–15}}

The eclectic mix of white and black vocal group influences – ranging from the rock and roll of Berry, the jazz harmonies of the Four Freshmen, the pop of [[the Four Preps]], the folk of [[the Kingston Trio]], the R&B of groups like [[the Coasters]] and [[the Five Satins]], and the doo wop of [[Dion and the Belmonts]] – helped contribute to the Beach Boys' uniqueness in American popular music.{{sfn|Murphy|2015|p=58}} Carl remembered that Love was "really immersed in doo-wop" and likely "influenced Brian to listen to it", adding that the "black artists were so much better in terms of rock records in those days that the white records almost sounded like put-ons".<ref name=HimesSurf />

Another significant influence on Brian's work was [[Burt Bacharach]].{{sfn|Matijas-Mecca|2017|p=37}} He said in the 1960s: "Burt Bacharach and [[Hal David]] are more like me. They're also the best pop team – per se – today. As a producer, Bacharach has a very fresh, new approach."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=64}} Regarding surf rock pioneer [[Dick Dale]], Brian said that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2005/08/10/brian-wilson-interview-with-brian-wilson/|title=Interview with Brian Wilson|date=August 10, 2005 |publisher=theaquarian.com|access-date=November 22, 2009|archive-date=October 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002160721/http://www.theaquarian.com/2005/08/10/brian-wilson-interview-with-brian-wilson/|url-status=live}}</ref> Carl credited Chuck Berry, [[the Ventures]], and [[John Walker (musician)|John Walker]] with shaping his guitar style, and that the Beach Boys had learned to play all of the Ventures' songs by ear early in their career.<ref name="Hinsche">{{cite magazine|last1=Hinsche|first1=Billy|author-link1=Billy Hinsche|title=Carl Wilson Interview|magazine=[[Guitar One]]|url=http://www.billyhinsche.com/story4.html|date=November 2001|access-date=May 18, 2015|archive-date=August 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824230014/http://www.billyhinsche.com/story4.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1967, [[Lou Reed]] wrote in ''[[Aspen (magazine)|Aspen]]'' that the Beach Boys created a "hybrid sound" out of rock and roll and the Four Freshmen, explaining that such songs as "Let Him Run Wild", "Don't Worry Baby", "I Get Around", and "Fun, Fun, Fun" were not unlike "Peppermint Stick" by the Elchords.{{sfn|Unterberger|2009|p=122}} Similarly, [[John Sebastian]] of [[the Lovin' Spoonful]] noted: "Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like [[the Crew Cuts]]. Look what gold he mined out of that."{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=16}}

===Vocals===
Brian identified each member individually for their [[vocal range]], once detailing the ranges for Carl, Dennis, Jardine ("[they] progress upwards through G, A, and B"), Love ("can go from bass to the E above middle C"), and himself ("I can take the second D in the [[treble clef]]").<ref name="PopGenius"/>{{refn|group=nb|Starting with the 1970 sessions for the ''Surf's Up'' album, Stephen Desper remembers the emerging corrosive effects of Brian's incessant [[chain smoking]] and [[cocaine]] use: "He could still do falsettos and stuff, but he'd need Carl to help him. Either that or I'd modify the tape speed-wise to make it artificially higher, so it sounded like the old days."{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=160}}}} He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing to his fascination with a voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a "groovy sectional sound".<ref name="PopGenius">{{cite magazine|title=Brian Pop Genius!|magazine=Melody Maker|date=May 21, 1966|url=http://i1218.photobucket.com/albums/dd420/kwan_dk/MMMay211966.jpg|access-date=August 17, 2014|archive-date=December 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212161705/http://i1218.photobucket.com/albums/dd420/kwan_dk/MMMay211966.jpg|url-status=live}}</ref> He added: "The harmonies that we are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got.

Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake."{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=17}}<ref name="PopGenius"/> For a period, Brian avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying: "I thought people thought I was a [[fairy (gay slang)|fairy]]&nbsp;... the band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'"<ref name=RCMSharp>{{cite magazine|last1=Sharp|first1=Ken|title=Christmas with Brian Wilson|magazine=[[Record Collector]]|date=January 2006|pages=72–76|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>

In the group's early recordings, from lowest [[interval (music)|intervals]] to highest, the group's vocal harmony stack usually began with Love or Dennis, followed by Jardine or Carl, and finally Brian on top, according to Jardine,<ref name=Sharp2013>{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Ken|title=Al Jardine of the Beach Boys: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About "SMiLE" (Interview)|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/al-jardine-smile-beach-boys-interview/|website=Rock Cellar Magazine|access-date=July 2, 2014|date=April 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714111352/http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/al-jardine-smile-beach-boys-interview/|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> while Carl said that the blend was Love on bottom, Carl above, followed by Dennis or Jardine, and then Brian on top.<ref name="HimesSurf">{{cite web|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|author-link=Geoffrey Himes|title=Surf Music|url=http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|website=teachrock.org|publisher=Rock and Roll: An American History|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125223127/http://teachrock.org/media/essays/surf_himes_with_maia_edits_2.pdf|archive-date=November 25, 2015}}</ref> Jardine explains: "We always sang the same vocal intervals.&nbsp;...

===Use of studio musicians===
[[File:The Beach Boys TV.jpg|thumb|The Beach Boys performing in 1964]]
Biographer James Murphy said: "By most contemporary accounts, they were not a very good live band when they started.&nbsp;... The Beach Boys learned to play as a band in front of live audiences", eventually to become "one of the best and enduring live bands".<ref name=RCMMurphy>{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Ken|date=November 6, 2011|title=Catch A Wave: A Chat with Beach Boys Author James B.

As Wilson's arrangements increased in complexity, he began employing a group of professional studio musicians, later known as "[[the Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]]", to assist with recording the instrumentation on select tracks.{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=127}} According to some reports, these musicians then completely replaced the Beach Boys on the backing tracks to their records.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}}<ref name="wong">{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Grant |date=January 3, 2022 |title=Brian Wilson Isn't the Type of Genius You Think He Is |url=https://slate.com/culture/2022/01/the-beach-boys-brian-wilson-documentary-genius-pet-sounds.html |website=Slate}}</ref> Much of the relevant documentation, while accounting for the attendance of unionized session players, had failed to record the presence of the Beach Boys themselves.<ref name="wong"/><ref name="SlowinskiMyth"/> These documents, along with the full unedited studio session tapes, were not available for public scrutiny until the 1990s.<ref name="SlowinskiMyth"/>

Wilson started occasionally employing members of the Wrecking Crew for certain Beach Boys tracks during the 1963 ''Surfer Girl'' sessions – specifically, on two songs, "Hawaii" and "Our Car Club".{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=24}}{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}} The 1964 albums ''Shut Down Volume 2'' and ''All Summer Long'' featured the Beach Boys themselves playing the vast majority of the instruments while occasionally being augmented by outside musicians.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}} It is commonly misreported that Dennis in particular was replaced by [[Hal Blaine]] on drums.<ref name="SlowinskiMyth"/><ref name=P4K2008>{{cite web|last1=Orme|first1=Mike|title=Pacific Ocean Blue: Legacy Edition|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11943-pacific-ocean-blue-legacy-edition/|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=July 8, 2008|access-date=April 21, 2020|archive-date=October 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029161757/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11943-pacific-ocean-blue-legacy-edition/|url-status=live}}</ref> Dennis's drumming is documented on a number of the group's singles, including 1964's "I Get Around", "Fun, Fun, Fun", and "Don't Worry Baby".<ref name="Slowinski2014b">{{cite AV media notes| title = Keep an Eye on Summer 1964 | others= The Beach Boys| year = 2014|first1=Alan|last1=Boyd|first2=Mark|last2=Linette|first3=Craig|last3=Slowinski|author-link1=Alan Boyd|author-link2=Mark Linett|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=Digital Liner|url=http://www.thebeachboys.com/#?news=4111}} ([http://fridaynightboys300.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/the-beach-boys-1964-keep-eye-on-summer.html Mirror])</ref> Starting with the 1965 albums ''Today!'' and ''Summer Days'', Brian used the Wrecking Crew with greater frequency, "but still", Stebbins writes, "the Beach Boys continued to play the instruments on many of the key tracks and single releases".{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}}

Overall, the Beach Boys played the instruments on the majority of their recordings from the decade,<ref name="SlowinskiMyth"/> with 1966 and 1967 being the only years when Wilson used the Wrecking Crew almost exclusively.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}}<ref name="SlowinskiMyth"/> ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile'' are their only albums in which the backing tracks were largely played by studio musicians.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011|pp=}}{{sfn|Dillon|2012|p=25}} After 1967, the band's use of studio musicians was considerably reduced.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}} Wrecking Crew biographer [[Kent Hartman]] supported in [[The Wrecking Crew: The Inside Story of Rock and Roll's Best-Kept Secret|his 2012 book about the musicians]]: "Though [Brian Wilson] had for several months brought in various session players on a sporadic, potluck basis to supplement things, the other Beach Boys generally played on the earliest songs, too."{{sfn|Hartman|2012|p=59}}

The source of the longstanding controversy regarding the Beach Boys' use of studio musicians largely derives from a misinterpreted statement in Leaf's 1978 biography ''[[The Beach Boys and the California Myth]]'', later bolstered by erroneous recollections from participants of the recording sessions.<ref name="SlowinskiMyth"/>{{refn|group=nb|The statement in question was: "from 1963 through 1966 Brian used studio musicians on the instrumental tracks".{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=73}}<ref name="SlowinskiMyth"/>}} Starting in the 1990s, unedited studio session tapes, along with [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) sheets and tape logs, were leaked to the public. Music historian Craig Slowinski, who contributes musician credits to the liner notes of the band's reissues and compilations, wrote in 2006: "[O]nce the vaults were opened up and the tapes were studied, the true situation became clear: the Boys themselves played ''most'' of the instruments on their records until the ''Beach Boys Today!'' album in early 1965."<ref name="SlowinskiMyth">{{cite web |last1=Slowinski |first1=Craig |title=Introduction |url=http://www.beachboysarchives.com/page2 |website=beachboysarchives.com |publisher=Endless Summer Quarterly |access-date=May 14, 2022 |date=2006}}</ref> Slowinski goes on to note: "when painting a picture of a Beach Boys recording session, it's important to examine ''both'' the AFM contracts and the session tapes, either of which may be incomplete on their own".<ref name="SlowinskiMyth"/>

During the period when Brian relied heavily on studio musicians, Carl was an exception among the Beach Boys in that he played alongside the studio musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=114}} In Slowinski's view, "One should not sell short Carl's own contributions; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the horde of high-dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio.

===Spirituality===
The band members often reflected on the spiritual nature of their music (and music in general), particularly for the recording of ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile''.{{sfn|Sellars|2015|pp=8–9}} Even though the Wilsons did not grow up in a particularly religious household,{{sfn|Sellars|2015|p=8}} Carl was described as "the most truly religious person I know" by Brian, and Carl was forthcoming about the group's spiritual beliefs stating: "We believe in God as a kind of [[universal consciousness]]. God is love. God is you. God is me. God is everything right here in this room. It's a spiritual concept which inspires a great deal of our music."{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=85}} Carl told ''Rave'' magazine in 1967 that the group's influences are of a "religious nature", but not any religion in specific, only "an idea based upon that of Universal Consciousness.&nbsp;... The spiritual concept of happiness and doing good to others is extremely important to the lyric of our songs, and the religious element of some of the better [[church music]] is also contained within some of our new work."<ref name=Rave1967>{{cite news|last1=Grant|first1=Mike|title='Our influences are of a religious nature': the Beach Boys on Smile|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/11/beach-boys-smile-brian-wilson|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 11, 2011|access-date=December 13, 2016|archive-date=May 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507035916/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/11/beach-boys-smile-brian-wilson|url-status=live}}</ref>

Brian is quoted during the ''Smile'' era: "I'm very religious. Not in the sense of churches, going to church; but like the essence of ''all'' religion."{{sfn|Sellars|2015|p=8}} During the recording of ''Pet Sounds'', Brian held [[prayer meeting]]s, later reflecting that "God was with us the whole time we were doing this record&nbsp;... I could feel that feeling in my brain."{{sfn|Fusilli|2005|p=97}} In 1966, he explained that he wanted to move into a [[religious music|white spiritual sound]], and predicted that the rest of the music industry would follow suit.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=94}} In 2011, Brian maintained the spirituality was important to his music, and that he did not follow any particular religion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yakas|first1=Ben|title=Our Ten Minutes With Beach Boys Legend Brian Wilson|url=http://gothamist.com/2011/10/27/brian_wilson.php|date=October 27, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725054715/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/27/brian_wilson.php|archive-date=July 25, 2015}}</ref>

Carl said that ''Smile'' was chosen as an album title because of its connection to the group's spiritual beliefs.<ref name=Rave1967/> Brian referred to ''Smile'' as his "teenage symphony to God",{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=4}} composing a [[hymn]], "[[Our Prayer]]", as the album's opening spiritual invocation.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=41, 270}} Experimentation with [[psychotropic]] substances also proved pivotal to the group's development as artists.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Griffiths|first1=David|title=Dennis Wilson: "I Live With 17 Girls"|magazine=Record Mirror|date=December 21, 1968}}</ref>{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=58}} He spoke of his LSD trips as a "religious experience", and during a session for "Our Prayer", Brian can be heard asking the other Beach Boys: "Do you guys feel any acid yet?".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=94, 116}} In 1968, the group's interest in [[transcendental meditation]] led them to record the original song, "[[Transcendental Meditation (song)|Transcendental Meditation]]".{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=215}}

Brian Wilson's artistic control over the Beach Boys' records was unprecedented for the time.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=54–55}} Carl Wilson elaborated: "Record companies were used to having absolute control over their artists. It was especially nervy, because Brian was a 21-year-old kid with just two albums. It was unheard of. But what could they say?

===California sound===
{{Main|California sound}}
[[File:The Beach Boys 1963 Billboard 2.png|thumb|The Beach Boys appearing in a 1963 ''Billboard'' advertisement]]
Professor of cultural studies James M. Curtis wrote in 1987: "We can say that the Beach Boys represent the outlook and values of [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|white Protestant Anglo-Saxon]] teenagers in the early sixties. Having said that, we immediately realize that they must mean much more than this. Their stability, their staying power, and their ability to attract new fans prove as much."{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=101}} Historian [[Kevin Starr]] explains that the group first connected with young Americans specifically for their lyrical interpretation of a mythologized landscape: "Cars and the beach, surfing, the California Girl, all this fused in the alembic of youth: Here was a way of life, an iconography, already half-released into the chords and multiple tracks of a new sound."{{sfn|Starr|2009|p=373}} In critic [[Robert Christgau]]'s opinion, "the Beach Boys were a touchstone for real rock and rollers, all of whom understood that the music had its most essential roots in an innocently hedonistic materialism".<ref name="Christgau1975"/>

The group's "California sound" grew to prominence through the success of their 1963 album ''Surfin' U.S.A.'',{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=32}} which helped turn the surfing subculture into a mainstream youth-targeted advertising image exploited by the film, television, and food industry.{{sfn|May|2002|pp=114–115}} The group's surf music was not entirely their invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=13}} However, previous surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach Boys did.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=193}} The band's earlier surf music helped raise the profile of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for [[Southern California]], as opposed to [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]].{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=103}} California supplanted New York as the center of popular music thanks to the success of Brian's productions.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=54–55}}

A 1966 article discussing trends in rock music writes that the Beach Boys popularized a type of drum beat heard in [[Jan and Dean]]'s "[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]", which sounds like "a locomotive getting up speed", in addition to the method of "suddenly stopping in between the chorus and verse".<ref name="nasal"/> [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] coined the term "[[power pop]]", which he defined as "what we play—what the [[Small Faces]] used to play, and the kind of pop the Beach Boys played in the days of 'Fun, Fun, Fun' which I preferred".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Altham |first=Keith |title=Lily Isn't Pornographic, Say Who |magazine=[[NME]] |issue=May 20, 1967}}</ref>

The California sound evolved to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature worldview, becoming less to do with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=61–62, 83}} Throughout the 1960s, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as [[sexual freedom]], [[black pride]], [[drugs]], [[Opposition (politics)|oppositional politics]], other [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] motifs, and [[war]].{{sfn|Shuker|1994|p=35}} Soft pop, later known as "[[sunshine pop]]", derived in part from this movement.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=69}} Sunshine pop producers imitated the orchestral style of ''Pet Sounds''; however, the Beach Boys were rarely representative of the genre, which was rooted in [[easy listening]] and advertising [[jingle]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/sunshine-pop-54224|title=Gateways to Geekery: Sunshine Pop|last1=Murray|first1=Noel|date=April 7, 2011|work=[[The A.V.

By the end of the 1960s, the California sound declined due to a combination of the West Coast's cultural shifts, Wilson's psychological downturn, and the Manson murders, with David Howard calling it the "sunset of the original California Sunshine Sound&nbsp;... [the] sweetness advocated by the California Myth had led to chilling darkness and unsightly rot".{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=84}} Drawing from the Beach Boys' associations with Manson and former California governor Ronald Reagan, Erik Davis remarked: "The Beach Boys may be the only bridge between those deranged poles. There is a wider range of political and aesthetic sentiments in their records than in any other band in those heady times—like the state [of California], they expand and bloat and contradict themselves."<ref name="Davis1990"/>

During the 1970s, advertising jingles and imagery were predominately based on the Beach Boys' early music and image.{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=8}} The group inspired the development of the West Coast style later dubbed "[[yacht rock]]". According to ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]''{{'}}s Dan O'Sullivan, the band's aesthetic was the first to be "scavenged" by yacht rock acts like [[Rupert Holmes]]. O'Sullivan cites the Beach Boys' recording of "Sloop John B" as the origin of yacht rock's preoccupation with the "sailors and beachgoers" aesthetic that was "lifted by everyone, from [[Christopher Cross]] to [[Eric Carmen]], from '[[Buffalo Springfield]]' folksters like [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] to '[[Philly Sound]]' rockers like [[Hall & Oates]]".<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Dan|title="California Über Alles": The Empire Yachts Back|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/09/the-yacht-rock-counterrevolution/|work=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=September 4, 2012|access-date=December 28, 2019|archive-date=November 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115210504/https://jacobinmag.com/2012/09/the-yacht-rock-counterrevolution/|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to David Leaf in 1978, ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Good Vibrations'' "established the group as the leaders of a new type of pop music, [[Art Rock]]".{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=74}} Academic [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] states that the band opened a path in rock music "that went from ''Sgt. Pepper's'' to ''[[Close to the Edge (Yes album)|Close to the Edge]]'' and beyond". He argues that the advancing technology of [[multitrack recording]] and [[mixing board]]s were more influential to experimental rock than [[electronic instruments]] such as the [[synthesizer]], allowing the Beatles and Beach Boys to become the first crop of non-[[classically trained]] musicians to create extended and complex compositions.{{sfn|Martin|2015|p=75}} In ''Strange Sounds: Offbeat Instruments and Sonic Experiments in Pop'', Mark Brend writes:
{{blockquote|Other artists and producers, notably the Beatles and Phil Spector, had used varied instrumentation and multi-tracking to create complex studio productions before. And others, like [[Roy Orbison]], had written complicated pop songs before. But "Good Vibrations" eclipsed all that came before it, in both its complexity as a production and the liberties it took with conventional notions of how to structure a pop song.{{sfn|Brend|2005|p=19}} }}

The production of "Good Vibrations" was unprecedented in any prior genre or recording;{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=55}} Carlin wrote that it "sounded like nothing that had ever been played on the radio before".{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=95–96}} It contained previously untried mixes of instruments, and was the first successful pop song to have cellos in a juddering rhythm.{{sfn|Brend|2005|pp=18–19}} [[Charlie Gillett]] called it "one of the first records to flaunt studio production as a quality in its own right, rather than as a means of presenting a performance".{{sfn|Gillett|1984|p=329}} Brian used Electro-Theremin for the track. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins while increasing awareness of [[analog synthesizer]]s, leading [[Moog Music]] to produce their own brand of [[ribbon controller|ribbon-controlled]] instruments.{{sfn|Pinch|Trocco|2009|pp=102–103}}{{refn|group=nb|Even though the Electro-Theremin was not technically a theremin, the song became the most frequently cited example of the theremin in pop music.{{sfn|Brend|2005|p=16}}}} In a 1968 editorial for ''[[Jazz & Pop]]'', Gene Sculatti predicted that the song "may yet prove to be the most significantly revolutionary piece of the current rock renaissance&nbsp;... In no minor way, 'Good Vibrations' is a primary influential piece for all producing rock artists; everyone has felt its import to some degree".<ref name="scullati" />

Discussing ''Smiley Smile'', Daniel Harrison argues that the album could "almost" be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that the group's innovations in the language of rock can be compared to those that introduced [[atonality|atonal]] and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. "The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable&nbsp;... as it is in, say, [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s [[Drei Klavierstücke (Schoenberg)|op.&nbsp;11 piano pieces]]."{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=47}} However, such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically-minded at the time.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=59}} Harrison concludes: "What influences could these innovations then have? The short answer is, not much. ''Smiley Smile'', ''Wild Honey'', ''Friends'', and ''20/20'' sound like few other rock albums; they are ''sui generis''.&nbsp;... It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation."{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=59}} Musicologist [[David Toop]] placed the Beach Boys' innovations alongside [[Les Baxter]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[King Tubby]], and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ocean-of-sound-mw0000538713|title=Ocean of Sound – David Toop|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 11, 2014|archive-date=February 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204174743/http://www.allmusic.com/album/ocean-of-sound-mw0000538713|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Sunflower'' marked an end to the experimental songwriting and production phase initiated by ''Smiley Smile''.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} After ''Surf's Up'', Harrison wrote, their albums "contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead", until 1974, "the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock 'n' roll act and became an oldies act".{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}}

In the 1970s, the Beach Boys served a "totemic influence" on [[punk rock]] that later gave way to [[indie rock]].

Diversity is a credo of Roger Williams University, which is why they chose to celebrate this moment in the band's history.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGaw|first=Jim|title=Friday, Sept. 22 will be 'Beach Boys Day' in Portsmouth|newspaper=The Portsmouth Times/Rhody Beat|url=http://rhodybeat.com/stories/friday-sept-22-will-be-beach-boys-day-in-portsmouth,27261|date=September 17, 2017|access-date=November 23, 2021|archive-date=November 23, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211123152632/http://rhodybeat.com/stories/friday-sept-22-will-be-beach-boys-day-in-portsmouth,27261|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Roger Williams University / Al Gomes and Connie Watrous of Big Noise Plaque|url=http://www.bignoisenow.com/images/artistphotos2018/BeachBoysRWUplaque.pdf|date=September 21, 2017|publisher=Big Noise|access-date=November 23, 2021|archive-date=November 23, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211123152627/http://www.bignoisenow.com/images/artistphotos2018/BeachBoysRWUplaque.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>
