==History==
===Early years===
The origins of the band began with [[Andrew Farriss]] convincing his fellow [[Davidson High School (New South Wales)|Davidson High School]] classmate, [[Michael Hutchence]], to join his band, Doctor Dolphin.<ref name="Burn">{{Cite book |title=Burn : The life and times of Michael Hutchence and INXS |last=St John |first=Ed |publisher=Bantam Books, Sydney |year=1998 |isbn=0-7338-0182-X }}</ref> The band contained two further classmates, Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders, as well as [[Garry Gary Beers|Garry Beers]] and Geoff Kennely, both from a nearby high school, [[The Forest High School (New South Wales)|Forest High School]].<ref name="Burn"/> In 1977, [[Tim Farriss]], Andrew's older brother, invited Andrew, Hutchence and Beers to join him and his schoolmate [[Kirk Pengilly]]. Tim and Pengilly had been playing together since 1971 as either an acoustic duo, Kirk and Tim, or as a four-piece band called Guinness<ref name="Burn"/> (named after their bass player's dog).<ref name="s2s">{{Cite book |title=INXS Story to Story: The official autobiography |last=Bozza |first=Anthony |publisher=Bantam Books, Sydney |year=2005 |isbn=0-593-05517-9 }}</ref> Together with younger brother [[Jon Farriss]] they formed "The Farriss Brothers", who consisted of Garry Beers on bass guitar, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar, Michael Hutchence on lead vocals and Kirk Pengilly on guitar and saxophone.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/><ref name=mhbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelhutchenceinfo.com/biography.htm |title=Biography – Michael Kelland John Hutchence|website=Michaelhutchenceinfo.com |access-date=5 March 2008}}</ref> The band made their debut on 16 August 1977 at [[Whale Beach, New South Wales|Whale Beach]],<ref name="Jeff">{{Cite book |url=http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an41896781 |title=Molly Meldrum presents 50 years of rock in Australia |last=Jenkins |first=Jeff |author2=Ian Meldrum |year=2007 |publisher=Wilkinson Publishing |location=Melbourne |isbn=978-1-921332-11-1 |access-date=17 November 2008 }}</ref> 40&nbsp;km (25&nbsp;mi) north of Sydney.<ref name="Jeff"/>

The parents of the Farriss boys relocated to [[Perth]], Western Australia in 1978, taking Jon to continue his schooling and as soon as Hutchence and Andrew finished school, the rest of the band followed.<ref name="Howl"/><ref name="Jeff"/> They briefly performed as The Vegetables, singing "We Are the Vegetables", before returning to Sydney ten months later,<ref name="Jeff"/> where they recorded a set of demos.<ref name="Burn"/> At a chance meeting in the car park of the Royal Antler, a pub in [[Narrabeen, New South Wales|Narrabeen]] on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, New South Wales, Tim was approached by Gary Morris who was the manager of [[Midnight Oil]].<ref name="Burn"/>

The band began to regularly support Midnight Oil and other local bands. Morris advised that a member of the Oils crew had come up with a new name and suggested they change it to INXS.<ref name="Burn"/> The name INXS was inspired by English band [[XTC]] and Australian jam makers [[Henry Jones IXL|IXL]].<ref name="Howl"/><ref name="Jeff"/> Pengilly later explained that Morris was interested in turning the group into a [[Christians|Christian]] band, which the band briefly considered before rejecting the idea.<ref name="Burn"/>

The band's first performance as INXS was on 1 September 1979 at the Ocean Beach Hotel in [[Umina, New South Wales|Umina]]<ref name="Take40Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.take40.com/artists/1458/inxs/bio |title=INXS bio |publisher=Take 40 |access-date=17 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907062646/http://www.take40.com/artists/1458/inxs/bio |archive-date=7 September 2008 }}</ref> on the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] of [[New South Wales]] and by the end of 1979, after passing on the Christian band image, they hired [[Chris Murphy (manager)|Chris "CM" Murphy]] as their manager and continued taking on the Australian pub circuit.<ref name="Howl"/><ref name="s2s"/><ref name="Jeff"/><ref>{{Cite book |last=St John |first= Ed |author2=INXS |title=INXS: The Official Inside Story of a Band on the Road |year=1992 |publisher=Mandarin |page=20 |isbn=1-86330-207-7}}</ref> Murphy was an adept business manager and negotiator and by early 1980 the band had signed a five-album record deal with a Sydney independent label, Deluxe Records, run by Michael Browning, a former manager of [[AC/DC]].<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/><ref name="Burn"/>

===1980s===
====From "Simple Simon" to ''Shabooh Shoobah''====
{{See also|INXS (album)|Underneath the Colours|Shabooh Shoobah}}
INXS released their first single, "[[Simple Simon (INXS song)|Simple Simon]]"/"[[Simple Simon (INXS song)|We Are the Vegetables]]", in Australia and France in May 1980.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="s2s"/><ref name=BandRoadChronology1>{{Cite book |last=St John |first= Ed |author2=INXS |title=INXS: The Official Inside Story of a Band on the Road |year=1992 |publisher=Mandarin |page=74 |isbn=1-86330-207-7 }}</ref> The single had its debut TV performance on ''[[Simon Townsend's Wonder World]]''.<ref name="Jeff"/> Their debut album, ''[[INXS (album)|INXS]]'', was recorded at Trafalgar Studios in [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]], Sydney. It was co-produced by the band and Duncan McGuire (ex-[[Ayers Rock (band)|Ayers Rock]]), with all songs attributed to the entire band, at the insistence of Murphy.<ref name="Burn"/><ref name="s2s"/> Deluxe gave them a budget of $10,000 to record the album, so to keep within the budget they had to record from midnight to dawn, usually after doing one or more performances earlier that night.<ref name="s2s"/> The album was released in October 1980. It featured "Just Keep Walking" which was their first Australian Top 40 single,<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Kent"/> with the album peaking in the Top 30 of the [[Kent Music Report]] for Australian albums.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="Kent"/> The album eventually went [[List of music recording sales certifications|gold]] (selling over 35,000 units) but it took a number of years to do so.<ref name="Burn"/>

These early records demonstrated their [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[ska]]/pop style, and were followed by near constant touring with almost 300 shows during 1981 as the band developed their status as a live act.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/> In 1981, they signed Gary Grant as their tour manager, who then became co-manager a year later.<ref name="Burn"/> Between touring commitments, the band released their third single in May 1981, "[[The Loved One (song)|The Loved One]]", which was a cover of a 1966 song by Australian group [[The Loved Ones (Australian band)|the Loved Ones]]. The song was recorded at Studios 301 in [[Sydney]];<ref name="Burn"/> it was produced by [[Richard Clapton]]<ref name="ARDb"/> and peaked in the Top 20.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Kent"/><ref name="BandRoadChronology1"/>

The success of the single led to Clapton and the band returning to Studios 301 between July and August 1981 to create an album. In October 1981, their second album ''[[Underneath the Colours]]'' was released and became a hit in Australia peaking at No.&nbsp;15.<ref name="Kent"/>

Soon after recording sessions had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Beers, Jon and Andrew Farriss played on Clapton's solo album, ''The Great Escape''. Hutchence recorded "Speed Kills", written by [[Don Walker (musician)|Don Walker]] of [[Cold Chisel]] for the soundtrack of the film ''Freedom'' directed by [[Scott Hicks (director)|Scott Hicks]]. It was his first solo single and was released by [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] in early 1982.<ref name="Burn"/> In January, INXS toured New Zealand as support act for [[Cold Chisel]]. Murphy eventually became convinced their future no longer lay with Deluxe Records.

Deluxe had been unable to attract international interest so the band decided to record a new song, "[[The One Thing (INXS song)|The One Thing]]" at their own expense, with [[Mark Opitz]] at Paradise Studios.<ref name="Burn"/> The song turned out so well that Murphy hired Opitz to produce three more songs.<ref name="s2s"/> Murphy approached [[Warner Music Group|WEA Australia]] with copies of the song, leading to INXS signing a recording deal in July 1982 with WEA for releases in Australia, South East Asia, Japan, New Zealand, [[Atco Records]] (a subsidiary of [[Atlantic Records]]) for North America, and [[PolyGram]] for Europe including the UK.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/><ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="Burn"/>

Murphy and the band were not entirely convinced that Opitz could produce an entire album that would attract international interest, so before recording their third album Pengilly, Hutchence, and Andrew Farriss visited the United Kingdom and USA, with a view to selecting a suitable producer, only to find that no one they wanted was available and that most people advised them that Opitz's work on their single was as good as they could wish for.<ref name="Burn"/>

To complete the band's contract with DeLuxe Records, INXS produced their first compilation album, [[INXSIVE]], released in early 1982 for the Australian market only, featuring highlights from the band's first two studio albums, related B-sides, and two non-album singles.

In mid-1982 they began recording at Rhinoceros Studios with Opitz.<ref name="ARDb"/> In October 1982, ''[[Shabooh Shoobah]]'' was released internationally on Atlantic/Atco Records, peaking at No.&nbsp;52 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and No.&nbsp;46 on the [[Top Pop Catalog Albums|Hot Pop Albums]] chart.<ref name=BBalbums/><ref name="AMGAlbums">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/276451/inxs/chart|title=Chart history|website=Billboard.com|access-date=7 October 2016}}</ref> In Australia it peaked at No.&nbsp;5 and remained in the albums charts for 94 weeks.<ref name="Kent"/> The single "The One Thing" brought them their first Top 30 hit in United States peaking at No.&nbsp;30 on 28 May 1983,<ref name="BillBoard The 80s">{{Cite book |last=Whitburn |first= Joel |title=Billboard Hot 100 Charts: The Eighties |year=1991 |publisher=Record Research Inc. |isbn=0-89820-079-2}}</ref> It was also a Top 20 hit in Canada,<ref name=AMGSingles/> and peaked at No.&nbsp;14 in Australia on 23 August 1982.<ref name="Kent"/> "One Thing" was their first video to air on the fledgling MTV and significantly added to the ultimate success of the single.<ref name="s2s"/>

13 February 1983, saw INXS play the [[Stop The Drop]] nuclear disarmament concert to 14,000 at the Myer Music Bowl in [[Melbourne]], alongside [[Midnight Oil]], [[Colin Hay]], [[Redgum]] and [[Goanna (band)|Goanna]]. It was simulcast on Australian TV by Channel 10 and Radio 2MMM.

INXS undertook their first US performance in [[San Diego]] in March 1983, to a crowd of 24 patrons.<ref name="Burn"/> Their first tour was as support for [[Adam and the Ants]], then support for [[Stray Cats]], [[The Kinks]],<ref name="McF"/> and [[Hall & Oates]] followed by [[The Go-Go's]].<ref name="Burn"/><ref name="s2s"/> INXS played alongside many of their contemporaries on New Wave Day in May 1983 at the ''[[US Festival]]'' in [[Devore, San Bernardino]], California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/blackmarketclash/Bands/Clash/recordings/1983/83-05-28_SanBerdino/83-05-28_SanBerdino.html |title=The Clash US Festival May&nbsp;28th 1983 |website=Blackmarketcash.com |access-date=6 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307000302/http://homepage.mac.com/blackmarketclash/Bands/Clash/recordings/1983/83-05-28_SanBerdino/83-05-28_SanBerdino.html |archive-date=7 March 2008 }}</ref> During that time, their co-manager Gary Grant relocated permanently to New York City to ensure a continual presence in the northern hemisphere.<ref name="Burn"/> The band remained on the road in the US for most of the year, including support for [[Men at Work]] and by mid-1983 were headlining venues such as [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York.<ref name="Burn"/>

====From "Original Sin" to ''Listen Like Thieves''====
{{See also|The Swing (INXS album)|Listen Like Thieves}}
After a performance in [[Toronto]] the band was approached by producer [[Nile Rodgers]]; by September 1983, the band had recorded "[[Original Sin (INXS song)|Original Sin]]" (originally entitled "Brand New Day") at New York's Power Station Studios.<ref name="Burn"/> Three tracks from ''Shabooh Shoobah'' were featured in the soundtrack for the 1984 film ''[[Reckless (1984 film)|Reckless]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/review/product/6301977602|title=Highly Overlooked 80s movie|date=26 September 2006|author=Kathy Curtis|website=Amazon.com|access-date=6 March 2008|archive-date=16 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016235033/https://www.amazon.com/review/product/6301977602|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band then travelled to the UK to begin sessions on their fourth album with [[Nick Launay]] at [[the Manor Studio]]s in [[Oxford]].<ref name="Burn"/>

The album ''[[The Swing (INXS album)|The Swing]]'', released in April 1984,<ref name="ARDb"/> received significant attention from around the world, as "Original Sin" became the band's first No.&nbsp;1 single in Australia and was popular worldwide with fans and reviewers.<ref name=OSreview>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t374177|pure_url=yes}} |title=Original Sin > Song Review|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Ned Raggett|access-date=7 March 2008}}</ref> During 1984, the single reached no. 1 in Australia (for two weeks in January),<ref name="Kent"/> [[Argentina]], and France; No.&nbsp;6 in New Zealand; No.&nbsp;11 in Canada; No.&nbsp;23 in Switzerland;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=INXS&titel=Original+Sin&cat=s |title=INXS – Original Sin|website=Australian-charts.com|access-date=7 March 2008}}</ref> No.&nbsp;31 in the [[Netherlands]]; and No.&nbsp;58 in the U.S.<ref name=AMGSingles /> However, "Original Sin" was largely ignored in the UK, and INXS would not have any Top 50 chart success in the United Kingdom until the 1985 album ''[[Listen Like Thieves]]''.<ref name="UKCharts">{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/ |title=INXS Singles and Albums Charts |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=20 November 2008 }}</ref>

During 1984, INXS toured non-stop, performing across Europe, the UK, the US and Australia. By December 1984, ''The Swing'' had gone [[List of music recording sales certifications|double platinum]], making it one of the five biggest domestic albums in the history of Australian music at the time.<ref name="Burn"/>

In March 1985, the band returned to Sydney's Rhinoceros Studios and recorded the Listen Like Thieves album along with producer [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] (the [[Sex Pistols]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[the Pretenders]], [[Elton John]]).<ref name="Burn"/> As the band was finishing the recording sessions, Thomas stated that the album was not good enough and still had no "killer" track. Andrew produced a demo tape of a [[funk music|funk]] song he had been working on called "Funk Song No.&nbsp;13" and evolved it into "[[What You Need (INXS song)|What You Need]]".<ref name="Burn"/>
