===Success in the 1950s and 1960s===
On November 20, 1955, Diddley appeared on the popular television program ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. According to legend, when someone on the show's staff overheard him casually singing "[[Sixteen Tons]]" in the dressing room, he was asked to perform the song on the show. One of Diddley's later versions of the story was that upon seeing "Bo Diddley" on the cue card, he thought he was to perform both [[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|his self-titled hit single]] and "Sixteen Tons".<ref name="Austen2005">{{cite book |last1=Austen |first1=Jake |title=TV-a-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol |date=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=978-1-56976-241-7 |pages=14–15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYa5olqdl4UC&pg=PA14 |language=en}}</ref> Sullivan was furious and banned Diddley from his show, reputedly saying that he would not last six months.

Diddley's hit singles continued in the 1950s and 1960s: "[[Pretty Thing]]" (1956), "[[Say Man]]" (1959), and "[[You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover]]" (1962). He also released numerous albums, including ''Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger'' and ''Have Guitar, Will Travel''. These bolstered his self-invented legend.<ref name="SoundsShow"/> Between 1958 and 1963, [[Checker Records]] released eleven full-length Bo Diddley albums. In the 1960s, he broke through as a crossover artist with white audiences (appearing at the [[Alan Freed]] concerts, for example),<ref name="SoundsShow"/> but he rarely aimed his compositions at teenagers. Diddley was among those musicians who capitalized on the mid-1960s surfing and beach party craze in the United States, and released the albums ''[[Surfin' with Bo Diddley]]'' and '' Bo Diddley's Beach Party''.<ref name="Komara2006" /> These featured heavy, distorted blues, played on his [[Gretsch]] guitar with bended notes and minor key riffs, unlike the clean, undistorted sounds of the Fender guitars used by the California surf bands.

After moving from Chicago to Washington, D.C., Diddley built his first [[home recording]] studio in the basement of his home at 2614 Rhode Island Avenue NE.

Diddley performed a number of shows around the country in 2005 and 2006, with fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson]] and his band, consisting of Johnson on keyboards, Richard Hunt on drums and Gus Thornton on bass.

==Accolades==
Bo Diddley was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded a [[Doctor of Fine Arts]] degree by the [[University of Florida]] for his influence on American popular music. In its ''People in America'' radio series, about influential people in American history, the [[Voice of America]] radio service paid tribute to him, describing how "his influence was so widespread that it is hard to imagine what rock and roll would have sounded like without him." [[Mick Jagger]] stated that "he was a wonderful, original musician who was an enormous force in music and was a big influence on the Rolling Stones. He was very generous to us in our early years and we learned a lot from him". Jagger also praised the late star as a one-of-a-kind musician, adding, "We will never see his like again".<ref name="Mick">{{cite web|url=http://showbizspy.com/news/06032008/mick-jagger-leads-tribute-for-diddley|title=Mick Jagger Leads Tribute for Diddley|last=Wenn|date=June 3, 2008|work=showbizspy.com|access-date=October 27, 2008|archive-date=November 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122030542/http://www.showbizspy.com/news/06032008/mick-jagger-leads-tribute-for-diddley|url-status=live}}</ref> The documentary film ''[[Cheat You Fair: The Story of Maxwell Street]]'' by director [[Phil Ranstrom]] features Bo Diddley's last on-camera interview.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxwellstreetdocumentary.com|title=Cheat You Fair: The Story of Maxwell Street|publisher=Maxwellstreetdocumentary.com|access-date=April 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103041025/http://www.maxwellstreetdocumentary.com/|archive-date=January 3, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Beat ==
{{Main|Bo Diddley beat}}
The "Bo Diddley beat" is essentially the [[clave rhythm]], one of the most common [[bell pattern]]s found in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]].<ref>Peñalosa, David (2010: 244). ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins''. Redway, California: Bembe. {{ISBN|1-886502-80-3}}.</ref> One scholar found this rhythm in 13 rhythm and blues recordings made in the years 1944–55, including two by [[Johnny Otis]] from 1948.<ref>Tamlyn, Garry Neville (1998). ''The Big Beat: Origins and Development of Snare Backbeat and Other Accompanimental Rhythms in Rock 'n' Roll''. PhD thesis. Table 4.16. page 284.</ref>

Bo Diddley gave different accounts of how he began to use this rhythm. [[Ned Sublette]] says, "In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], 'Bo Diddley' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'Rhumba' on the track sheets."<ref>Sublette, Ned (2007: 83). "The Kingsmen and the Cha-cha-chá." Ed. Eric Weisbard. ''Listen Again: A Momentary History of Pop Music''. Duke University Press. {{ISBN|0822340410}}.</ref> The Bo Diddley beat is similar to "[[Juba dance|hambone]]", a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms, legs, chest, and cheeks while chanting rhymes.<ref>Roscetti, Ed (2008). ''Stuff! Good Drummers Should Know''. Hal Leonard Corporation. p. 16. {{ISBN|1-4234-2848-X}}.</ref> Somewhat resembling the [[Shave and a Haircut|"shave and a haircut, two bits"]] rhythm, Diddley came across it while trying to play [[Gene Autry]]'s "(I've Got Spurs That) [[Jingle, Jangle, Jingle]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/multi/feature/ID/298/Blues+Reflections:+2003 |title=Blues Reflections |publisher=Afropop.org |date=April 3, 1970 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605102906/http://www.afropop.org/multi/feature/ID/298/Blues+Reflections:+2003 |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Three years before his "Bo Diddley", a song with similar syncopation titled "Hambone" was cut by the [[Red Saunders (musician)|Red Saunders]] Orchestra with the Hambone Kids. In 1944, "[[Rum and Coca Cola]]", containing the Bo Diddley beat, was recorded by the [[the Andrews Sisters|Andrews Sisters]]. Many  recordings after Diddley’s successes, such as [[Buddy Holly]]'s "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]" (1957) and [[Them (band)|Them's]] "[[Mystic Eyes]]" (1965) used the beat.<ref name="Sixties">Hicks, Michaël (2000). ''Sixties Rock'', p.36. {{ISBN|978-0-252-06915-4}}.</ref>
[[File:Bo Diddley beat.png|thumb|280px|right|"Bo Diddley beat"<ref name="Sixties" />/[[Son clave]] {{audio|Bo Diddley beat.mid|Play}}.]] In its simplest form, the Bo Diddley beat can be counted out as either a one-bar or a two-bar phrase. Here is the count as a one-bar phrase: '''One''' e and '''ah''', two e '''and''' ah, three e '''and''' ah, '''four''' e and ah (the boldface counts are the [[Clave (rhythm)|clave]] rhythm).

Many songs (for example, "[[Hey Bo Diddley]]" and "[[Who Do You Love?

In one of the most well-known of his 1958 doo-wop sessions, Diddley added harmonies by the Carnations recording as the Teardrops, who sang smooth, polished doo-wop in the backgrounds on the songs "I'm Sorry", "Crackin' Up", and "Don't Let it Go".<ref name="Pruter1996" />

An influential guitar player, Bo Diddley developed many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack, particularly the "shimmering" tremolo sound,<ref name="Larson2004" /><ref name="Schiller2019">{{cite book |last1=Schiller |first1=David |title=Guitar: The World's Most Seductive Instrument |year=2019 |publisher=Workman Publishing |isbn=978-1-5235-0850-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnKHDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44 |language=en}}</ref> and amp reverb. His trademark instrument was his self-designed, one-of-a-kind, rectangular-bodied "Twang Machine" (referred to as "cigar-box shaped" by music promoter [[Dick Clark]]), built by [[Gretsch]]. He had other uniquely shaped guitars custom-made for him by other manufacturers throughout the years, most notably the "Cadillac" and the rectangular "Turbo 5-speed" (with built-in envelope filter, flanger and delay) designs, made by Tom Holmes (who also made guitars for ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, among others). In a 2005 interview on [[Triple J|JJJ]] radio in Australia, he implied that the rectangular design sprang from an embarrassing moment. During an early gig, while jumping around on stage with a [[Gibson L5]] guitar, he landed awkwardly, hurting his groin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/boone_m1035862.mp3 |title=Mp3 file : Jay and the Doctor |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=March 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624195337/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/boone_m1035862.mp3 |archive-date=June 24, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/bodidleytw_m1035870.mp3 |title=Mp3 file : Jay and the Doctor |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=March 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624195333/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/bodidleytw_m1035870.mp3 |archive-date=June 24, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He then went about designing a smaller, less-restrictive guitar that allowed him to keep jumping around on stage while still playing his guitar. He also played the violin, which is featured on his mournful [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] "The Clock Strikes Twelve", a [[twelve-bar blues]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/buyersguides/gr/diddleymasters.htm |title=Bo Diddley – I'm a Man: The Chess Masters, 1955–1958 – CD review |publisher=Oldies.about.com |date=February 25, 2008 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075606/http://oldies.about.com/od/buyersguides/gr/diddleymasters.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Diddley often created lyrics as witty and humorous adaptations of [[folk music]] themes. His first hit, "Bo Diddley", was based on [[Juba dance|hambone]] rhymes.<ref name="Wald2014">{{cite book |last1=Wald |first1=Elijah |title=Talking 'bout Your Mama: The Dozens, Snaps, and the Deep Roots of Rap |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-939404-3 |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9gVDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA87 |language=en}}</ref> The first line of his song "Hey Bo Diddley" is derived from the nursery rhyme "[[Old MacDonald]]".<ref name="Elliott2017">{{cite book |last1=Elliott |first1=Richard |title=The Sound of Nonsense |year=2017 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-1-5013-2456-7 |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzI7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT84 |language=en}}</ref> The song "Who Do You Love?" with its [[roots of hip hop|rap]]-style boasting, and his use of the African-American game known as "[[the dozens]]" on the songs "Say Man" and "Say Man, Back Again," are cited as progenitors of hip-hop music;<ref name="Aquila2016">{{cite book |last1=Aquila |first1=Richard |title=Let's Rock!: How 1950s America Created Elvis and the Rock and Roll Craze |year=2016 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4422-6937-8 |page=229 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=340xDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA229 |language=en}}</ref> for example, in the dialogue of the song, "Say Man", percussionist Jerome Green says the lines: "You've got the nerve to call somebody ugly.
