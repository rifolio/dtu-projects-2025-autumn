'''James Newell Osterberg Jr.''' (born April 21, 1947), known professionally as '''Iggy Pop''', is an American singer, musician, songwriter, actor and radio broadcaster. He was the vocalist and lyricist of [[proto-punk]] band [[the Stooges]], who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited many times since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iggypop.org/coachella2003.html |title=The Stooges Reuinion at Coachella 2003 |website=iggypop.org |access-date=December 27, 2014}}</ref> Often called the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Godfather of Punk]]",<ref>"But somewhere between his last album, "[[Naughty Little Doggie]]", and his latest one, "[[Avenue B (album)|Avenue B]]", the godfather of punk turned 50 ...", in {{Citation |last=Christman |first=Ed |title=Iggy Pop opens a 'window into the soul' on Virgin's contemplative 'Avenue B' |date=August 7, 1999 |newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=111 |page=14 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref><ref>"Looking remarkably healthy for a man who nurtured a world-class drug habit for many years, the "Godfather of Punk" Iggy Pop is set to close the Other Stage on Saturday night." in {{Citation |title=Godfather of punk still has lust for life |date=June 5, 2007 |newspaper=[[Western Daily Press]] |page=30}}</ref> he was named one of the ''[[50 Great Voices]]'' by [[NPR]] due to his distinctive voice.

Initially playing a raw, primitive style of [[rock and roll]] (progressing later towards more experimental and aggressive rock), the Stooges sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which sometimes involved acts of [[self-mutilation]] by Pop.<ref name=all>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-stooges-mn0000562304/biography | title=The Stooges biography | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=July 15, 2015 | last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas| author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine }}</ref> He had a long collaborative relationship and friendship with [[David Bowie]] over the course of his career, beginning with the Stooges' album ''[[Raw Power]]'' in 1973. Both musicians went to [[West Berlin]] to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions and Pop began his solo career by collaborating with Bowie on the 1977 albums ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]'' and ''[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)|Lust for Life]]'', Pop usually contributing the lyrics. He was one of the first performers to do a [[stage-dive]] and popularized the activity.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |title=The Evolution of Stage Diving |date=October 25, 2018 |url=http://kcpr.org/2018/10/25/evolution-of-stage-diving/ |publisher=KCPR |access-date=February 16, 2019 |archive-date=February 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216212127/http://kcpr.org/2018/10/25/evolution-of-stage-diving/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Brooklyn Rail" /> Pop, who traditionally (but not exclusively) performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass. 

Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career, including [[garage rock]], [[punk rock]], [[hard rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[art rock]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[grunge]], [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/iggy-pop/43705 |title=Iggy Pop announces release date for 'jazz' album |work=NME |date=March 26, 2009 |access-date=September 30, 2011}}</ref><ref name="electronic">{{Cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/iggy-pop-underworld-ep/ |title=Iggy Pop Announces EP With Electronic Group Underworld |last=Kielty |first=Martin |date=June 25, 2018 |website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> Though his popularity has fluctuated, many of Pop's songs have become well known, including "[[Search and Destroy (The Stooges song)|Search and Destroy]]" and "[[I Wanna Be Your Dog]]" by the Stooges, and his solo hits "[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop song)|Lust for Life]]", "[[The Passenger (song)|The Passenger]]" and "[[Real Wild Child (Wild One)]]". In 1990, he recorded his only Top 40 U.S. hit, "[[Candy (Iggy Pop song)|Candy]]", a duet with [[the B-52s]]' singer [[Kate Pierson]]. Pop's song "[[China Girl (song)|China Girl]]" became more widely known when it was re-recorded by co-writer Bowie, who released it as the second single from his most commercially successful album, ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983). Bowie re-recorded and performed many of Pop's songs throughout his career.

Although Pop has had limited commercial success, he has remained a cultural icon and a significant influence on a wide range of musicians in numerous genres.

Osterberg began to play drums in the fifth grade, first starting with rubber pads glued to plywood, before his parents bought him a drum set.<ref name=":0" /> In a 2007 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, he explained his relationship with his parents and their contribution to his music:

==Music career==
===Early days: 1960–1967===
[[File:Primemoverslive.gif|thumb|The Prime Movers, featuring Pop on drums]]
Osterberg began his music career as a drummer in various high school bands in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], including [[The Iguanas (Michigan band)|the Iguanas]], who covered several records such as [[Bo Diddley]]'s "[[Mona (I Need You Baby)|Mona]]" in 1965.<ref name="Ankeny (Iguanas)">{{cite web|last1=Ankeny|first1=Jason|title=The Iguanas: Artist Biography|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-iguanas-mn0002295191/biography|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=July 26, 2015}}</ref> He then began exploring local [[blues]]-style bands such as [[The Prime Movers (Michigan band)|the Prime Movers]] (with brothers Dan and [[Michael Erlewine]]), which he joined at 18 years old.

Osterberg eventually dropped out of the [[University of Michigan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/arts/iggy-pop-and-ann-arbor |title=Searching in Ann Arbor for the origins of Iggy Pop |publisher=MichiganDaily.com |date=April 17, 2011 |access-date=April 29, 2015}}</ref> and moved to Chicago to learn more about blues. While in Chicago, he played drums in blues clubs, helped by [[Sam Lay]] (formerly of the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]]) who shared his connections with Pop.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.iggypop.org/iggyinterviews.html |title =Weasel interviews Iggy Pop |date = December 1980 |access-date = January 14, 2009 |publisher = [[WDCH-FM|WHFS]], Bethesda, MD, USA}}</ref> Inspired by [[Chicago blues]] as well as bands like [[the Sonics]], [[MC5]] and [[the Doors]], he formed [[The Stooges|the Psychedelic Stooges]].

Their first show was played at a Halloween party at a house in Detroit, Michigan. Members of the MC5 were also in attendance. Osterberg became interested in Ron Asheton after seeing him perform in the Chosen Few (a covers band), believing "I've never met a convincing musician that didn't look kind of ill and kind of dirty, and Ron had those two things covered!"<ref>{{cite web|date=March 30, 2010|title=The Stooges: Iggy Pop Interview &#124; Clash Music Exclusive Interview|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/the-stooges-iggy-pop-interview|access-date=July 1, 2011|publisher=Clashmusic.com}}</ref> The three nicknamed Osterberg "Pop" after a local character named Jim Popp,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Trynka |first=Paul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzsQOEvDGOoC&dq=iggy+pop+jim+popp&pg=PA83 |title=Iggy Pop: Open Up and Bleed: A Biography |date=April 8, 2008 |publisher=Crown |isbn=978-0-7679-2320-0 |pages=83 |language=en}}</ref> who he was said to have resembled after shaving his eyebrows.<ref name="Mojo161a">Paul Trynka''Meet Ze Monster'' Mojo No.&nbsp;161, April 2007</ref>

=== The Stooges era: 1968–1974 ===
The seeds of Pop's stage persona were sown when he saw [[the Doors]] perform in 1967 at the University of Michigan and was amazed by the stage antics and antagonism displayed by singer [[Jim Morrison]].<ref name="Brooklyn Rail" /> Morrison's extreme behavior, while performing in a popular band, inspired the young Pop to push the boundaries of stage performance. Other influences on Pop's vocals and persona were [[Mick Jagger]] and [[James Brown]]:

{{blockquote|I attended two concerts by the Doors. The first one I attended was early on and they had not gotten their shit together yet. That show was a big, big, big influence on me. They had just had their big hit, "[[Light My Fire]]" and [[The Doors (album)|the album]] had taken off. ... So, here's this guy, out of his head on [[lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]], dressed in leather with his hair all oiled and curled. The stage was tiny and it was really low. It got confrontational. I found it really interesting. I loved the performance ... Part of me was like, "Wow, this is great. He's really pissing people off and he's lurching around making these guys angry." People were rushing the stage and Morrison's going "Fuck you. You blank, blank, blank." You can fill in your sexual comments yourself. The other half of it was that I thought, "If they've got a hit record out and they can get away with this, then I have no fucking excuse not to get out on stage with my band." It was sort of the case of, "Hey, I can do that." There really was some of that in there.<ref>Wright, Jeb. [http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/show_interview.php?id=97 Irritatingly Interesting: An Interview with Iggy Pop"] classicrockrevisited</ref>}}

In addition to Jim Morrison and the Doors' influence on the band, Pop also attributes the Stooges getting jump-started after seeing an all-girl rock band from [[Princeton, New Jersey]], called the Untouchable. In a 1995 interview with ''[[Bust (magazine)|Bust]]'', he relates:

{{blockquote|And the other thing was we went to New York. We had gone to New York a couple of months before that just to check out the scene, and we had never been to a place like New York ... we went down around Eighth Street there where all the young tourists hang out, and we met these girls from New Jersey, from Princeton, they had a band called The Untouchable, and we're like, "Oh, you've got a band, sure, ha ha ha," and they said "Well, come to our house and see us play." And we didn't have anywhere to crash, and they played for us, and they completely rocked, and we were really ashamed.}}

In 1968, one year after their live debut and now dubbed [[the Psychedelic Stooges]], the band signed with [[Elektra Records]], again following in the footsteps of the Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (according to Pop, guitarist [[Ron Asheton]] called [[Moe Howard]] to see if it was all right to call the band "The Stooges", to which Howard responded by merely saying "I don't care what they call themselves, as long as they're not [[The Three Stooges|The ''Three'' Stooges]]!" and hung up the phone). Pop himself told the story in the 2016 Jim Jarmusch documentary film about the Stooges, ''[[Gimme Danger]]''. The Stooges' first album ''[[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges]]'' (on which Pop was credited as "Iggy Stooge") was produced by [[John Cale]] in New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up, ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'', produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of ''Fun House'' did not receive the recognition expected, it was later ranked No. 191 in ''Rolling Stone's'' '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-stooges-fun-house-20120524 "500 Greatest Albums of All Time: The Stooges: ''Fun House''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615032549/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-stooges-fun-house-20120524 |date=June 15, 2018 }} ''Rolling Stone''. November 2003.</ref> Shortly after the release of ''Fun House'', the group disbanded because of Pop's worsening [[heroin addiction]].

In 1971, without a record deal, the Stooges kept performing in small clubs with a five-piece lineup that included both Ron Asheton and [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] on guitars and Jimmy Recca on bass, Pop having fired Dave Alexander the previous year when he turned up for a gig unable to play because of his chronic alcoholism. That year Pop and [[David Bowie]] met at [[Max's Kansas City]], a nightclub and restaurant in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.maxskansascity.com/bowie/ |title = David Bowie and Iggy Pop Meet at Max's Kansas City |date = September 17, 2008 |access-date = September 17, 2008 |publisher = Max's Kansas City |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927100333/http://www.maxskansascity.com/bowie/ |archive-date = September 27, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref> Pop's career received a boost from his relationship with Bowie when Bowie decided in 1972 to produce an album with him in England. With Williamson signed on as guitarist, the search began for a [[rhythm section]]. However, since neither Pop nor Williamson were satisfied with any players in England, they decided to re-unite the Stooges. Ron Asheton grudgingly moved from guitar to bass. The recording sessions produced the rock landmark ''[[Raw Power]]''. After its release, [[Scott Thurston]] was added to the band on keyboards/electric piano and Bowie continued his support, but Pop's [[drug abuse|drug problem]] persisted. The Stooges' last show in 1974 ended in a fight between the band and a group of [[motorcycling|bikers]], documented on the album ''[[Metallic K.O.]]'' Drug abuse stalled Pop's career again for several years.

[[File:Iggy Pop in Toronto 1977.jpg|thumb|Iggy Pop performing in Toronto, 1977]]

After the Stooges' second breakup, Pop made recordings with James Williamson, but these were not released until 1977 (as ''[[Kill City]]'', credited jointly to Pop and Williamson).<ref name="HodgkinsonPetridis">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/11/iggy-and-the-stooges-raw-power|title=The world was not ready for Iggy and the Stooges|last1=Hodgkinson|first1=Will|last2=Petridis|first2=Alexis|date=March 11, 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=February 16, 2018}}</ref> Pop was unable to control his [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and checked himself into a [[mental institution]], the [[UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute]], to try to clean up. Bowie was one of his few visitors, continuing to support his friend and collaborator. In 1976, Bowie took Pop as his companion on the ''[[Station to Station]]'' tour. This was Pop's first exposure to large-scale professional touring, and he was impressed, particularly with Bowie's work ethic. Following a March 21, 1976, show, Bowie and Pop were arrested together for [[marijuana]] possession in [[Rochester, New York]], although charges were later dropped.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/rocroots/2016/01/11/david-bowie-rochester-arrest-march-1976/78619818/ |date=January 11, 2016 |title=When Rochester arrested David Bowie |author=<!--Not stated-->|newspaper=Rochester Democrat & Chronicle |access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref>

Bowie and Pop relocated to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions. "Living in a Berlin apartment with Bowie and his friends was interesting…" Pop recalled. "The big event of the week was Thursday night. Anyone who was still alive and able to crawl to the sofa would watch ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]''."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Michael|last=Odell|title=Ten Commandments|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|issue=258|date=January 2008|page=162}}</ref>

[[File:Iggy-Pop 1977.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Iggy Pop on October 25, 1977, at the State Theatre in Minneapolis]]

In 1977, Pop signed with [[RCA Records]]. Bowie helped write and produce ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]'' and ''[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)|Lust for Life]],'' Pop's two most acclaimed albums as a solo artist, the latter featuring one of his best-known songs, "[[The Passenger (song)|The Passenger]]". ''[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)|Lust for Life]]'' featured another team of brothers, [[Hunt Sales|Hunt]] and [[Tony Fox Sales]], sons of comedian [[Soupy Sales]]. Among the songs Bowie and Pop wrote together were "[[China Girl (song)|China Girl]]", "[[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]", and "[[Red Money|Sister Midnight]]", all of which Bowie performed on his own albums later (the last being recorded with different lyrics as "[[Red Money]]" on ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''). Bowie also played keyboards in Pop's live performances, some of which are featured on the album ''[[TV Eye Live 1977|TV Eye Live]]'' in 1978. In return, Pop contributed backing vocals on Bowie's ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/david-bowie-133-1195103|title=Iggy Pop says David Bowie saved him from 'annihilation'|last=Britton|first=Luke Morgan|date=January 13, 2016|website=NME|access-date=May 29, 2019}}</ref>

"Artistically, I really like those two records, ''The Idiot'' and ''Lust for Life''," Pop said. "But I was personally just miserable… David was a really good friend to me in many ways, but… he had [[Berlin Trilogy|his whole thing]] going on and a whole apparatus of people around him, and problems that he had to face. For more than a year, I lived in the room next door, and I had a good friendship, but it wasn't the same as being in [[The Stooges|a band]]."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Keith|last=Cameron|title=Jack & Iggy|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|issue= 119 |date= October 2003 |page= 98}}</ref>

===Arista albums: 1979–1981===
[[File:IggyPop1979.jpg|thumb|upright|Iggy Pop in Cardiff, 1979]]

Pop had grown dissatisfied with RCA, later admitting that he had made ''TV Eye Live'' as a quick way of fulfilling his three-album RCA contract. He moved to [[Arista Records]], under whose banner he released ''[[New Values]]'' in 1979. This album was something of a Stooges reunion, with James Williamson producing and latter-day Stooge [[Scott Thurston]] playing guitar and keyboards. Not surprisingly, the album's style harkened back to the guitar sound of the Stooges. ''New Values'' was not a commercial success in the U.S. but has since been highly regarded by critics.

The album was moderately successful in Australia and New Zealand, however, and this led to Pop's first visit there to promote it. While in Melbourne, he made a memorable appearance on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s nationwide show ''[[Countdown (music show)|Countdown]]''. During his anarchic performance of "I'm Bored", Pop made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was [[lip-synch]]ing (shoving the microphone down his pants at one point), and he even tried to grab the teenage girls in the audience. He was also interviewed by host [[Molly Meldrum]], an exchange which was frequently punctuated by the singer jumping up and down on his chair and making loud exclamations of "G'day mate" in a mock [[Australian accent]]. His ''Countdown'' appearance is generally considered one of the highlights of the show's history and it cemented his popularity with Australian punk fans, since then he has often toured there. While visiting New Zealand, Pop recorded a music video for "I'm Bored" and attended a record company function where he appeared to slap a woman and throw wine over a photographer.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Jane|last=Clifton|title=Iggy Pop Sets Tour Scene|magazine=The Dominion|date=July 16, 1979}}</ref> While in Australia, Pop was also the guest on a live late-night commercial TV interview show on the [[Ten Network]]. The ''Countdown'' appearance has often been re-screened in Australia.

During the recording of ''[[Soldier (album)|Soldier]]'' (1980), Pop and Bowie argued with Williamson over various aspects of the project. Williamson recalled, "I was not at all happy with a number of aspects of that record including the band, the material and the recording facilities. So I was unhappy in general and vice versa".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i94bar-dev.info/ints/james-williamson09.html|title=The Barman talks to James Williamson of Iggy the and Stooges at the I-94 Bar|last=Barman|website=i94bar-dev.info|access-date=May 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311174729/http://i94bar-dev.info/ints/james-williamson09.html|archive-date=March 11, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Williamson left the project. Bowie appeared on the song "Play it Safe", performing backing vocals with the group [[Simple Minds]]. During a live performance in Brooklyn in 1981, Pop smashed a microphone into his own face, knocking out a front tooth.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/behind-the-scenes-on-the-pirelli-calendar-iggy-pop-cher-and-st-vincent-pose-for-bryan-adams-1.4640528|title=Behind the scenes on the Pirelli calendar: Iggy Pop, Cher and St Vincent pose for Bryan Adams

Both ''Soldier'' and its follow-up ''[[Party (Iggy Pop album)|Party]]'' (1981) were commercial failures, and Pop was dropped from Arista.

===1980s===
[[File:Iggy Pop - pinkpop87.jpg|thumb|upright|Iggy Pop at the [[Pinkpop Festival]] in 1987]]

In 1980, Pop published his autobiography ''I Need More'', co-written with Anne Wehner, an Ann Arbor arts patron. The book, which includes a selection of black and white photographs, featured a foreword by [[Andy Warhol]]. Warhol wrote that he met Pop when he was Jim Osterberg, at the Ann Arbor Film Festival in 1966. "I don't know why he hasn't made it really big," Warhol wrote. "He is so good."<ref>{{cite book |title=I Need More: The Stooges and Other Stories |last1=Pop |first1=Iggy |last2=Wehner |first2=Anne |chapter=Foreword by Andy Warhol |year=1982 |page=7 |publisher=Karz-Cohl Publishing |isbn=978-0-943828-50-3}}</ref>

The 1982 album ''[[Zombie Birdhouse]]'' on [[Chris Stein]]'s Animal label, with Stein himself producing, was no more commercially successful than his Arista works. In 1983, Pop's fortunes changed when David Bowie recorded a cover of the song "China Girl". The song had originally appeared on ''The Idiot'' and was a major hit on Bowie's blockbuster ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' album. As co-writer of the song, Pop received substantial [[royalties]]. On ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' in 1984, Bowie recorded five more of their co-written songs (2 from ''Lust for Life'', 1 from ''New Values'', and 2 new songs), assuring Pop financial security, at least for the short term. The support from Bowie enabled Pop to take a three-year break, during which he overcame his resurgent heroin addiction and took acting classes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hilburn |first1=Robert |title=IGGY POP'S BACK WITH A NEW IMAGE AND 'BLAHS' |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-30-ca-8466-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |date=October 30, 1986 |access-date=October 15, 2020}}</ref>

Additionally, Pop contributed the title song to the 1984 film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'' (with [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], previously of the [[Sex Pistols]], on guitar, and [[Nigel Harrison]] and [[Clem Burke]], both of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] on bass and drums) as well as an instrumental called "Repo Man Theme" that was played during the opening credits.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iggy Pop Talks Repo Man |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2744-iggy-pop-talks-repo-man |website=Criterion |access-date=January 9, 2020}}</ref>

In 1985, Pop recorded some demos with Jones. He played these demos for Bowie, who was sufficiently impressed to offer to produce an album for Pop: 1986's [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced ''[[Blah-Blah-Blah (Iggy Pop album)|Blah-Blah-Blah]]'', featuring the single
"[[Wild One (Johnny O'Keefe song)|Real Wild Child]]", a cover of "The Wild One", originally written and recorded by Australian rock 'n' roll musician [[Johnny O'Keefe]] in 1958. The single was a Top 10 hit in the UK and was successful around the world, especially in Australia, where it has been used since 1987 as the theme music for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s late-night music video show ''[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]''. ''Blah-Blah-Blah'' was Pop's highest-charting album in the U.S. since ''The Idiot'' in 1977, peaking at No. 75 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.

Also in 1985, Pop and [[Lou Reed]] contributed their singing voices to the animated film ''[[Rock & Rule]]''. Pop performed the song "Pain & Suffering" in the final sequence of the film.<ref>{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Casey |title=Rock & Rule |url=http://www.dvddrive-in.com/reviews/n-s/rockandrule83.htm |website=Dvddrive-in.com|access-date=July 1, 2007}}</ref> Pop's music appeared on the soundtrack to the 1986 film ''[[Dogs in Space]]''.

In 1987, Pop appeared (along with [[Bootsy Collins]]) on a mostly instrumental album, ''[[Neo Geo (album)|Neo Geo]]'', by Japanese composer [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]. The music video for "Risky", written and directed by Meiert Avis, won the first MTV Breakthrough Video Award. {{Citation needed|date=March 2021|reason=No evidence provided on this page or Sakamoto's page}} The groundbreaking video explores [[wikt:transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosopher [[FM-2030]]'s ideas of ''Nostalgia for the Future'' in the form of an imagined love affair between a robot and one of [[Man Ray]]'s models in Paris in the late 1930s. Additional inspiration was drawn from [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Edvard Munch]]'s 1894 painting ''Puberty'', and [[Roland Barthes]] ''[[Death of the Author]]''. The surrealist black-and-white video uses stop motion, light painting, and other retro in-camera effects techniques. Meiert Avis recorded Sakamoto while at work on the score for ''The Last Emperor'' in London. Sakamoto also appears in the video painting words and messages to an open shutter camera. Pop, who performs the vocals on "Risky", chose not to appear in the video, allowing his performance space to be occupied by the surrealist era robot.

Pop's follow-up to ''Blah Blah Blah'', ''[[Instinct (Iggy Pop album)|Instinct]]'' (1988), was a turnaround in musical direction. Its stripped-back, guitar-based sound leaned further towards the sound of the Stooges than any of his solo albums to date. His record label dropped him, but the ''[[King Biscuit Flower Hour]]'' radio show recorded the ''Instinct'' tour (featuring guitarist [[Andy McCoy]] and [[Alvin Gibbs]] on bass) in Boston on July 19, 1988. Working with rock attorney Stann Findelle, Pop scored more movie soundtrack inclusions in 1989: "Living on the Edge of the Night" in the [[Ridley Scott]] thriller ''[[Black Rain (American film)|Black Rain]]''; and "Love Transfusion", a song originally written by [[Alice Cooper]] (who does backing vocals) and [[Desmond Child]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://evenspot.com/html.folder/CDreview/AC_Soundtrack/Shocker.html |title=Alice Cooper Soundtracks |publisher=Evenspot.com |access-date=May 4, 2013 |archive-date=March 31, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331225050/http://evenspot.com/html.folder/CDreview/AC_Soundtrack/Shocker.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> in ''[[Wes Craven's Shocker]]''. Also, at the same time, Pop, dissatisfied from RCA's decisions, revoked copyrights of his RCA releases, assigned it to his company ''Thousand Mile'', and signed a contract with [[Virgin Records]], which was a unique hybrid of distribution deal for his RCA releases and a recording contract for new albums. Virgin first reissued ''Lust for Life'' and ''The Idiot'' in 1990, then ''TV Eye Live 1977'' in 1994.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Pop recorded ''[[Brick by Brick]]''. The album was produced by [[Don Was]] and featured members of [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[the B-52's]] as guests. His ''Kiss My Blood'' video (1991) was directed by [[Tim Pope]] and filmed at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in Paris. The video attracted much controversy, as it included footage of Pop performing with his penis exposed to the audience. ''Brick by Brick'' featured his first Top 40 U.S. hit, "[[Candy (Iggy Pop song)|Candy]]", a duet with B-52's singer [[Kate Pierson]].

Also in 1990, Pop sang the role of "The Prosecutor" for the [[POINT Music]]/[[Philips Records|Philips Classics]] recording (released in 1992) of composer [[John Moran (composer)|John Moran]]'s multimedia opera<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffel|first=Margaret Ross |title=Operas in English: A Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8bQAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|access-date=October 30, 2017|date=December 21, 2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8325-3|page=300|author-link= Margaret Ross Griffel}}</ref> ''The Manson Family''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/20-great-iggy-pop-collaborations-20160317/john-moran-the-manson-family-an-opera-1990-20160317|title=20 Great Iggy Pop Collaborations: John Moran, 'The Manson Family: An Opera' (1990)|last=Harris|first=Keith|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 17, 2016|access-date=October 30, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107024313/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/20-great-iggy-pop-collaborations-20160317/john-moran-the-manson-family-an-opera-1990-20160317|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/17/arts/will-the-manson-story-play-as-myth-operatically-at-that.html?pagewanted=all|title=Will the Manson Story Play As Myth, Operatically at That?|last=Kaznin|first=Allan|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 17, 1990|access-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref> That year he also contributed to the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' project, singing a version of "[[Well Did You Evah! (1990)|Well Did You Evah!]]" in a duet with [[Debbie Harry]].

In the early to middle 1990s, Pop would make several guest appearances on the [[Nickelodeon]] show ''[[The Adventures of Pete and Pete]]''. He played James Mecklenberg, Nona Mecklenberg's father.

In 1991, Pop and Kirst contributed the song "Why Was I Born (Freddy's Dead)" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]''. The song also plays over the end credits of the film, with a compilation of clips from the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series running alongside the end credits. In the same year, Pop sang a leading role in the [[John Moran (composer)|John Moran]] opera ''The Manson Family''.

In 1992, he collaborated with [[Goran Bregović]] on the [[Arizona Dream (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the movie ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' by [[Emir Kusturica]]. Pop sang four of the songs: ''In the Deathcar'', ''TV Screen'', ''Get the Money'', and ''This is a Film''. Also in 1992, he collaborated with the New York City band [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]]. He recorded spoken word vocals on the intro and outro of the song "[[Black Sunshine]]" as well as playing the character of a writer in the video shot for the song.

In 1993, Pop released ''[[American Caesar (album)|American Caesar]]'', including two successful singles, "Wild America" and "Beside You". The following year Pop contributed to [[Buckethead]]'s album ''[[Giant Robot (Buckethead album)|Giant Robot]]'', including the songs "Buckethead's Toy Store" and "Post Office Buddy". He appears also on the [[Les Rita Mitsouko]] album ''[[Système D]]'' where he sings the duet "My Love is Bad" with [[Catherine Ringer]].

In 1996, Pop again found mainstream fame when his 1977 song "[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop song)|Lust for Life]]" was featured in the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''. A new video was recorded for the song, with clips from the film and studio footage of Pop dancing with one of the film's stars, [[Ewen Bremner]]. A Pop concert also served as a plot point in the film. The song has also been used in TV commercials for [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] and as the theme music to ''[[The Jim Rome Show]]'', a nationally syndicated American sports talk show.

In 1996, Pop released ''[[Naughty Little Doggie]]'' and the single "I Wanna Live". Pop was injured during a show in 1997 when he dove from the stage of the [[Polaris Amphitheatre]] and the crowd failed to catch him, resulting in a dislocated shoulder and tendon damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1997/07/08/moshing-incident-gets-the-better-of-iggy-pop/|title=Moshing incident gets the better of Iggy Pop|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=July 8, 1997|access-date=July 10, 2025}}</ref> Around this time, he [[remix]]ed ''Raw Power'' to give it a rougher, more hard-edged sound; fans had complained for years that Bowie's official "rescue effort" mix was muddy and lacking in bass. Pop testified in the reissue's liner notes that on the new mix, "everything's still in the red". Also in 1997, Pop was credited with the soundtrack to the film ''[[The Brave (film)|The Brave]]''.{{sfn|Parrill|2009|page=191}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwpJFOSyEmEC&pg=PT358|title=Gimme Danger: The Story of Iggy Pop|first=Joe|last=Ambrose|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|location=London|year=2002|isbn=978-0711991071}}</ref>{{sfn|Pomerance|2005|page=286}}

On January 1, 1998, Pop made a guest appearance on [[Paramount Television]]'s science fiction series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. Pop played a [[Vorta]] in an episode based upon the film ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', titled "[[The Magnificent Ferengi]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/iggy-pop-happy-birthday-star-trek-deep-space-nine-cameo/|title=Celebrate Iggy Pop's 73rd Birthday by Recalling His Guest Spot on ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine''|author=Rock Cellar Magazine Staff|magazine=Rock Cellar Magazine|publisher=Rock Cellar Productions|location=Los Angeles|date=April 21, 2020|access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref> Pop also contributed the theme song for ''[[Space Goofs]]''.

Pop co-produced his 1999 album ''[[Avenue B (album)|Avenue B]]'' with [[Don Was]], releasing the single "Corruption". Pop also sang on the 1999 [[Death in Vegas]] UK Top-10 single ''Aisha''. The same year he appeared on ''[[The End of Law|Hashisheen: The End of Law]]'', a collaborative effort by [[Bill Laswell]], reading on the tracks "The Western Lands" and "A Quick Trip to Alamut".

===The Stooges reunion: 2003–2010===
[[File:Iggy Pop (5).jpg|thumb|The Stooges at Sziget Festival 2006]]
Pop's 2003 album ''[[Skull Ring]]'' featured collaborators [[Sum 41]], [[Green Day]], [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]], and [[the Trolls]], as well as Ron and Scott Asheton, reuniting the three surviving founding members of [[the Stooges]] for the first time since 1974. Pop made a guest appearance on [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]]'s song "Kick It" as well as the video. Also in 2003, the first full-length biography of Pop was published. ''Gimme Danger – The Story of Iggy Pop'' was written by Joe Ambrose; Pop did not collaborate on the biography or publicly endorse it.

Having enjoyed working with the Ashetons on ''Skull Ring'', Pop reformed the Stooges, with bassist [[Mike Watt]] (formerly of [[The Minutemen (band)|the Minutemen]]) filling in for the late [[Dave Alexander (musician)|Dave Alexander]] and ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'' saxophonist [[Steve Mackay]] rejoining the lineup. That year, Pop opened [[Madonna]]'s ''Reinvention'' World Tour in Dublin.

Pop and the Stooges played the Glastonbury Festival in June 2007. Their set included material from the 2007 album ''The Weirdness'' and classics such as "No Fun" and "I Wanna Be Your Dog". Pop also caused controversy in June 2007 when he was interviewed on the [[BBC]]'s coverage of the [[Glastonbury Festival]]. He used the phrase "paki shop", apparently unaware of its racist connotations, prompting three complaints and an apology from the BBC.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6238680.stm|title=BBC 'sorry' for Iggy racist word|work=BBC News|date=June 25, 2007|access-date=July 2, 2007}}</ref>

On March 10, 2008, Pop appeared at [[Madonna]]'s induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf Astoria]] Hotel in New York. Together with the Stooges, he sang raucous versions of two Madonna hits, "[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]" and "[[Ray of Light]]". Before leaving the stage, he looked directly at Madonna, quoting "You make me feel shiny and new, like a virgin, touched for the very first time", from Madonna's hit song "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]". According to guitarist Ron Asheton, Madonna asked the Stooges to perform in her place, as a protest to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for not inducting the Stooges, despite six appearances on the nomination ballot.<ref name="freep.com">Brian McCollum {{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080310%2FENT04%2F80310062%2F&imw=Y |title=Why the Stooges performed for Madonna |access-date=April 9, 2017 |url-status=deviated |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314021804/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080310%2FENT04%2F80310062%2F&imw=Y |archive-date=March 14, 2008 }}. freep.com (March 10, 2008)</ref> Pop also sang on the "No Fun" cover by [[Asian Dub Foundation]] on their 2008 album ''[[Punkara]]''.

On January 6, 2009, original Stooges guitarist and Pop's self-described best friend [[Ron Asheton]] was found dead from an apparent heart attack. He was 60 years old.

In 2009, James Williamson rejoined the band after 29 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/03/12/early-retirement-helped-james-williamson-rejoin-the-stooges/ |title=Early Retirement Helped James Williamson Rejoin the Stooges |publisher=Spinner.com |date=March 12, 2010 |access-date=September 30, 2011 |archive-date=August 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812215331/http://www.spinner.com/2010/03/12/early-retirement-helped-james-williamson-rejoin-the-stooges/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On December 15, 2009, it was announced that the Stooges would be inducted into [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on March 15, 2010. Pop had "about two hours of a strong emotional reaction" to the news.<ref name=HallOfFame>Andy Green.

=== 2000s ===
Pop sang on the tracks "[[Rolodex Propaganda]]" and "Enfilade" by [[At the Drive-In]] in 2000. In 2001, he released ''[[Beat 'Em Up]]'', which gave birth to [[the Trolls]], releasing the single "Football" featuring Trolls alumni Whitey Kirst and brother Alex. Pop's music appeared on the soundtrack to the 2001 film ''[[He Died with a Felafel in His Hand (film)|He Died with a Felafel in his Hand]]''. In 2005, Pop appeared, along with Madonna, [[Little Richard]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and [[the Roots]]' [[Questlove]], in an American TV commercial for the [[Motorola ROKR]] phone. In early 2006, Pop and the Stooges played in Australia and New Zealand for the [[Big Day Out]]. They also began work on a new album, ''[[The Weirdness]]'', which was recorded by [[Steve Albini]] and released in March 2007. In August 2006, Pop and the Stooges performed at the [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands]] pop festival in the Netherlands, Hodokvas in [[Slovakia]] and in the [[Sziget Festival]] in [[Budapest]].

Author [[Paul Trynka]] completed a biography of Pop (with his blessing) called ''Open Up and Bleed'', published in early 2007. In February 2007, Pop and the Stooges played at [[Bam Margera]]'s [[Bam's Unholy Union|wedding]] and Pop appeared on the single "[[Punkrocker (song)|Punkrocker]]" with the [[Teddybears (band)|Teddybears]] in a [[Cadillac]] television commercial. Pop was also the voice of Lil' Rummy on the [[Comedy Central]] cartoon ''[[Lil' Bush]]'' and confirmed that he has done voices for ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'',<ref>[http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/04648031/iggy_pop_on_lil_bush_and_the_stooges.html Pop Pop on Lil' Bush and The Stooges] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228194914/http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/04648031/iggy_pop_on_lil_bush_and_the_stooges.html |date=December 28, 2013}}</ref> which also included the Stooges song "[[I Wanna Be Your Dog]]" (though the game's manual credited Iggy Pop as the artist).

[[File:Iggy Pop Memphis 2007.jpg|thumb|Iggy Pop at Beale Street Music Festival, [[Memphis in May]], 2007]]

Pop guested on ''[[Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness)|Profanation]]'', the new album by the [[Bill Laswell]]-helmed group [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]], which was released on January 1, 2008.

Pop collaborated with [[Danger Mouse (music producer)|Danger Mouse]] and [[Sparklehorse]] on the album ''Dark Night of the Soul'', singing the track "Pain".

Pop's fifteenth solo album, ''[[Préliminaires]]'', was released on June 2, 2009. Inspired by a novel by French author [[Michel Houellebecq]] called ''La Possibilité d'une île'' (2005; Trans. as ''[[The Possibility of an Island]]'' by Gavin Bowd, 2006), Pop was approached to provide the soundtrack for a documentary film on Houellebecq and his attempts to make a film from his novel. He describes this new release as a "quieter album with some jazz overtones", the first single off the album, "King of the Dogs", bearing a sound strongly influenced by [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]] musicians such as [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Jelly Roll Morton]]. Pop said that the song was his response to being "sick of listening to idiot thugs with guitars banging out crappy music". The album is available on legal download sites, CD, and a deluxe box set is available at only 6000 units worldwide. This box set contains the ''Préliminaires'' album, a collector "Les Feuilles Mortes" b/w "King of the Dogs" 7&nbsp;inch, the cover of which is Pop's portrait by [[Marjane Satrapi]], and a 38-page booklet of drawings also by Marjane Satrapi.

In January 2009, Pop was signed up as the face of [[Swiftcover]], the UK-based online insurance company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/871141/Iggy-Pop-fronts-Swiftcover-insurance-ad |title=Iggy Pop fronts Swiftcover insurance ad – Brand Republic News |work=Brand Republic |date=January 6, 2009 |access-date=September 8, 2010}}</ref> He fronted a £25&nbsp;million TV ad campaign for [[Swiftcover]], using the strapline "Get a Life".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easier.com/view/Finance/Insurance/Car/article-224426.html |title=Iggy Pop to front £25&nbsp;million car insurance ad campaign |publisher=Easier |date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=September 8, 2010}}</ref> The advert was then banned by the Advertising Standards Authority on April 28, 2009, for being misleading – it implied that Pop himself had an insurance policy with Swiftcover when at the time the company did not insure musicians.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8023358.stm |work=BBC News |title=Iggy Pop advert deemed misleading |date=April 28, 2009 |access-date=April 2, 2010}}</ref>
