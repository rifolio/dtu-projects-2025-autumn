'''Keane''' are <!-- ("They are") Please note that British English uses the plural "are" instead of the Americanised singular "is" --> an English [[alternative rock]] band from [[Battle, East Sussex]], formed in 1995. The band comprises [[Tom Chaplin]] (lead vocals, guitar, piano), [[Tim Rice-Oxley]] (piano, synthesisers, bass guitar, backing vocals), Richard Hughes (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and [[Jesse Quin]] (bass guitar, guitar, backing vocals). Their original line-up included founder and guitarist [[Dominic Scott]], who left in 2001. 

Keane achieved mainstream international success with the release of their debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004. Topping the [[UK Albums Chart]], the album won the [[Brit Awards|2005 Brit Award]] for [[2005 Brit Awards|Best British Album]] and was the UK's second-best-selling album of 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2005|title=The BRITs 2005|website=Brits.co.uk|access-date=27 September 2014|archive-date=7 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807024523/http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2005|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling albums in UK chart history]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-biggest-studio-albums-of-all-time__24431/|title=The UK's Top 40 biggest studio albums of time|last=Copsey|first=Rob|date=13 October 2018|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=18 September 2019}}</ref> Their second album, ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), topped the UK chart and debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. They released their third album ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' in 2008, and followed it with the 2010 EP ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]''. Their fourth studio album ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' was released in 2012 and peaked at number one in the UK. 

The band went on hiatus after the release of their compilation album ''[[The Best of Keane]]'' (2013). They returned in 2019 with "The Way I Feel", the lead single from their fifth studio album, ''[[Cause and Effect (Keane album)|Cause and Effect]]'' (2019). The band then embarked on the Cause and Effect Tour, visiting Europe and Latin America, before the remainder of the tour was postponed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

Keane are known for using keyboards as the lead instrument instead of guitar, differentiating them from most other rock bands.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|last=Youngs|first=Ian|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3363889.stm|title=Sound of 2004 winners: Keane|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=7 August 2008 | date=9 January 2004}}</ref> The inclusion of a distorted piano effect in 2006 and various synthesisers was a common feature in their music<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/keane/22621|title=Keane explain their new sound|work=NME|date=28 March 2006|access-date=19 August 2006}}</ref><ref name="Shore">{{cite web|last=Odell |first=Michael |url=http://keane.at/articles/041.htm |title=The Shore Thing (Annotated) |work=[[Q magazine]] |date=1 May 2004 |pages=48–52 |access-date=24 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013211302/http://keane.at/articles/041.htm |archive-date=13 October 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which developed on the second and third albums.

==History==

===1995–99: Early years and formation===
Tom Chaplin and Tim Rice-Oxley became friends at an early age.<ref name="Strangers">''[[Strangers (video)|Strangers]]'' Keane DVD autobiography.</ref> Chaplin's father David was the headmaster of [[Vinehall School]] in Robertsbridge, East Sussex (owned by Chaplin's family) for 25 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinehall.info/website/about/history.html |title=Vinehall School History |access-date=22 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618231118/http://www.vinehall.info/website/about/history.html |archive-date=18 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the school all three attended until the age of 13. They later attended [[Tonbridge School]] in [[Kent]], where Rice-Oxley met [[Dominic Scott]]; both discovered their liking for music. [[Richard Hughes (musician)|Richard Hughes]], Keane's future drummer, also attended Tonbridge. Chaplin had learned to play the flute, but none considered music as a proper career at the time.<ref name="book">{{Cite book|last=Craic|first=Seamus|title=Keane: The Band|publisher=Artnik|date=31 January 2006|isbn=1-903906-64-4<!-- (UK)-->}}</ref>

In 1995, while studying at University College London, Rice-Oxley formed a rock band with Scott and invited Hughes to play drums.<ref name="Shore" /> The band, named Lotus Eaters, started as a cover band, playing songs by the members' favourite bands. After listening to Rice-Oxley's piano playing during a weekend at [[Virginia Water]], Surrey, in 1997, [[Chris Martin]] invited him to join his newly formed band [[Coldplay]]. However, Rice-Oxley declined because he did not want to leave The Lotus Eaters, stating "I was seriously interested, but Keane were already operational and Coldplay's keyboard player idea was dropped."<ref name="Shore" /> Because of Martin's offer, and although Hughes and Scott were originally opposed to it, Chaplin joined the band in 1997, taking Rice-Oxley's place as vocalist and adding himself as the acoustic guitarist. Chaplin's recruitment also marked a change of name from the Lotus Eaters to Cherry Keane after a friend of Chaplin's mother, whom Rice-Oxley and Chaplin knew when they were young. At her death from cancer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keanemusic.com |title=Keanemusic – Tom Chaplin's blog, 28.06.07 |access-date=7 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060612214136/http://www.keanemusic.com/ |archive-date=12 June 2006 }}</ref> she had left money for Chaplin's family. Chaplin commented: "I used some of the money to see me through the harder times with the music." The name was shortened to Keane soon afterward.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chapman|first=Tegan|url=http://www.greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/327/2/|title=Keane man on success, songs and Steve Lamacq|website=Greatreporter.com|date=13 January 2005|archive-date=13 June 2010|access-date=19 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613182546/http://www.greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/327/2|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Chaplin departed for South Africa in Summer 1997 to work as a volunteer during his [[gap year]].<ref name="Strangers" /> Chaplin's early experiences there later were reflected in the band's position for the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign. Returning a year later, in July 1998, following a meeting with friend David Lloyd Seaman, Hughes' first words when the band picked up Chaplin at the airport were "we've got a gig in 10 days."<ref name="book" /> With original material, Keane made their debut live appearance at the [[Hope and Anchor, Islington|Hope & Anchor]] pub on 13 July 1998. In this same year, Chaplin went to Edinburgh University to study for a degree in art history.<ref name="book" /> However, he later quit his degree and moved to London to pursue a full-time musical career.<ref name="Shore" /><ref name="book" /> After their debut performance, the band went touring London's pub gig circuit throughout 1998 and 1999.

===1999–2003: Early releases and Scott's departure===
In late 1999, and without a record deal, Keane recorded their first promotional single "[[Call Me What You Like (Keane song)|Call Me What You Like]]". Released on CD format through Keane's label Zoomorphic, it was sold after live performances at the pubs where Keane used to play in early 2000. Only 500 copies were printed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Discography - Call Me What You Like|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/disco/zoo_call.htm|website=Keaneshaped.co.uk|access-date=16 September 2006}}</ref> The EP was reviewed by Bec Rodwell from ''eFestivals'' who listed "[[Call Me What You Like (Keane song)|Closer Now]]" as the best song of the record.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bec.|url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/misc/reviews/keaneEP-010525.shtml|title=Keane : "Call Me What You Like" EP Review|work=eFestivals.com.uk|date=25 May 2001|access-date=12 September 2006}}</ref> Recording for the band's next release began on 28 October 2000.{{r|ancient}} At the start of 2001, Rice-Oxley and Hughes disclosed that the main recording would be "Wolf at the Door," and that it would be completed soon.{{r|ancient}} The band gave progress updates. Hughes recorded drums in late January, and the final recording session was in February.{{r|ancient}} Mixing took place in April.{{r|ancient}} The single was released in June, and only 50 copies are known to have been made, using unlabeled [[CD-R]]s.{{r|Wolf|r={{cite web|title=Discography - Wolf At The Door|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/disco/zoo_wolf.htm|website=Keaneshaped.co.uk|access-date=4 August 2006}}}}

Both singles are considered highly valuable collector's items by fans. In particular, "Wolf at the Door" has been known to be sold for over [[Pound sterling|£]]1000 on eBay.{{r|Wolf}} During production of "Wolf at the Door," the band recorded and released other songs as demos, namely "More Matey," "Maps," "To the End of the Earth," "Allemande," "New One," "Russian Farmer's Song," and "Live in Fear."{{r|ancient}} The band have declared they are not against fans sharing tracks unreleased on CD, such as the demos "More Matey" and "Emily". Chaplin said "They most likely see those recordings as an interesting extra to get hold of— I don't see it causing any damage. If it was the album we have coming out {{bracket|([[Hopes and Fears]])}} leaked early, then I'd probably feel differently."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Kevin|date=2004-03-01|title=Making a Keane Break|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040413072100/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/content_objectid=13988483_method=full_siteid=50143_page=2_headline=-MAKING-A-KEANE-BREAK-name_page.html|website=Mirror Online|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/content_objectid=13988483_method=full_siteid=50143_page=2_headline=-MAKING-A-KEANE-BREAK-name_page.html|archive-date=2004-04-13}}</ref>

Dominic Scott decided to leave the band in July,{{r|ancient}} a month after "Wolf at the Door" was released, to continue his studies at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]].{{r|ancient|r={{cite web|title=Ancient Keaneology|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013210447/http://keane.at/staring/website-old.htm|website=Keane.at|date=2004|url=http://www.keane.at/staring/website-old.htm|archive-date=13 October 2006|access-date=19 September 2006}}}} Rice-Oxley referenced this departure in "[[This Is the Last Time]]," which was being rehearsed in May, according to Hughes.{{r|ancient}} Keane was invited by record producer James Sanger in July{{r|ancient}} to his property in Normandy, France, where the band recorded a number of tracks from August to November,{{r|ancient}} including "Sunshine," "[[This Is the Last Time]]," "Maps" (anew) and "Happy Soldier."{{r|rets-ep2|r={{cite web|title=New Retrospective EP Released|url=https://www.keanemusic.com/new-retrospective-ep-released/|website=keanemusic.com|date=2010-06-29|access-date=2022-12-23}}}} It was during these sessions that the idea of using a piano as lead instrument began to emerge.{{r|ancient}} Sanger received a shared credit for four songs that appeared on Keane's debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'', including "Sunshine", the only song composed there.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cashmere|first=Tim|url=http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/keane2004.html|title=Keane Undercover Music Interviews|access-date=19 August 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821170006/http://undercover.com.au/idol/keane2004.html|archive-date=21 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The band members returned to England in November.{{r|ancient}}

The band signed with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] to publish their music in April 2002,{{r|ancient}} and this enabled them to better commit to music,{{r|ancient}} but at this time they did not yet have a recording contract. Sometime in early 2002, Rice-Oxley wrote "[[Everybody's Changing]]."{{r|rets-ep1|r={{cite web|title=Retrospective EP1 on Sale|url=https://www.keanemusic.com/retrospective-ep1-on-sale/|website=keanemusic.com|date=2008-12-16|access-date=2022-12-23}}}} He played it for Chaplin, Hughes and people at BMG, and then the band developed the song into a demo completed in July.{{r|rets-ep1}} They also produced a demo of "Walnut Tree" completed in May.{{r|rets-ep2}} 2002 was a hard year for Keane.

Williams offered to release the first commercial single by the band. This release was "[[Everybody's Changing]]", which [[Steve Lamacq]] named single of the week on ''Lamacq Live'' on 14 April 2003, and came out as a CD single on 12 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/disco/fp_ec.htm|title=Discography – Everybody's Changing (Fierce Panda)|work=Keaneshaped.co| access-date =4 August 2006}}</ref> As a result of the attention created by this release and because of the strong live reputation they had built through constant UK touring, a bidding war for the band ensued among major record labels.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Hoyle|first=Wayne|url=http://www.virtual-festivals.com/artists/article.cfm?articleid=981|title=Keane Interview|date=14 April 2004| access-date =4 November 2006}}</ref> The band decided to sign with [[Island Records]] in summer 2003.

The band released "This Is the Last Time" on Fierce Panda, in October 2003 as the final release on that label.

===2004–05: ''Hopes and Fears'' and breakthrough===
[[File:Keane at Lowlands.jpg|thumb|right|Keane performing at the Lowlands Festival, 2004]] 

With the release of their first major single, Keane began to achieve recognition in the United Kingdom and the United States. In January 2004, Keane was named the band most likely to achieve success in the coming year in the BBC's [[Sound of...|Sound of 2004]] poll; additionally, this year is popularly referred to as one of the best years for new British music.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3369355.stm|title=Sound of 2004 music poll revealed|date=9 January 2004| access-date =10 September 2006 | work=BBC News}}</ref> A month later, Keane's first release on Island was "[[Somewhere Only We Know]]", which reached number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in February 2004. On 4 May, a re-release of "[[Everybody's Changing]]" followed and featured new B-sides and a new cover; it reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Official Singles Chart Top 100 {{!}} Official Charts Company |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/20040509/7501/ |access-date=2022-08-23 |website=Officialcharts.com |language=en}}</ref>

Keane's debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' was released on 10 May 2004 in the UK, a day before the band started their first world tour. It debuted at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and became the second best-selling British album of the year.

However, it gave credit to the album's "fine moments", praising lead single "[[Somewhere Only We Know]]" as "breathtaking".<ref>{{cite web |last=Future |first=Andrew |url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/3682/reviews/9594 |title=Album Review: Keane – Hopes and Fears / Releases / Releases // Drowned in Sound |work=Drowned in Sound |date=2004-05-13 |access-date=2014-05-10 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060954/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/3682/reviews/9594 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band won two awards at the 2005 [[BRIT Awards]] in February; Best British album for ''Hopes and Fears'', and the British breakthrough act award as voted for by listeners of [[BBC Radio 1]]. Three months after, Rice-Oxley received the [[Ivor Novello award]] for songwriter of the year.

As members of the [[Make Poverty History]], Keane performed "Somewhere Only We Know" and "Bedshaped" at the [[Live 8]] concert, which took place in London on 2 July 2005. Keane are also patrons of [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], and in September 2005, they recorded a cover version of [[Elton John]]'s "[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (song)|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]" to the charity album ''[[Help: a Day in the Life]]''.

===2006–07: ''Under the Iron Sea''===
[[File:Keane.JPG|thumb|right|Keane performing in 2007]] 

In April 2005, in the middle of the Hopes and Fears tour, the band began recording ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' with producer Andy Green, who worked with them on ''Hopes and Fears''. The band later recruited [[Mark 'Spike' Stent|Mark "Spike" Stent]] for mixing duties. Recording took place in Helioscentric Studios, where ''Hopes and Fears'' was recorded. Additional recording was done at [[Magic Shop (recording studio)|The Magic Shop]] in New York City. The album's release was preceded by the release of the "[[Atlantic (song)|Atlantic]]", a download-only music video and the lead single "[[Is It Any Wonder?]]", which reached number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] in 2007. The album had a worldwide release in June 2006 and was at number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] for the first two weeks of its release. {{As of|2007|05|22}}, it had sold more than 2.2 million copies. The third single from the album was "Crystal Ball", released on 21 August 2006, and reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart. The fourth single from the album was "[[Nothing in My Way]]", released on 30 October 2006, which received particular success on Mexican commercial radio, charting on Top 3 on 13 January 2007 and staying a month on that chart. The band released the single "[[The Night Sky]]" in aid of the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]].

Before the release of the album (in May 2006), Keane had started their second world tour. However, because of the extensive touring, on 22 August 2006, Chaplin announced he had admitted himself to a clinic for drinking and drug problems. This initially resulted in the cancellation of three gigs and postponement of their September tour.

Chaplin then left the Priory Clinic in London on 6 October, but he continued to receive treatment. The tour reached for the first time South American countries (Argentina, Chile and Brazil) and saw the band's third visit to Mexico in late April with four dates, playing at the downtown [[zócalo]] in Mexico City, as well their first visit to Monterrey and Guadalajara. On 7 July 2007, Keane played at the [[Live Earth concert, London|UK leg]] of [[Live Earth]] at Wembley Stadium, part of a series of gigs similar to [[Live 8]], to highlight the threat of global warming. They performed "Somewhere Only We Know", "Is It Any Wonder?" and "Bedshaped". The Under the Iron Sea tour was brought to an end with performances in Oporto, Portugal, and at the Natural Music Festival in El Ejido, Spain on 3 August and 4 respectively.

In 2008, ''Under the Iron Sea'' was voted the 8th best British album of all time by a poll conducted by ''Q'' Magazine and HMV.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7249473.stm |title=BBC Entertainment |work=BBC News |date=18 February 2008 |access-date=2012-08-26}}</ref> In early October, Concert Live announced they were releasing a limited edition nine-CD set of every Keane live performance in the UK during October 2006 under the name ''[[Live 06]]''.

In a March 2007 video interview, Chaplin and Hughes spoke of wanting to take a more "organic" approach on album three, but played down suggestions about the use of guitars, referring to them as "a fun part of the live set" at present; however, the cover of "[[A Bad Dream#She Sells Sanctuary|She Sells Sanctuary]]" became the first song recorded since "The Happy Soldier" (2001) to feature the instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stv.tv/content/out/music/display?id=opencms:/out/hotnow/music/keane_interview |title=Keane Interview |format=Video |work=[[STV (TV channel)|STV]] |access-date=14 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316100121/http://www.stv.tv/content/out/music/display?id=opencms%3A%2Fout%2Fhotnow%2Fmusic%2Fkeane_interview |archive-date=16 March 2007 }}</ref> Photographic updates to the Keane website implied the use of guitars in the album's recording sessions. [[Jesse Quin]] joined the band since this album as permanent studio and live member. He plays the bass, percussion, guitar, synths and backing vocals. On 25 August 2008, Keane appeared as studio guests on BBC 6 Music with [[Steve Lamacq]] where three of the new songs from ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' were played for the first time: "Spiralling", "The Lovers Are Losing", and "Better Than This".

The album was released on 13 October 2008, and reached number one on the UK Albums Chart on 19 October. It also reached number 7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. In December 2008, it was voted "Best Album of the Year" by the readers, listeners and visitors of Q Magazine, Q Radio and Qthemusic.com.<ref name="qalbum2008">{{cite web|url=http://promo.q4music.com/q4music/qbestof2008results/Keane.shtml |title=QTheMusic.com, Best Albums of 2008, number 1 |website=Promo.q4music.com |access-date=4 July 2011}}</ref> The song "Perfect Symmetry" was voted best track.<ref name="qtrack2008">{{cite web|url=http://promo.q4music.com/q4music/qbestof2008results/tracks.shtml |title=QTheMusic.com, Best Tracks of 2008 |website=Promo.q4music.com |access-date=4 July 2011}}</ref> In November 2008, they started the Perfect Symmetry World Tour. On 2 April 2009, Keane became the first band ever to broadcast a live show in 3D. It was filmed at Abbey Road, the site of the world's first satellite broadcast (by [[the Beatles]]). Keane fans were prompted to buy 3D glasses along with the new 7" single "Better Than This" or also to hand-make their own glasses.

On 10 May 2010, Keane released the EP titled ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' which, on 16 May became their fourth number 1 album in the UK. ''Night Train'' was recorded during the Perfect Symmetry World Tour. The band first named this record as a mini-album, then that changed to an EP. In an interview, Tim Rice-Oxley said that ''Night Train'' is "pretty much an album". The songs "Stop for a Minute" and "Looking Back" feature Somali Canadian rapper [[K'naan]]. The EP includes a cover of the song "You've Got to Help Yourself" by [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], featuring vocals by Japanese funk MC [[Tigarah]]. The song "Your Love" features Keane's keyboardist Tim Rice-Oxley on lead vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zaphod.uk.vvhp.net/consumer/viewemailcontent.pl?con=8270644&cmp=4625&act=117035&sec=b83a2124df37 |title=KWN |website=Zaphod.uk.vvhp.net |date=10 May 2010 |access-date=4 July 2011}}</ref> The song "My Shadow" was featured in the Season 6 ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' episode "Shiny Happy People".

Supporting the ''Night Train'' EP, the band began on the Night Train Tour, which started with a show in Brixton, London at [[The Fridge (nightclub)|The Fridge]] on 12 May 2010. The tour includes a homecoming show at the Bedgebury Pinetum, outside the band's hometown of Battle.

[[File:Show Keane em São Paulo, Brasil, novembro de 2024 (12).jpg|thumb|right|Keane performing in [[Brazil]], 2024]] 

Toward the end of 2018, Keane posted a series of cryptic images onto their various social media accounts, hinting that the quartet were in the studio working on material. On 17 January 2019, an article from ''The Sun'' revealed that the band are planning "to make a comeback after six years away" and that a "source close to the rockers has revealed the band is ready to work together again after 'putting their differences to one side'". On 6 February, Keane posted an image of them on their various social media accounts. This was followed by several announcements on their Instagram and Facebook sites of various festivals in which the band would perform, including Cornbury Music Festival (6 July 2019), 4ever Valencia Fest in Spain (21 July 2019), MEO Marés Vivas in Portugal (19 July 2019), Noches del Botánico in Madrid (20 July 2019), and Hello Festival in The Netherlands (9 June). On 15 March 2019, Keane performed their song "[[Somewhere Only We Know]]" on [[Comic Relief|Comic Relief's Red Nose Day]] on BBC One with London Contemporary Voices.

On 8 August 2019, the second single, "Love Too Much", was released for streaming and debuted on ''The Breakfast Show'' on BBC Radio 2. Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, writing "Not a game-changing comeback by any means, ''Cause and Effect'' is instead a satisfying return to form that manages to gracefully age Keane by invigorating a familiar formula with wisdom and honesty learned over a dramatic, life-changing decade."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/cause-and-effect-mw0003289655 |title=cause and effect review |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=15 July 2020}}</ref> On 9 April 2021, Keane announced on their social media platforms they would be participating in [[Record Store Day]] 2021 Drop&nbsp;2 on 17&nbsp;July, with the special early release of their ''Dirt'' EP on 12" vinyl, featuring four previously unreleased tracks from the ''Cause and Effect'' sessions.

==Collaborations==
In November 2004, Keane collaborated with electronic DJ Faultline on a cover of the [[Elton John]] song "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road". Two years later, Rice-Oxley collaborated with [[Gwen Stefani]] as a co-writer of the song "[[Early Winter]]", released later in 2007 as a single, from her album ''[[The Sweet Escape]]''. Stefani had been wishing to work with the band since 2005, and Rice-Oxley responded by saying "we might give it a go".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keane.at/articles/154.html |title=Gwen Stefani eyes up Keane |access-date=28 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011170122/http://keane.at/articles/154.html |archive-date=11 October 2007 }}</ref> Tom Chaplin collaborated with Rocco Deluca and the Burden on the song "Mercy". The band collaborated with Somali-Canadian rapper [[K'naan]] and Japanese [[Funk carioca|Baile Funk]] singer Tigarah on the EP ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]''. In late 2009, Rice-Oxley collaborated with the Australian singer [[Kylie Minogue]] as co-writer of the song "Everything Is Beautiful", for Minogue's eleventh studio album "[[Aphrodite (Kylie Minogue album)|Aphrodite]]", released in June 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/7854430/Kylie-Minogue-Aphrodite-CD-review.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/7854430/Kylie-Minogue-Aphrodite-CD-review.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Kylie Minogue: Aphrodite, CD review | first=Neil | last=McCormick | date=25 June 2010}}{{cbignore}}</ref>
The band collaborated with dance artist [[Chicane (recording artist)|Chicane]] on a remix of the song "Bend & Break", renamed "Wake Up". It was featured on the artist's 2008 best-of compilation. In 2012, Tom Chaplin collaborated with the Dutch singer Laura Jansen on the song "Same Heart" for a Dutch charity radio programme. The track was featured on Jansen's second studio album ''Elba''. In 2017, a version of Tom Chaplin's solo track "Solid Gold", featuring alternative pop singer JONES, was released as a single.

==Musical style and themes==
Tim Rice-Oxley and Dominic Scott were the main writers of the band's songs during their early years. When Scott left in 2001, Rice-Oxley became the main composer.<ref name="Songs">{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/faq/#writes|title=FAQ – Who writes the songs?|work=Keaneshaped.com| access-date =4 August 2006}}</ref> However, Rice-Oxley credits the rest of the band on all compositions, so that royalties for song credits are shared.<ref name="Songs" />

Keane usually harbours an ample, reverberated, melodic, slow- to mid-tempo fully orchestrated sound, somehow reminiscent of [[Elton John]]'s early and middle career, and their more introspective songs have brought comparisons to [[Suede (band)|Suede]] and [[Jeff Buckley]].

While guitars have been (minimally) present even in their early work, their appearance in the final mix has always been slight, and while Chaplin has stepped up as an almost full-time guitarist in the band, that instrument is never featured as prominently as to be more than barely noticed. For this matter, they have been dubbed as "the band with no guitars", thanks to their heavily piano-based sound. By using [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] and [[distortion]] effects on their pianos and similar keyboards, they often create sounds that aren't immediately recognisable as piano. Rice-Oxley said during an interview in Los Angeles that they tend to think piano-related music is boring and what they really wanted to do was try something different.

Rice-Oxley said "I guess it's classic song writing that is the main influence rather than one band in particular – we love people like [[Nick Drake]] who can convey so much emotion and write songs and albums that will be loved and cherished for many years – the things that will be in people's record collections for their whole lives."<ref name="keaneshaped.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.keaneshaped.co.uk/faq/#influences |title=FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions|website=Keaneshaped.co.uk |access-date=4 July 2011}}</ref>
