Best known as a member of the rock band the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], his five-decade career includes solo work and stints in other bands: the [[James Gang]], [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]], and New Zealand's [[Herbs (band)|Herbs]]. He was part of the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Best (band)|The Best]] and had success as a solo artist and prolific [[session musician]], appearing on other artists' recordings. In 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him No. 54 on its list of "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".<ref name="100 greatest">{{citation|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/joe-walsh-20111122|title=100 Greatest Guitarists: Joe Walsh|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=January 15, 2013|archive-date=March 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308012249/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/joe-walsh-20111122|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the mid-1960s, after attending [[Kent State University]], Walsh played with several local Ohio bands before reaching national fame with the [[James Gang]], whose hit "[[Funk 49]]" showcased his skills. Roger Abramson signed the James Gang to BPI in Cleveland. After leaving the James Gang in 1972, Walsh formed [[Barnstorm (band)|Barnstorm]] with [[Joe Vitale (musician)|Joe Vitale]] and [[Kenny Passarelli]]. Though the band produced three albums, their work was marketed as Walsh solo projects. The last Barnstorm album, ''[[So What (Joe Walsh album)|So What]]'' (1974), featured significant contributions from Eagles members.

At producer [[Bill Szymczyk]]'s suggestion, Walsh joined the Eagles in 1975 as guitarist and keyboardist, replacing founding member [[Bernie Leadon]]. His first album with them was ''[[Hotel California (album)|Hotel California]]''.<ref name="FelderHolden 2008">Felder, Don; [[Wendy Holden (author, born 1961)|Holden, Wendy]] (2008).

Walsh has released 12 solo studio albums, six [[compilation album]]s, and two live albums. His solo hits include "[[Rocky Mountain Way]]", "[[Life's Been Good]]", "[[All Night Long (Joe Walsh song)|All Night Long]]", "[[A Life of Illusion]]", and "[[Ordinary Average Guy]]".

==Early life and education==
Walsh was born on November 20, 1947, in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. His father, Lt. Robert Newton Fidler, was a pilot in the [[United States Air Force]], who died in a mid-air collision while flying a [[Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star]] during maneuvers over [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] on July 22, 1949.<ref name="auto"/> Walsh's mother, Helen, was a classically trained pianist of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and German ancestry.

Walsh was adopted by his stepfather at the age of five and given his stepfather's surname, but retained Fidler as his middle name. In the 1950s, it was common practice for children to take the name of their stepfather for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], school registration, and health records.<ref>{{cite interview |title=Joe Walsh| url= http://www.joewalshonline.com/downloads/multimediafunstuffaudio.htm |interviewer= [[Steve Dahl]] |type= Interview: audio|work=Morning Show| year=2008}}</ref> Walsh and his family lived in [[Columbus, Ohio]], for a number of years during his youth. When he was twelve, his family moved to New York City. Later, Walsh moved to [[Montclair, New Jersey]], and attended [[Montclair High School (New Jersey)|Montclair High School]], where he played oboe in the school band. Walsh played tight end briefly for the high school team before being injured. In his late teens he would often take the bus to Manhattan and stand outside the Bitter End club and listen to [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], being too young to be allowed in. Similarly, he would stand outside the [[Peppermint Lounge]] in order to hear [[Joey Dee and the Starliters]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://njmonthly.com/articles/jersey-living/before-the-fast-lane/ | title=Before the Fast Lane | date=June 11, 2012 }}</ref>

Walsh acquired his first guitar at the age of 10, and upon learning [[the Ventures]]' "[[Walk, Don't Run (instrumental)|Walk Don't Run]]", decided that he wanted to pursue a career as a guitarist.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matera |first1=Joe |title=Joe Walsh: 'You Have to Play in Front of People; Even if You Suck at It at First, You Have to Do It' |url= https://www.guitarworld.com/gw-archive/joe-walsh-you-have-go-out-and-play-front-people-even-if-you-suck-it-first-you-have-do-it |website= Guitar World |access-date=April 4, 2019 |language=en |date=November 20, 2015}}</ref> Inspired by the success of [[the Beatles]], he replaced Bruce Hoffman as the bass player in the locally popular group the Nomads in [[Madison, New Jersey]], beginning his career as a rock musician.

After high school, Walsh briefly attended [[Kent State University]], where he spent time in various bands playing around the [[Cleveland]], Ohio, area, including the Measles. The Measles recorded for [[Super K Productions]]' [[Ohio Express]] the songs "I Find I Think of You", "And It's True", and "Maybe" (an instrumental version of "And It's True").  He planned to major in English and minor in music. Walsh has also stated he was present during the [[Kent State massacre]] in 1970. Walsh commented in 2012: "Being at the shootings really affected me profoundly. I decided that maybe I don't need a degree that bad."<ref name="SDUT" >{{cite news| last1= Varga|first1=George|title= Fact or fiction?

==Musical career==

===1965–1967: The Measles ===
Walsh and three other [[Kent State University]] students formed The Measles, a garage bar band, in 1965. Two tracks on Ohio Express's ''Beg Borrow and Steal'' album, "I Find I Think Of You" and "And It's True", were actually recorded by the Measles, led by Walsh who also provided the vocals. Additionally, an instrumental version of "And It's True" was recorded by the Measles, re-titled "Maybe" and released as the B-side of the "Beg Borrow and Steal" single.

===1968–1971: James Gang===
{{Main|James Gang}}

[[File:James Gang.png|thumb|Walsh (left) with the James Gang, 1970]]
Around Christmas 1967, James Gang guitarist [[Glenn Schwartz]], who turned out to be [[AWOL]] from the army and was breaking up with his wife, decided to leave the band to move to California, where he ended up forming the band [[Pacific Gas & Electric (band)|Pacific Gas & Electric]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

Walsh was accepted and the band continued as a five-piece for a short time until Phil Giallombardo, who was still in high school at the time, left. Bill Jeric and Walsh worked together on guitar parts, but Jeric left as well in the spring of 1968. He was replaced by a returning Ronnie Silverman, who had been discharged from the military.

In May 1968, the group played a concert in Detroit at the [[Grande Ballroom]], opening for [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. At the last minute, Silverman told the others that he would not join them at the show. The band, desperately in need of the money, took to the stage as a trio. They liked their sound as a threesome and decided to remain that way.

In 1968, the band signed with manager Mark Barger, who was handling the career of fellow Ohio outfit [[the Lemon Pipers]], who had just scored a big hit with "[[Green Tambourine]]." Barger put the Gang in touch with [[ABC Records]] staff producer [[Bill Szymczyk]], who signed them to ABC's new [[Bluesway Records]] subsidiary in January 1969.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

They released their debut album, ''[[Yer' Album]]'', in 1969. In November 1969, bassist Tom Kriss decided he was no longer into the music and left to be replaced by Dale Peters, who was brought in from a group called the Case of E.T. Hooley. The addition of Peters created the most successful incarnation of the James Gang. Walsh proved to be the band's star attraction, noted for his innovative rhythm playing and creative guitar riffs. In particular he was known for hot-wiring the pickups on his electric guitars to create his trademark "attack" sound.<ref>{{cite book | last= Charlesworth| first= Chris|title=A-Z of Rock Guitarists|year=1982|page=92}}</ref> The James Gang had several minor hits and became an early [[album-oriented rock]] staple for the next two years. It was during 1969 that Walsh sold his [[Les Paul]] guitar to [[Jimmy Page]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/forgotten-guitar-jimmy-page-offers-close-look-his-number-1-les-paul|title=Forgotten Guitar: Jimmy Page Offers an Up-Close Look at His "Number 1" Les Paul|first=Jonathan | last= Graham| website= Guitarworld.com |date=May 7, 2018|access-date=September 27, 2019}}</ref> Later in 1969, the group's record producer, Szymczyk, arranged for the band to appear in the "electric Western" film ''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'', with two James Gang songs, "Laguna Salada" and "Country Fever", also being used. For the recording of these two songs, vocalist Kenny Weiss was brought in to allow Walsh to focus on his guitar playing; he was gone by the time the group arrived in Mexico to shoot their movie scenes. "Laguna Salada" and "Country Fever" later reappeared as bonus tracks on the 2000 re-release of ''The James Gang Greatest Hits''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/the-james-gang-greatest-hits/id316854721 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201162915/https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/the-james-gang-greatest-hits/id316854721 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |title= The James Gang Greatest Hits by James Gang |publisher=iTunes Store |date=May 2, 2000 |access-date= April 18, 2014}}</ref>

Shortly before the release of their second album ''[[James Gang Rides Again]]'', they opened a show for [[the Who]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Their guitarist [[Pete Townshend]] met with James Gang before they left, impressed enough to invite them on [[the Who]]'s subsequent European tour. When Walsh was asked about it, he said, "Pete's a very melodic player and so am I. He told me that he appreciated my playing. I was flattered beyond belief because I didn't think I was that good."<ref name= "www.theuncool.com"/>

The James Gang's next two albums, ''James Gang Rides Again'' (1970) and ''[[Thirds (album)|Thirds]]'' (1971), produced such classics as "Funk 49" and "Walk Away". The album ''James Gang Live at Carnegie Hall'' was Walsh's last album with them, as he became dissatisfied with the band's limitations.

The two remaining members, Peters and Fox, carried on with lead vocalist [[Roy Kenner]] and guitarist [[Domenic Troiano]] (both ex-members of the Canadian band [[Bush (Canadian band)|Bush]]) for two albums, ''[[Straight Shooter (James Gang album)|Straight Shooter]]'' and ''[[Passin' Thru (James Gang album)|Passin' Thru]]'', both released in 1972. But in recent interviews, Fox stated that things did not work out musically with Troiano as hoped, so Troiano left the band in 1973 and later, in late 1974, joined [[the Guess Who]]. Guitarist [[Tommy Bolin]] was then brought into the band, after being recommended by Walsh.

===1971–1975: Barnstorm===
In December 1971, after Walsh left the James Gang, [[Steve Marriott]], frontman guitarist of [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]], invited Joe to move to England and join his band, which [[Peter Frampton]] had left, but Walsh declined.<ref name="www.theuncool.com"/> Instead he moved to Colorado and formed a band called [[Barnstorm (band)|Barnstorm]], with drummer and multi-instrumentalist [[Joe Vitale (musician)|Joe Vitale]], and bassist [[Kenny Passarelli]], although both of their albums credited Walsh as a solo artist. They started recording their debut album immediately after forming, but at the time there were only Walsh and Vitale on these sessions. [[Chuck Rainey]] did the first bass tracks on the album but these were soon replaced by Passarelli. Walsh and Barnstorm released their debut album, ''[[Barnstorm (album)|Barnstorm]]'', in October 1972. After taking a cue from Townshend, Walsh utilized the [[ARP Odyssey]] synthesizer to great effect on such songs as "Mother Says" and "Here We Go". Walsh also experimented with acoustic guitar, [[slide guitar]], [[effects pedals]], [[fuzzbox]], [[talk box]], and keyboards as well as running his guitar straight into a [[Leslie speaker]] 122 to get swirly, organ-like guitar tones. The album was a critical success, but had only moderate commercial success. The follow-up, ''[[The Smoker You Drink, the Player You Get]]'', released in June 1973, was marketed under Walsh's name (although officially a Barnstorm album) and was their commercial breakthrough. It peaked at No. 6 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart. The first and leading single, "[[Rocky Mountain Way (song)|Rocky Mountain Way]]", received heavy airplay and reached No. 23 on the US Top 40 chart.<ref>{{cite web |title= Song: Rocky Mountain Way by Joe Walsh|url=http://www.songplaces.com/Rocky_Mountain_Way/Caribou_Ranch_Nederland_Colorado |publisher=Songplaces.com |access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> It featured new member, keyboardist Rocke Grace, and Walsh shared the vocals and songwriting with the other three members of the band. As a result, a variety of styles are explored on this album. There are elements of blues, jazz, folk, pop, and Caribbean music. In 1974, Barnstorm disbanded and Walsh continued as a solo artist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cmhof.org/events/dan-fogelberg-joe-walsh-barnstorm-caribou-ranch|title=Dan Fogelberg, Joe Walsh & Barnstorm, Caribou Ranch|publisher=Colorado Music Hall of Fame|access-date=May 18, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518211730/http://cmhof.org/events/dan-fogelberg-joe-walsh-barnstorm-caribou-ranch|archive-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref>

In late 1974, Walsh played slide guitar on Vitale's debut solo album ''[[Roller Coaster Weekend]]''. Walsh was taught the slide technique by [[Duane Allman]], co-founder of the [[Allman Brothers Band]] with his brother [[Gregg Allman|Gregg]], who had done a standout turn on [[Eric Clapton]]'s 1970 [[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]] double-album as a drop-in contributor to [[Derek and the Dominos]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Scapelliti | first=Christopher | title=Joe Walsh Teaches the Duane Allman Slide Method As He Learned It from the Man Himself | website=Guitar World| date=2015-10-11 | url=https://www.guitarworld.com/lessons/joe-walsh-teaches-duane-allman-slide-method-he-learned-it-man-himself | access-date=2025-03-14}}</ref>

Barnstorm's last tour was in the spring of 1975, shortly after Walsh joined the Eagles.

[[File:Joe Walsh 4 - 1975.jpg|thumb|250px|Walsh playing slide guitar with a [[Gibson Les Paul Special]], 1975]]

===1975–1980: Eagles===
In 1975, Walsh was invited to join the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] as founding member [[Bernie Leadon]]'s replacement. There was some initial concern as to Walsh's ability to fit in with the band, as he was considered far too "wild" for the band's sound, especially by their drummer and co-lead vocalist, [[Don Henley]].<ref>{{citation |last1=Felder|first1=Don|last2=Holden|first2=Wendy|title=Heaven and Hell: My Life in The Eagles (1974–2001)|year=2009|page=153}}</ref>

Released on December 8, 1976, ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' was the band's fifth studio album and the first to feature Walsh. The album took a year and a half to complete, a process which, along with touring, drained the band.

The second single from the album was the title track, "[[Hotel California]]", which topped the charts in May 1977 and became one of the Eagles' signature songs next to "[[Take It Easy]]" and "[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]". It features Henley on lead vocals, with a guitar duet performed by Felder and Walsh.

The hard rock "[[Life in the Fast Lane]]", released on May 3, 1977, was based on a riff by Walsh. It reached No. 11 on the charts and helped establish Walsh's position in the band.

''Hotel California'' was the last album to feature founding member [[Randy Meisner]], who abruptly left the band after the 1977 tour. He was replaced by [[Timothy B. Schmit]], who had also succeeded him in [[Poco (band)|Poco]]:.<ref name = "FelderHolden 2008"/>{{rp|190}}

In 1977, the band, minus Don Felder, performed instrumental work and backing vocals for [[Randy Newman]]'s album ''[[Little Criminals]],'' including "[[Short People]]", which has backing vocals by Frey and Schmit.

The Eagles went into the recording studio in 1977 to begin work on their next album, ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]].'', which was not completed and released until September 24, 1979. Considered a disappointment by some music critics for failing to live up to ''Hotel California,'' it nonetheless proved a huge commercial hit; topping the charts and selling 7 million copies. Three singles from it —"[[Heartache Tonight]]", the [[The Long Run (song)|title track]] and "[[I Can't Tell You Why]]" - reached the Top 10, and "[[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|In the City]]" by Walsh also received considerable airplay. The band recorded two Christmas songs during these sessions, "Funky New Year"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iloveclassicrock.com/its-not-a-party-til-the-eagles-come-knocking-with-the-ultra-fun-funky-new-year/|title=It's Not A Party Til The Eagles Come Knocking With The Ultra Fun "Funky New Year"|website=Iloveclassicrock.com|date=December 29, 2017 |access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref> and "Please Come Home for Christmas", which was released as a single in 1978 and reached No. 18 on the charts. The band broke up in 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eagles-all-night-long-final-show-1980-split-1031861/|title=Flashback: The Eagles Play 'All Night Long' at Final Show Before 1980 Split|first=Andy|last=Greene|website=Rollingstone.com|date=July 21, 2020|access-date=July 22, 2021}}</ref>

===1973–2012: solo career===
[[File:JoeWalshSept06.jpg|thumb|left|Walsh performing live at [[Gulfstream Park]] in [[Hallandale Beach, Florida]], September 2006]]

Through 2012 Walsh has released eleven solo studio albums.

In December 1974, Walsh released his first album that was not considered a [[Barnstorm (band)|Barnstorm]] project, ''[[So What (Joe Walsh album)|So What]]'', which contained more introspective material such as "Help Me Through the Night" and "Song for Emma", a tribute to Walsh's daughter who had been killed in a car accident that April. On a few tracks, [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]] and [[Randy Meisner]] of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] contributed backing vocals.

In March 1976, Walsh released a live album, ''[[You Can't Argue with a Sick Mind]]'', which also featured the Eagles.

As the Eagles struggled to record their follow-up to ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'', Walsh re-ignited his solo career with the critically well-received album, ''[[But Seriously, Folks...]]'' in May 1978. It contained the single "[[Life's Been Good]]", his comedic depiction of rock stardom, which peaked at No. 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5785/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}} |title=Joe Walsh > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles |publisher=[[AllMusic]]  |access-date=January 29, 2010}}</ref> and remains to date his biggest solo hit. Walsh also contributed "[[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|In the City]]" to ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'' soundtrack in 1979, a song penned and sung by Walsh that was later rerecorded for the Eagles' studio album, ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |title=To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1998 |page=348}}</ref>

Following the breakup of the Eagles in July 1980, Walsh continued to release solo albums throughout the 1980s, but sales did not match his earlier success.<ref name=Gibson>{{citation |url=http://www.edroman.com/guitars/gibson/gibson%20guitar%20models/joe%20walsh.html|title=Gibson Joe Walsh Les Paul|publisher=Ed Roman Guitars|access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref>

''[[There Goes the Neighborhood (album)|There Goes the Neighborhood]]'' was Walsh's first album since the demise of the Eagles, peaking at No. 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200. It spawned a lone single, "[[A Life of Illusion]]", which topped the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart in 1981 and became one of Walsh's most popular songs.

"A Life of Illusion" was recorded in 1973 with Walsh's first solo band Barnstorm but was not completed. The overdubs and final mixes were completed during the ''There Goes the Neighborhood'' sessions and released on the album. The promotional video for the track shows the making of the album's cover. This song also appeared in the opening credits of ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' and appears as the first song on its soundtrack.

In May 1983, Walsh released ''[[You Bought It – You Name It]]''; the album was received negatively by the majority of music critics, though others found some good points. It was also not as successful as Walsh's previous albums, peaking at No. 48 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Walsh found moderate success with the single "[[Space Age Whiz Kids (song)|Space Age Whiz Kids]]", about the pinnacle of the 1980s video arcade craze. The album contains hard rock songs such as "I Can Play That Rock & Roll" and a cover of the [[Dick Haymes]] track, "[[Love Letters (song)|Love Letters]]". It also contains more introspective material such as "Class of '65", and contains a song titled "I.L.B.T.s", an acronym for "I Like Big Tits".

Walsh's new girlfriend, former [[Fleetwood Mac]] front singer [[Stevie Nicks]], was involved in his next album, ''[[The Confessor (album)|The Confessor]]''.

Walsh's final solo album to date, ''[[Analog Man (album)|Analog Man]]'', was released in June, 2012.  It was co-produced by [[Jeff Lynne]], with [[Tommy Lee James]] co-writing some of its tracks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/joe-walsh-to-release-analog-man-on-june-5/9972169 |title=Joe Walsh to release Analog Man on 5 June|newspaper=Artistdirect |publisher=Artist Direct|date=March 26, 2012 |access-date=May 1, 2014}}</ref>  The song "One Day at a Time" details his struggles with alcohol and drug abuse earlier in his career.

===Eagles reunions with Walsh===
[[File:Eagles (1).jpg|thumb|Walsh performing with the Eagles, 2008]]
An Eagles country tribute album titled ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]'' was released in 1993, thirteen years after the split. [[Travis Tritt]] insisted on having the ''Long Run''-era Eagles in his video for "Take It Easy" and they agreed. Following years of public speculation, the band formally reunited the following year. The lineup comprised the five ''Long Run''-era members—Frey, Henley, Walsh, Felder, and Schmit—supplemented by [[Scott F. Crago|Scott Crago]] (drums), John Corey (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), [[Timothy Drury]] (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), and Al Garth (saxophone, violin) on stage.

"For the record, we never broke up, we just took a 14-year vacation", announced Frey at their first live performance in April 1994. The ensuing tour spawned a live album titled ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]'' (named for Henley's recurring statement that the band would get back together "when hell freezes over"), which debuted at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. It included four new studio songs, with "[[Get Over It (Eagles song)|Get Over It]]" and "[[Love Will Keep Us Alive]]" both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved as successful as the tour, selling 6 million copies in the U.S. The tour was interrupted in September 1994 because of Frey's serious recurrence of [[diverticulitis]], but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm|title=The Great Gastro-Intestinal Saga of Glenn Frey (1994–95)|access-date=November 2, 2014|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011185039/http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm|archive-date=October 11, 2007}}.

Walsh's love of [[Santa Cruz Island]] grew into a lifelong commitment to conserve the environment there, and he has been active in preserving the island's parks. He is President of the Santa Cruz Island Foundation, and has served on the Foundation's board since the 1980s.

Walsh had often joked about running for office, announcing a mock presidential campaign in 1980 and a vice presidential campaign in 1992. Walsh ran for President of the United States in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], promising to make "[[Life's Been Good]]" the new national anthem if he won, and ran on a platform of "Free [[Gasoline|Gas]] For Everyone".<ref>{{citation|title=Joe Walsh: Featured Artist|url=http://www.lastfm.com.br/group/Classic+Rock/forum/14969/_/458069|publisher=last.fm|access-date=May 20, 2014|archive-date=June 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618172534/http://www.lastfm.com.br/group/Classic+Rock/forum/14969/_/458069|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though Walsh was only 32 at the time of the election and thus would not have met the 35-year-old requirement to actually assume office, he said that he wanted to raise public awareness of the election.<ref>{{citation|title=Artistfacts for Joe Walsh|url=http://www.songfacts.com/facts-joe_walsh.php|publisher=Songfacts|access-date=November 5, 2014}}</ref> In 1992 Walsh ran for vice president with Rev.

In an interview to promote his album ''[[Analog Man (album)|Analog Man]]'' in 2012, Walsh revealed he was considering a serious bid for political office. "I think I would run seriously, and I think I would run for Congress", Walsh told [[WASH (FM)|WASH]] in Washington, D.C. "The root of the problem is that Congress is so dysfunctional. We're dead in the water until Congress gets to work and passes some new legislation to change things."<ref name="Congress" />

In 2017, Walsh contacted others in the music industry, including the [[Zac Brown Band]], [[Gary Clark Jr.]], and [[Keith Urban]], to try to organize and perform what became VetsAid<ref>{{citation|title=Joe Walsh's VetsAid Concert|url=http://www.vetsaid.org|access-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref> – a concert series along the lines of [[Willie Nelson]]'s [[Farm Aid]].

Walsh married Marjorie Bach (sister of [[Barbara Bach]] and sister-in-law of [[Ringo Starr]])<ref name=Starr /> in Los Angeles on December 13, 2008.<ref>{{citation |title=Penny Laine's Anthology|author=Rowan, Terry|year=2012}}</ref> His sister-in-law [[Susan Walsh (missing person)|Susan Walsh]] has been a missing person since 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2006/07/16/96-stripper-vanish-clue/|title='96 STRIPPER VANISH CLUE|last=Hamilton|first=Brad|date=July 16, 2006|website=New York Post|language=en|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref>

Walsh's daughter [[Lucy Walsh]] is a musician who has worked with [[Ashlee Simpson]] and others. She released her debut solo album, ''Lost in the Lights'', in 2007.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lost-in-the-lights-mw0000750333|title=Lucy Walsh: Lost in the Lights|website=AllMusic|access-date=April 30, 2014}}</ref>

Her story inspired the track "Song for Emma" on Walsh's solo album ''[[So What (Joe Walsh album)|So What]]'' released later that year. In her memory, he had a fountain and memorial plaque placed in a park in which she played, North Boulder Park in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. He has said that the album name ''So What'' was a result of Emma's death, that nothing else seemed meaningful or important in the months that followed. The strain eventually contributed to Walsh's divorce from his second wife Stefany.<ref name="Joe Walsh Biography"/><ref>{{citation|author=Taylor, Carol|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/features/ci_16348612| title=Emma's fountain lives long after rock 'n' roll tragedy|date=October 24, 2010|work=Daily Camera|location=Boulder, Colorado|access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> While touring with singer [[Stevie Nicks]] in 1984, Walsh took Nicks to the park's fountain; this inspired Nicks to write "[[Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You?]]" on her 1985 album ''[[Rock A Little]]''.
