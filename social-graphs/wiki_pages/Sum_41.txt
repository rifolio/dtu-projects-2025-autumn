==History==

===1994–1998: Formative years===
Sum 41 has its origins in the band Kaspir, which was formed by [[Deryck Whibley]] and Grant McVittie in 1994, inspired by [[Weezer]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. As time went on, the band's drummer was replaced by [[Steve Jocz]] and the music became increasingly inspired by [[NOFX]], particularly their 1991 album ''[[Ribbed]]''. Seeing this change as too sonically dissimilar to their original sound, they decided to form a new band and to change their sound because they sounded "like the early nineties rock music we used to listen to, and don't anymore".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Whibley|first=Deryck|title=Walking Disaster|publisher=[[Gallery Books]]|year=2024|isbn=9781408719732|location=New York|language=en}}</ref><ref name="99.9 Radio">{{cite AV media|people=[[Steve Jocz]]|date=October 11, 2023|title=Steve Jocz Aka Stevo Of Sum 41 Interview On 99.9 Punk World Radio FM (1st Interview In 10 Years)|type=Radio interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih2e_XeoOQs|access-date=October 29, 2023|time=2m–7m|publisher=99.9 Punk World Radio FM}}</ref> The band chose the name "Sum 41" after looking at the calendar and counting how many days it had been from the start of their summer break to the day the [[Warped Tour 1996|Warped Tour]] was on and seeing that it was forty-one days.<ref name=":0" /> The band debuted its new name during [[Battle of the Bands|Supernova's Battle of the Bands]] on September 28, 1996.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Exclaim Gormely">{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Gormely|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/sum_41_survive_teen_stardom_substance_abuse_and_changing_tastes_to_rise_again_on_out_for_blood|title=Sum 41 Survive Teen Stardom, Substance Abuse and Changing Tastes to Rise Again on 'Out for Blood'|work=[[Exclaim!]]|date=July 12, 2019|access-date=December 14, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412015924/https://exclaim.ca/music/article/sum_41_survive_teen_stardom_substance_abuse_and_changing_tastes_to_rise_again_on_out_for_blood|archive-date=April 12, 2023|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Sam|last=Coare|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-rise-of-sum-41-as-told-through-their-most-important-gigs-deryck-whibley-interview-download-festival|title=The rise of Sum 41, as told through their most important gigs|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|date=June 5, 2024|access-date=October 19, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240605113349/https://www.kerrang.com/the-rise-of-sum-41-as-told-through-their-most-important-gigs-deryck-whibley-interview-download-festival|archive-date=June 5, 2024|url-status=live}}</ref> The first lineup to use this name included Whibley, Jocz, McVittie and Jon Marshall.<ref name="99.9 Radio" /> Another early member was bassist Richard Roy who shortly replaced McVittie.<ref name="auto"/>
