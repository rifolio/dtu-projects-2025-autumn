'''Depeche Mode'''{{efn|The band took its name from the French fashion magazine ''Dépêche Mode'', believing that it translated to "[[fast fashion]]". However, the name more accurately translates to "fashion news" as ''Dépêche'' means "news dispatch" and ''Mode'' means "fashion".<ref name="nametranslate">{{cite web|title= Depeche Mode – the real origin of the band's name |website= Eighty-eightynine |access-date= 17 February 2013 |url= http://www.eightyeightynine.com/music/depeche-mode.html}}</ref>}} ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˌ|p|ɛ|ʃ|_|ˈ|m|oʊ|d}})<ref>{{cite book|last1=Olausson|first1=Lena|last2=Sangster|first2=Catherine|year=2006|title=Oxford BBC Guide to Pronunciation|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=98|isbn=0-19-280710-2}}</ref> is an English [[electronic music|electronic]] band formed in [[Basildon]], [[Essex]] in 1980.<ref name="Bio"/> Originally formed with the line-up of [[Dave Gahan]], [[Martin Gore]], [[Andy Fletcher (musician)|Andy Fletcher]] and [[Vince Clarke]], the band currently consists of Gahan and Gore.

With Clarke as its primary songwriter, Depeche Mode released its debut album ''[[Speak & Spell (album)|Speak & Spell]]'' in 1981 amid the British [[New wave music|new wave]] scene. Clarke left the band at the end of 1981, going on to form the groups [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]] and later [[Erasure (duo)|Erasure]]. The remaining trio recorded its second album, ''[[A Broken Frame]]'' (1982), with Martin Gore as chief songwriter. The band then recruited [[Alan Wilder]], establishing a line-up that continued until 1995, beginning with the albums ''[[Construction Time Again]]'' (1983) and ''[[Some Great Reward]]'' (1984). The albums ''[[Black Celebration]]'' (1986) and ''[[Music for the Masses]]'' (1987) cemented Depeche Mode as a dominant force within the electronic and alternative music scenes, and its June 1988 concert at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Pasadena Rose Bowl]] drew a crowd of over 60,000 people.

In 1990, Depeche Mode released its seventh album, ''[[Violator (album)|Violator]]'', which reached number seven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified triple platinum by the [[RIAA]]. The following album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'' (1993) was also a success, though the band's internal struggles during recording and touring resulted in Wilder's departure in 1995. The band returned to the lineup of Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher, and released the album ''[[Ultra (Depeche Mode album)|Ultra]]'' in 1997. It continued touring and recorded five more albums as a trio—''[[Exciter (Depeche Mode album)|Exciter]]'' (2001), ''[[Playing the Angel]]'' (2005), ''[[Sounds of the Universe]]'' (2009), ''[[Delta Machine]]'' (2013) and ''[[Spirit (Depeche Mode album)|Spirit]]'' (2017)—until Fletcher's death in 2022. Gahan and Gore have since continued as a duo. Their latest album, ''[[Memento Mori (Depeche Mode album)|Memento Mori]]'', was released in 2023.

Depeche Mode has had 54 songs in the [[UK singles chart]], 17 Top 10 albums in the UK chart, and sold more than 100 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|title= Depeche Mode mit Weltpremiere beim ECHO |publisher= [[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] |date= 3 February 2009 |access-date= 18 August 2014 |url= http://www.musikindustrie.de/presse_aktuell_einzel/back/82/page/3/news/depeche-mode-mit-weltpremiere-beim-echo/ |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082648/http://www.musikindustrie.de/presse_aktuell_einzel/back/82/page/3/news/depeche-mode-mit-weltpremiere-beim-echo/ |archive-date= 19 August 2014 |language= de}}</ref><ref name="Mason">{{cite magazine|first= Kerri |last= Mason |title= Depeche Mode Prepares for Tour of the Universe |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 23 March 2009 |access-date= 5 November 2014 |url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269153/depeche-mode-prepares-for-tour-of-the-universe}}</ref> ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' included the band in its list of the "50 Bands That Changed the World!"<ref name="50Bands">{{cite magazine |title= Q – 50 Bands That Changed the World! |magazine= Q |via= Rocklist.net |issue= 214 |date= May 2004 |access-date= 31 March 2012 |url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage3.htm#50%20Bands%20That%20Changed%20The%20World |archive-date= 29 June 2012 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120629012641/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage3.htm%23The%20Music%20That%20Changed%20The%20World#50%20Bands%20That%20Changed%20The%20World |url-status= usurped }}</ref> Depeche Mode also rank No. 98 on [[VH1]]'s "100 Greatest Artists of All Time."<ref>{{cite web|first= Brandon |last= Stosuy |title= VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All Time |website= [[Stereogum]] |date= 13 April 2011 |access-date= 26 September 2015 |url= https://www.stereogum.com/495331/vh1-100-greatest-artists-of-all-time/franchises/list/attachment/depeche-mode/}}</ref> In 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named Depeche Mode the 10th Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1 |magazine= Billboard |access-date= 29 September 2017 |url= https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists}}</ref> Depeche Mode were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2020, including former members Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder. <ref name="Class">{{cite news|title= Class of 2020 |publisher= [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |url= https://www.rockhall.com/class-2020-inductees |access-date= 15 January 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Depeche-mode-martin-gore2.jpg|alt=Martin Gore in 1986|thumb|Martin Gore in 1986]]
Depeche Mode's origins date to 1977, when schoolmates Vince Clarke and Andy Fletcher formed a band called No Romance in China with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass.

Composition of Sound would become embarrassed about their band name and started thinking of changing it. There were several potential variants, including the name "Musical Moments" that was suggested by Vince Clarke as both a band name and the name of their first album. Starting at their concert on 24 September 1980 at Bridge House, the band changed their name to Depeche Mode, chosen by Dave Gahan.<ref>{{cite web|title= 1980-09-24 Bridge House, London, England, UK |access-date= 10 October 2022 |url= https://dmlive.wiki/wiki/1980-09-24_Bridge_House,_London,_England,_UK}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Desborough |first=Jenny |date=2021-03-26 |title=Depeche Mode name: What does Depeche Mode mean? |url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/1414172/Depeche-Mode-name-what-does-Depeche-Mode-mean-how-evg |access-date=2023-02-27 |website=Express.co.uk |language=en}}</ref> When explaining the choice for the new name, which was taken from a mistranslation of the name of French fashion magazine ''Dépêche Mode'',<ref>{{cite magazine |title= Excelsior Publications suspend Dépêche mode |magazine= Stratégies |date= 8 November 2001 |access-date= 1 May 2017 |url= http://www.strategies.fr/actualites/medias/r67272W/excelsior-suspend-la-parution-de-depeche-mode.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210205852/http://www.strategies.fr/actualites/medias/r67272W/excelsior-suspend-la-parution-de-depeche-mode.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 10 December 2008 |language= fr }}</ref> Gore said, "It means 'hurried fashion' or 'fashion dispatch'.

The band made their recording debut in late 1980 for the ''[[Some Bizzare Album]]'' (released in 1981) with the song "Photographic", later re-recorded for their debut album ''[[Speak & Spell (album)|Speak & Spell]]''.

The band made a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] but, instead of mailing the tape to record labels, they would go in and personally deliver it. They would demand the labels play it; according to Dave Gahan, "most of them would tell us to fuck off. They'd say 'leave the tape with us' and we'd say 'it's our only one'. Then we'd say goodbye and go somewhere else."<ref name="Giles">{{cite magazine|first= Jeff |last= Giles |title= This band wants your respect – Depeche Mode may sell millions of albums and play to capacity crowds in huge football stadiums but these techno-pop idols still aren't happy |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |via= TipTopWebsite.com |pages= 84–87 |date= 26 July 1990 |access-date= 5 November 2014 |url= http://www.tiptopwebsite.com/websites/index2.php?username=depechemodefile&page=20}}</ref>

According to Gahan, prior to securing their record contract, they were receiving offers from all the major labels. [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]] offered them "money you could never have imagined and all sorts of crazy things like clothes allowances".<ref name="Giles"/>

It reached number 57 in the UK charts. Encouraged by this, the band recorded their second single, "[[New Life (song)|New Life]]", which climbed to number 11 in the UK charts and got them an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The band went to London by train, carrying their synthesisers all the way to the [[BBC]] studios.

The band's next single was "[[Just Can't Get Enough (Depeche Mode song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]". The [[synth-pop]] single became the band's first UK top ten hit. The video is the only one to feature Vince Clarke. Depeche Mode's debut album, ''[[Speak & Spell (album)|Speak & Spell]]'', was released in October 1981 and peaked at number ten on the UK album charts.<ref name="OCC"/> Critical reviews were mixed; ''[[Melody Maker]]'' described it as a "great album … one they had to make to conquer fresh audiences and please the fans who just can't get enough",<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Paul |last= Colbert |title= Talking Hook Lines |date= 31 October 1981 |magazine= [[Melody Maker]] |url= http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/mel311081/mel311081main.htm |archive-date= 24 July 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724052535/http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/mel311081/mel311081main.htm}}</ref> while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was more critical, calling the album "[[Motion picture content rating system|PG]]-rated fluff".<ref>{{cite magazine |first= David |last= Fricke |author-link= David Fricke |title= Speak & Spell – Depeche Mode |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= 13 May 1982 |access-date= 4 May 2011 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/speak-spell-19820513 |archive-date= 13 October 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111013214138/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/speak-spell-19820513 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

Soon afterwards, Clarke joined up with blues singer [[Alison Moyet]] to form [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]] (or Yaz in the United States). Initial talk of Clarke's continuing to write material for Depeche Mode ultimately amounted to nothing. According to third-party sources, Clarke offered the remaining members of Depeche Mode the track "[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]", but they declined.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=107}} Clarke, however, denied in an interview that such an offer ever took place saying, "I don't know where that came from.

In late 1981, the band placed an anonymous ad in ''Melody Maker'' looking for another musician: "Name band, synthesise, must be under twenty-one."<ref name="D93"/> [[Alan Wilder]], a classically trained keyboardist from West London, responded and, after two auditions and despite being 22 years old, was hired in early 1982, initially on a trial basis as a touring member.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=121}} Wilder would later be called the "Musical Director" of the band, responsible for the band's sound until his departure in 1995.<ref name="P93"/> As producer [[Flood (music producer)|Flood]] would say, "[Alan] is sort of the craftsman, Martin's the idea man and [Dave] is the attitude."<ref name="P93"/>

In January 1982, the band released "[[See You (Depeche Mode song)|See You]]", their first single without Clarke, which managed to beat all three Clarke-penned singles in the UK charts, reaching number six.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=113}} The following tour saw the band playing their first shows in North America. Two more singles, "[[The Meaning of Love]]" and "[[Leave in Silence]]", were released ahead of the band's second studio album. Daniel Miller informed Wilder that he wasn't needed for the recording of the album, as the core trio wanted to prove they could succeed without Vince Clarke.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=134}} ''[[A Broken Frame]]'' was released that September, and the following month the band began their 1982 tour.

In their early years, Depeche Mode had really attained success only in Europe and Australia. This changed in March 1984, when they released the single "[[People Are People]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Richard |last= Buskin |title= Classic Tracks: Depeche Mode 'People Are People' |magazine= [[Sound on Sound]] |date= February 2007 |access-date= 6 July 2020 |url= https://www.soundonsound.com/people/classic-tracks-depeche-mode-people-are-people}}</ref> The song became a hit, reaching No. 2 in Ireland and Poland, No. 4 in the UK and Switzerland, and No. 1 in West Germany – the first time a DM single topped a country's singles chart – where it was used as the theme to West German TV's coverage of the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]].{{sfn|Malins|2001|p=82}} Beyond this European success, the song also reached No. 13 on the US charts in mid-1985, the first appearance of a DM single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was a Top 20 hit in Canada. "People Are People" became an anthem for the LGBT community,<ref>{{cite web|first= B. |last= Voss |title= Masters of 'The Universe' |magazine= [[David Atlanta]] |date= 6 May 2009 |access-date= 10 January 2012 |url= http://www.davidatlanta.com/2009/5-6/cover/coverstory/2686.cfm |archive-date= 9 June 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090609225243/http://www.davidatlanta.com/2009/5-6/cover/coverstory/2686.cfm}}</ref> regularly played at gay establishments and [[gay pride]] festivals in the late 1980s. [[Sire Records|Sire]], the band's North American record label, released a compilation of [[People Are People (album)|the same name]] which included tracks from ''A Broken Frame'' and ''Construction Time Again'' as well as several [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]].

On the American tour, the band was, according to Gore, "shocked by the way the fans were turning up in droves at the concerts".<ref name="Giles"/> He said that although the concerts were selling well, Depeche Mode struggled to sell records.<ref name="Giles"/>

In September 1984, ''[[Some Great Reward]]'' was released. ''Melody Maker'' claimed that the album made one "sit up and take notice of what is happening here, right under your nose."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Barry |last= McIlheney |title= Greatness and Perfection |magazine= Melody Maker |date= 29 September 1984 |url= http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/mel290984/mel290984main.htm |archive-date= 4 January 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090104140145/http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/mel290984/mel290984main.htm}}</ref> In contrast to the political and environmental subjects addressed on the previous album, the songs on ''Some Great Reward'' were mostly concerned with more personal themes such as sexual politics ("[[Master and Servant]]"), adulterous relationships ("Lie to Me"), and arbitrary divine justice ("[[Blasphemous Rumours / Somebody|Blasphemous Rumours]]"). Also included was the first Martin Gore ballad, "[[Blasphemous Rumours / Somebody|Somebody]]"—such songs would become a feature of all following albums.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} "Somebody" was released as a double A-side with "Blasphemous Rumours", and was the first single with Gore on lead vocal. ''Some Great Reward'' became the first Depeche Mode album to enter the US album charts, and made the Top 10 in several European countries.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

''[[The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg]]'' was the band's first video release, almost an entire concert from their 1984 Some Great Reward Tour.

In July 1985, the band played their first-ever concerts behind the [[Iron Curtain]], in [[Budapest]] and [[Warsaw]].{{sfn|Malins|2001|p=95}} In October 1985, Mute released a compilation, ''[[The Singles 81→85]]'' (''[[Catching Up with Depeche Mode]]'' in the US), which included the two new non-album hit singles "[[Shake the Disease]]" and "[[It's Called a Heart]]", with the US version also including their B-sides ("Fly on the Windscreen", the B-side of "It's Called a Heart", would also be included on the next studio album ''[[Black Celebration]]'').

In the United States, the band's music appealed primarily to an [[Alternative rock|alternative]] audience who were disenchanted with the predominance of "soft rock and 'disco hell'"<ref>{{cite web |title= Alan Wilder's history – Historical evidence Part 1 |website= Recoil.co.uk |access-date= 19 October 2010 |url= http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/afiles/hist/athree.htm |archive-date= 5 August 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210805183304/http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/afiles/hist/athree.htm |url-status= dead }}</ref> on the radio. This view of the band was in sharp contrast to how the band was perceived in Europe, despite the increasingly dark and serious tone in their songs.<ref>{{cite news|first= Francesco |last= Adinolfi |title= Dep Jam |newspaper= [[Record Mirror]] |date= 22 August 1987 |url= http://sacreddm.net/1980s/rmi220887/rmi220887main.htm |archive-date= 26 August 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110826141059/http://sacreddm.net/1980s/rmi220887/rmi220887main.htm}}</ref> In Germany, France, and other European countries, Depeche Mode were considered teen idols and regularly featured in European teen magazines, becoming one of the most famous synth-pop bands in the mid-'80s.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}
Depeche Mode's musical style shifted slightly again in 1986 with the release of their fifteenth single, "[[Stripped (song)|Stripped]]", and its accompanying album ''[[Black Celebration]]''. Retaining their often imaginative sampling and beginning to move away from the "industrial pop" sound that had characterised their previous two LPs, the band introduced an ominous, highly atmospheric and textured sound. Gore's lyrics also took on a darker tone and became more pessimistic.

The music video for "[[A Question of Time]]" was the first to be directed by [[Anton Corbijn]], beginning a working relationship that continues to the present. Corbijn has directed 22 of the band's videos. He has also filmed some of their live performances and designed stage sets, as well as most covers for albums and singles starting from ''Violator''.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

For 1987's ''[[Music for the Masses]]'', the band's sound and working methods continued to develop. It was the first time they worked with a producer not related to Mute Records. Dave Bascombe was called to assist with the recording sessions; although, according to Alan Wilder, Bascombe's role ended up being more that of engineer.<ref name="Shunt">{{cite web |title= Music for the Masses – Depeche Mode |website= Recoil.co.uk |access-date= 16 October 2010 |url= http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/report/edit/dm8698/mftm1.htm |archive-date= 11 August 2022 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20220811203305/http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/report/edit/dm8698/mftm1.htm |url-status= dead }}</ref> In making the album, the band largely eschewed [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] in favour of [[synthesiser]] experimentation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Music for the Masses – Depeche Mode |website= Recoil.co.uk |access-date= 16 October 2010 |url= http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/report/edit/dm8698/mftm2.htm |archive-date= 24 September 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210924165134/http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/report/edit/dm8698/mftm2.htm |url-status= dead }}</ref> While chart performance of the singles "[[Strangelove (song)|Strangelove]]", "[[Never Let Me Down Again]]" and "[[Behind the Wheel]]" proved to be disappointing in the UK, they performed well in countries such as Canada, Brazil, West Germany, South Africa, Sweden and Switzerland, often reaching the top 10.

{{See also|Violator (album)}}
In mid-1989, the band began recording in [[Milan]] with producer [[Flood (music producer)|Flood]] and engineer [[François Kevorkian]]. The initial result of this session was the single "[[Personal Jesus]]". Prior to its release, a marketing campaign was launched with advertisements placed in the [[Personal advertisement|personals columns]] of UK regional newspapers with the words "Your own personal Jesus." Later, the ads included a phone number one could dial to hear the song. The resulting furore helped propel the single to number 13 on the UK charts, becoming one of their biggest sellers to date. In the United States, it was their first gold single and their first Top 40 hit since "People Are People", eventually becoming the biggest-selling 12-inch single in [[Warner Records]]' history up to that point.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=291}}

Released in February 1990, "[[Enjoy the Silence]]" reached number six in the UK (the first Top 10 hit in that country since "Master And Servant"). A few months later it reached number eight in the US and earned the band a second gold record, and it won Best British Single at the 1991 [[Brit Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |title= The BRITs 1991 |website= Brits.co.uk |access-date= 14 October 2010 |url= http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1991 |archive-date= 13 January 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120113123508/http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1991 |url-status= dead }}</ref> To promote their new album, ''[[Violator (album)|Violator]]'', the band held an in-store autograph signing at Wherehouse Entertainment in Los Angeles.

The members of Depeche Mode regrouped in [[Madrid]] in February 1992.

In 1993, ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'', again with [[Flood (music producer)|Flood]] producing, saw them experimenting with arrangements based as much on heavily distorted electric guitars and live drums (played by Alan Wilder, whose debut as a studio drummer had come on the ''Violator'' track "Clean") as on synthesisers.<ref>{{cite web |title= Songs of Faith and Devotion – Depeche Mode |website= Recoil.co.uk |access-date= 14 May 2016 |url= http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/report/edit/dm8698/epilog1.htm |archive-date= 11 August 2022 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20220811204525/http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/report/edit/dm8698/epilog1.htm |url-status= dead }}</ref> Live [[String instrument|strings]], [[uilleann pipes]] and female [[Gospel music|gospel]] vocals were other new additions to the band's sound.

However, Gahan would rarely turn up to scheduled sessions, and when he did, it would take weeks to get any vocals recorded; one six-week session at [[Electric Lady Studios|Electric Lady]] in New York produced just one usable vocal (for "Sister of Night"), and even that was pieced together from multiple takes.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=413}} Gore was forced to contemplate breaking the band up and considered releasing the songs he had written as a solo album.<ref>{{cite news|first= Mark |last= Brown |title= Depeche vs. Drugs |newspaper= [[Winnipeg Free Press]] |date= 1 May 1997 |access-date= 5 November 2014 |url= http://www.tuug.org/~jaakko/dm/dmtekstit/drugs.txt |url-status= dead |archive-date= 26 January 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170126080710/http://www.tuug.org/~jaakko/dm/dmtekstit/drugs.txt}}</ref> In mid-1996, after his near-fatal overdose in which his heart stopped beating for two minutes,<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 July 2011 |title=Sacred DM – NME 18 01 97 |url=http://www.sacreddm.net/1990s/nme180197/nme180197main.htm |access-date=13 October 2022 |archive-date=24 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724052835/http://www.sacreddm.net/1990s/nme180197/nme180197main.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Gahan entered a court-ordered [[drug rehabilitation]] program to battle his addiction to cocaine and heroin.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Keith |last= Cameron |title= Dead Man Talking |date= 18 January 1997 |magazine= NME |url= http://www.sacreddm.net/1990s/nme180197/nme180197main.htm |archive-date= 24 July 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724052835/http://www.sacreddm.net/1990s/nme180197/nme180197main.htm}}</ref> With Gahan out of rehab in 1996, Depeche Mode held recording sessions with producer [[Tim Simenon]].

The album debuted at No. 1 in the UK as well as Germany, and No. 5 in the US. The band did not tour in support of the album, with Fletcher quoted as saying: "We're not fit enough.

In 2001, Depeche Mode released ''[[Exciter (Depeche Mode album)|Exciter]]'', produced by [[Mark Bell (British musician)|Mark Bell]] (of [[techno]] group [[LFO (British band)|LFO]]).

"[[Dream On (Depeche Mode song)|Dream On]]", "[[I Feel Loved]]", "[[Freelove]]" and "[[Goodnight Lovers]]" were released as singles in 2001 and 2002. Critical response to the album was mixed, with reasonably positive reviews from some magazines (''[[NME]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[LA Weekly]]''), while others (including ''Q'' magazine, ''[[PopMatters]]'' and ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'') derided it as sounding underproduced, dull and lacking in luster.<ref>{{cite web|title= Exciter – Depeche Mode |website= [[Metacritic]] |access-date= 10 February 2007 |url= https://www.metacritic.com/music/exciter/depeche-mode}}</ref>

In October 2005, the band released their 11th studio album ''[[Playing the Angel]]''. Produced by [[Ben Hillier]], the album peaked at No. 1 in 18 countries and featured the hit single "[[Precious (Depeche Mode song)|Precious]]". This is the first Depeche Mode album to feature lyrics written by Gahan and, consequently, the first album since 1984's ''[[Some Great Reward]]'' featuring songs not written by Gore. "[[Suffer Well]]" was the first ever post-Clarke Depeche Mode single not to be written by Gore (lyrics by Gahan, music by Philpott/Eigner). The final single from the album was "[[John the Revelator / Lilian|John the Revelator]]", an up-tempo electronic track with a running religious theme, accompanied by "Lilian", a lush track that was a hit in many clubs all over the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

To promote ''Playing the Angel'', the band launched [[Touring the Angel]], a concert tour of Europe and North America that began in November 2005 and ran for nine months. During the last two legs of the tour Depeche Mode headlined a number of festivals including the [[Coachella|Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] and the [[Wireless Festival|O<sub>2</sub> Wireless Festival]]. In total, the band played to more than 2.8 million people across 31 countries and the tour was one of the highest grossing and critically acclaimed tours of 2005/2006.<ref name="Mason"/> Speaking about the tour, Gahan praised it as "probably the most enjoyable, rewarding live shows we've ever done.

He went on to say, "That was a very important step in the history of electronic music, they were way before The Prodigy and the whole industrial scene."

==Philanthropy==
Early in their career, Depeche Mode was dismissive of benefit concerts such as [[Live Aid]]. Gore himself stated, "If these bands really care so much, they should just donate the money and let that be it. Why can't they do it without all the surrounding hype?".{{sfn|Malins|2001|p=95}}

Since 2010, the band has applied their celebrity and cultural longevity to help promote and raise funds for several notable charity endeavours. They lent their support to high-profile charities such as [[MusiCares]], [[Cancer Research UK]] and the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]]. The band has also supported the Small Steps Project, a humanitarian organization based in the UK, aiming to assist economically disadvantaged children into education.<ref>{{cite web|title= Depeche Mode: Charity Work, Events and Causes |website= Look to the Stars |access-date= 25 March 2017 |url= https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/depeche-mode}}</ref> They have partnered with Swiss watchmaker [[Hublot]] to support [[Charity: Water]], aimed at the provision of clean drinking water in developing countries.<ref>{{cite web|first= Joelle |last= Diderich |title= Hublot and Depeche Mode Link Up to Benefit Charity: Water |website= WWD |date= 30 January 2014 |access-date= 25 March 2017 |url= http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/hublot-and-depeche-mode-link-up-to-benefit-charity-water-7402778/}}</ref> Such collaboration led to the release of two different limited edition watches, the Hublot Big Bang Depeche Mode in 2017 and The Singles Limited Edition series based from the Big Bang model in 2018.
