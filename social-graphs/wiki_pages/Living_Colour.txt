==History==
===Early years (1984–1986)===
British-born guitarist [[Vernon Reid]] had formed several bands in the years before forming Living Colour in New York in 1984, using the [[British spelling]] of "colour".<ref>{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Joseph |title=Cult of Personality: An interview with Will Calhoun (Living Colour) |url=https://willnotfade.com/2017/04/30/will-calhoun-living-colour-interview/ |website=Will Not Fade |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616211504/https://willnotfade.com/2017/04/30/will-calhoun-living-colour-interview/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |date=April 30, 2017 |quote=Band founder Vernon Reid is English, so made a deliberate choice to spell 'colour' correctly with the 'U' included. But most Americans spell many words incorrectly out of ignorance. It's not much of an issue.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Burgess |first1=Mick |title=We chat to Corey Glover from Living Colour ahead of Newcastle Riverside gig |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/corey-glover-living-colour-interview-13670041 |work=[[ChronicleLive]] |date=September 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109073550/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/corey-glover-living-colour-interview-13670041 |archive-date=November 9, 2017}}</ref> Reid assembled several bands under the name Vernon Reid's Living Colour from 1984 to 1986.<ref name="rs">{{cite magazine|title=Living Colour's Time Is Now|author=David Fricke|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/living-colours-time-is-now-19901101|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 1, 1990|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912232142/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/living-colours-time-is-now-19901101|archive-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref>  Reid was well known on the downtown New York jazz scenes because of his tenure in [[Ronald Shannon Jackson]]'s Decoding Society.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fricke |first1=David |title=Back in Black |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/back-in-black-2-95063/ |publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine |access-date=20 May 2021 |date=24 Sep 1987}}</ref>

Early band members included bassists Alex Mosely, [[Jerome Harris]] and Carl James, drummers Greg Carter, [[Pheeroan akLaff]] and J. T. Lewis, keyboardist [[Geri Allen]], and vocalists D. K. Dyson and [[Mark Ledford]], with Reid occasionally singing lead vocals himself. The band's sound was vastly different from the songs later in their significant label recordings. Material from this period included instrumental jazz/funk workouts, politically pointed [[punk rock]] burners, experimental excursions via Reid's guitar synth, and an early version of the song "[[Funny Vibe]]", which was reworked for their debut album ''[[Vivid (Living Colour album)|Vivid]]''.

===Mainstream success (1986–1991)===
[[File:Living-colour-live1993.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Living Colour in 1993]]
In 1986 a stable lineup was formed, consisting of vocalist/actor [[Corey Glover]], guitarist [[Vernon Reid]], bassist [[Muzz Skillings]], and drummer [[Will Calhoun]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> After hiring managers Jim Grant and Roger Cramer, the band hired prodigy [[lighting designer]] Andy Elias in November 1986 to strengthen their live shows with explosive visual productions.<ref>Panebianco, Julie. "Living Colour Rock The Ritz." ''East Village Eye,'' December 1986, p 6.</ref> The band became experienced at touring and performed regular gigs at the club [[CBGB]]. Around this time, their career also benefited from [[Rolling Stones]] singer [[Mick Jagger|Mick Jagger's]] involvement. Jagger's interest in Living Colour was piqued when Vernon Reid auditioned for the album ''[[Primitive Cool]]''; Jagger then arranged to see them live at CBGBs. Jagger went on to produce two of their demos. His endorsement encouraged major record labels to renew their interest in Living Colour, resulting in a recording contract with Epic Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/24/living-colours-vernon-reid-on-the-bands-formation-mick-jagger-and-reaching-audiences-through-grand-theft-auto|title = Living Colour's Vernon Reid on the band's formation, Mick Jagger, and reaching audiences through "Grand Theft Auto"|website=Denverpost.com| date=October 24, 2013 }}</ref> Interviewed in 2018, Vernon Reid looked back on the deal as a bittersweet triumph; "We had to get the co-sign from a person who literally embodied what rock 'n' roll is, the fact that he had to come see us, and dig us, for us to get at the back of the line is crazy."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2018/5/3/17312688/living-colour-cult-of-personality-vivid-30-years-anniversary|title = How Living Colour Reignited Rock's "Cult of Personality"|website=Theringer.com|date = May 3, 2018}}</ref>

''[[Vivid (Living Colour album)|Vivid]]'', released on May 3, 1988, gathered sales momentum when, later that year, [[MTV]] began playing the [[music video|video]] for "[[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]]". The album reached No. 6 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. On April 1, 1989, the band performed on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Four months later, the band gained further exposure as an opening act, along with [[Guns N' Roses]], for [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]].

In 1990, the band's second album, ''[[Time's Up (Living Colour album)|Time's Up]]'', featured songs in a variety of musical contexts; [[jazz fusion]], punk rock, [[Delta blues]], hip hop (cameos by [[Queen Latifah]] and [[Doug E. Fresh]]), funk, thrash metal, [[Jive (genre)|jive]], and hints of [[electronica]] were all represented.<ref>{{cite web |title= Living Colour Time's Up |author= Greg Prato |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/times-up-mw0000315449 |work= [[AllMusic]] |access-date= August 21, 2015 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150806185836/http://www.allmusic.com/album/times-up-mw0000315449 |archive-date= August 6, 2015 }}</ref> The album reached No. 13 on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> and won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Hard Rock Performance.

In 1991, Living Colour joined the inaugural [[Lollapalooza]] tour, and released an EP of outtakes entitled ''[[Biscuits (EP)|Biscuits]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===Second lineup and breakup (1992–1995)===
In 1992, Skillings left the band and was replaced by [[Doug Wimbish]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> This new lineup released their third album, ''[[Stain (album)|Stain]]'', in March 1993. The album reached No. 26 in the U.S., a further drop since its debut.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Despite retaining their strong fan base, Living Colour disbanded in January 1995 after failing to settle on common musical goals during their fourth studio album sessions.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Four of these tracks were included on the compilation ''[[Pride (Living Colour album)|Pride]]''. Following the breakup, individual band members released a variety of solo efforts.

===Reunion and subsequent events (2000–present)===
Living Colour re-formed on December 21, 2000, at [[CBGB]] as a gig billed "Head>>Fake w/ special guests". Head>>Fake was the current [[drum and bass]] project headed by Calhoun and Wimbish. Glover was on the bill to sing a few songs, and Reid came on after three songs. The reunion was followed by the release of the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Collideøscope]]'', in 2003, their first album not to chart in the United States, although it was critically praised.<ref>{{cite web |title=Review: Living Colour Collideoscope|author= Davey Boy |url= https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/29750/Living-Colour-Collideoscope/|work= Sputnikmusic |date=March 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Living Colour Collideoscope|author=Dave Mount|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/living-colour/collideoscope/13482/|work=Prefixmag|date=March 6, 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124749/http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/living-colour/collideoscope/13482/|archive-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref> In 2005, Sony Records released ''[[Live from CBGB's]]'', a live album recorded on December 19, 1989, as well as another [[compilation album|best-of compilation]], ''[[Everything Is Possible: The Very Best of Living Colour]]'', with songs from ''Vivid'' to ''Collideøscope''. On September 22, 2006, Skillings joined the band for the first time in fourteen years when they played at a private party that drummer [[Jack DeJohnette]] threw for his wife, Lydia. Wimbish could not come back from his base in London to play for the event, so Skillings agreed to take over for the special private event.

In early 2009, [[WWE]] used "Cult of Personality" in the video promoting the induction of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] into its Hall of Fame. Outside of his use of it in professional wrestling.

In 2011, [[WWE]] wrestler [[CM Punk]] returned with [[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]] as his theme song for his highly anticipated Summer of Punk run. Punk had used this song before when he used to perform for [[Ring of Honor]]. Upon joining WWE, he did not try to get the song as his theme because he believed that WWE will not get a song licensed for a mid-card wrestler. He used the song for his [[All Elite Wrestling|AEW]] run as well between 2021 and 2023. CM Punk also entered to the song for his debut [[mixed martial arts]] bout at [[UFC 203]] and subsequently at [[UFC 225]] for his fight versus Mike Jackson.
