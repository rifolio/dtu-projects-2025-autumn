'''Sly and the Family Stone''' was an American band formed in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], in 1966 and active until 1983. Their work, which blended elements of [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[R&B]], became a pivotal influence on subsequent [[American popular music]]. Their core line-up was led by singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist [[Sly Stone]], and included Stone's siblings [[Freddie Stone]] (guitar, vocals) and [[Rose Stone]] (keyboard, vocals) alongside [[Cynthia Robinson]] (trumpet, vocals), [[Greg Errico]] (drums), [[Jerry Martini]] (saxophone), and [[Larry Graham]] (bass, vocals). The band was the first major American rock group to have a [[Racial integration|racially integrated]], mixed-gender lineup.<ref name="auto"/>

Formed in 1966, the group synthesized a variety of musical genres to pioneer the emerging "[[psychedelic soul]]" sound.<ref name="AllMusic - Psychedelic Soul">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/psychedelic-soul-ma0000005025|title=Psychedelic Soul Music Genre Overview|website=AllMusic}}</ref><ref name="rollingstone.com">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/fresh-245247/|title=Fresh|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 25, 1999}}</ref> They released a series of Top 10 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hits such as "[[Dance to the Music (song)|Dance to the Music]]" (1968), "[[Everyday People]]" (1968), “[[Hot Fun in the Summertime]]” (1969), and "[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]" (1969), as well as critically acclaimed albums such as ''[[Stand!]]'' (1969), which combined pop sensibility with social commentary.<ref name="Allmusic">{{AllMusic |class=album |tab=review |id=r18262 |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |access-date=January 18, 2005 |ref=Allmusic}}</ref> In the 1970s, it transitioned into a darker and less commercial funk sound on releases such as ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]'' (1971) and ''[[Fresh (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Fresh]]'' (1973), proving as influential as their early work.<ref name="auto"/> By 1975, drug problems and interpersonal clashes led to dissolution,<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. xi–xix.</ref> though Sly continued to record and tour with a new rotating lineup under the name "Sly and the Family Stone" until drug problems forced his effective retirement in 1987.<ref name="ErlewineSly" />

The work of Sly and the Family Stone influenced the sound of subsequent American funk, pop, soul, [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[hip hop music]]. Music critic [[Joel Selvin]] wrote, "there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone".<ref name=Selvin>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. xi.</ref> In 2010, they were ranked 43rd in [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time]],<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446/|title=100 Greatest Artists|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 3, 2010}}</ref> and three of their albums are included on the most recent version of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993.

== Career ==
Sylvester Stewart was born into the [[Dallas]], Texas, family of K.C. and Alpha Stewart, followers of the [[Church of God in Christ]] (COGIC), who encouraged musical expression in the household.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 1–4.</ref> After the Stewarts moved to [[Vallejo, California]], the youngest four children ([[Sly Stone|Sylvester]], [[Freddie Stone|Freddie]], [[Rose Stone|Rose]], and [[Vet Stone|Vaetta]]) formed "The Stewart Four", who released a local [[gramophone record|78 RPM single]], "On the Battlefield of the Lord" [[b-side|b/w]] "Walking in Jesus' Name".

While attending high school, Sylvester and Freddie joined student bands. One of Sylvester's high school musical groups was a [[doo-wop]] act called [[the Viscaynes]]. The Viscaynes released a few local [[single (music)|singles]], and Sylvester recorded several solo singles under the name "Danny Stewart".

By 1964, Sylvester had become Sly Stone. He became a disc jockey for [[San Mateo, California]]-located R&B radio station KSOL, where he included white performers such as [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] in his playlists. During the same period, he worked as a record producer for [[Autumn Records]], producing for San Francisco-area bands such as [[the Beau Brummels]] and [[the Mojo Men]]. One of the Sylvester Stewart-produced Autumn singles, [[Bobby Freeman]]'s "[[C'mon and Swim]]", was a national hit.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 12.</ref> Stewart recorded unsuccessful solo singles while at Autumn.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 8–9.</ref>

=== Early years ===
In 1966, Sly Stone formed a band called Sly & the Stoners, which included acquaintance Cynthia Robinson on trumpet. Around the same time, Freddie founded a band called Freddie & the Stone Souls, which included Greg Errico on drums, and Ronnie Crawford on saxophone. At the suggestion of Stone's friend, saxophonist Jerry Martini, Sly and Freddie combined their bands, creating Sly and the Family Stone in November 1966. At first the group was called Sly Brothers and Sisters but after their first gig at the Winchester Cathedral, a night club in [[Redwood City, California]], they changed the name to Sly & the Family Stone. Since both Sly and Freddie were guitarists, Sly appointed Freddie the official guitarist for the Family Stone, and taught himself to play the electronic organ. Sly also recruited Larry Graham, Robinson's cousin, to play bass guitar.

Vaetta Stewart wanted to join the band as well. She and her friends, [[Mary McCreary]] and [[Elva Mouton]], had a [[gospel music|gospel]] group called ''the Heavenly Tones''. Sly recruited the teenagers directly out of high school to become [[Little Sister (band)|Little Sister]], Sly and the Family Stone's background vocalists.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 88; interview with Elva "Tiny" Moulton.</ref>

After a gig at the Winchester Cathedral, [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] executive David Kapralik signed the group to CBS's [[Epic Records]] label. The Family Stone's first album, ''[[A Whole New Thing (Sly and the Family Stone album)|A Whole New Thing]]'', was released in 1967 to critical acclaim, particularly from musicians such as [[Mose Allison]] and [[Tony Bennett]].<ref name="WholeNew">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 59–60; interviews with David Kapralik and Jerry Martini.</ref> However, the album's low sales restricted their playing venues to small clubs, and caused [[Clive Davis]] and the record label to intervene.<ref name="WholeNew" /><ref name="Fotenot">Fotenot, Robert.

=== ''Stand!'' (1969) ===
[[File:Woodstock redmond stage.JPG|thumb|The Woodstock Music and Art Festival, at which Sly and the Family Stone performed on August 17, 1969.]]
In late 1968, Sly and the Family Stone released the single "[[Everyday People]]", which became their first No.&nbsp;1 hit.<ref name="BillboardCharts" /> "Everyday People" was a protest against prejudice of all kinds<ref>Greenwald, Matthew. [{{AllMusic|class=song|id=t294662|pure_url=yes}} Review of "Everyday People" by Sly and the Family Stone]. Allmusic.com. Retrieved on February 3, 2007.</ref> and popularized the [[catchphrase]] "different strokes for different folks".<ref>Lewis, Miles (2006), p. 57.</ref> With its [[B-side]] "[[Sing a Simple Song]]", it served as the lead single for the band's fourth album, ''[[Stand!]]'', which was released on May 3, 1969. The ''Stand!'' album eventually sold more than three million copies; its title track peaked at No.&nbsp;22 in the U.S. ''Stand!'' is considered one of the artistic high points of the band's career.<ref name="StandReview" /> It contained the above three tracks as well as the songs "[[I Want to Take You Higher]]" (which was the B-side of the "Stand!" single), "Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey", "Sex Machine", and "[[You Can Make It If You Try]]".<ref name="StandReview" />

The band headlined the [[Harlem Cultural Festival]] before tens of thousands of spectators in [[Marcus Garvey Park|Mount Morris Park]] in 1969. The concert series is the subject of a 2021 documentary film directed by Ahmir "[[Questlove]]" Thompson called ''[[Summer of Soul]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greenpleasantland.com|title=This Green and Pleasant Land|author=Bryan Greene|publisher=Poverty and Race Research Action Council|date=June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hal Tulchin, Who Documented a 'Black Woodstock,' Dies at 90|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 14, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/arts/television/hal-tulchin-90-dies-documented-a-little-seen-black-woodstock.html|access-date=January 23, 2018|last1=Sandomir |first1=Richard }}</ref>
The success of ''Stand!'' secured Sly and the Family Stone a performance slot at the landmark [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock Music and Art Festival]]. They performed their set during the early-morning hours of August 17, 1969; their performance was said to be one of the best shows of the festival.<ref name="Fotenot"/> A new non-album single, "[[Hot Fun in the Summertime]]", was released the same month and went to No. 2 on the U.S. pop chart (peaking in October, after the summer of 1969 had already ended).<ref name="BillboardCharts" /> In 1970, following the release of the [[Woodstock (film)|''Woodstock'' documentary]], the single of "Stand!" and "I Want to Take You Higher" was reissued with the latter song now the A-side; it reached the Top 40.<ref name="BillboardCharts" />

=== Internal problems and a change of direction ===
With the band's new-found fame and success came numerous problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 107, 146–152.</ref> Epic requested more marketable output.<ref>Lewis, Miles (2006), pp. 24–25.</ref> The [[Black Panther Party]] demanded that Sly replace Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists and fire manager [[David Kapralik]].<ref>Lewis, Miles (2006), p. 85.</ref><ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 89; interview with David Kapralik.</ref>

After moving to the Los Angeles area in fall 1969, Sly Stone and his fellow band members became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily cocaine and [[phencyclidine|PCP]].<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 94–98.</ref> As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Sly Stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went),<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 122.</ref> recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, "[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]"/"[[Everybody Is a Star]]", released in December 1969. "Thank You" reached the top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in February 1970.<ref name="BillboardCharts" />

During 1970, Sly Stone spent most of his waking hours on drugs.<ref name="SlyAddiction">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 113–115.</ref> He became erratic and moody, and missed nearly a third of the band's concerts that year.<ref name=MTVNews>{{cite news| last=Aswad| first=Jem| date=February 10, 2006 | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524032/20060209/story.jhtml | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070216034534/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524032/20060209/story.jhtml | url-status= dead | archive-date= February 16, 2007 | title= Who, Exactly, Is Sly Stone?

Brown, as his personal managers; they in turn brought in gangsters such as Edward "Eddie Chin" Elliott and [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafioso]] J.R. Valtrano to be Sly's bodyguards. Sly enlisted these individuals to handle his business dealings, to retrieve drugs, and to protect him from those he considered his enemies, some of whom were his own bandmates and staff.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 99–100, 150–152.</ref> A rift developed between Sly and the rest of the band;<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 146–147.</ref> in early 1971, drummer Errico became the first to leave the band for other ventures. He was replaced with a succession of drummers until Sly settled on Gerry Gibson, who only remained with the band for a year before being replaced by [[Andy Newmark]] in 1973.

To appease fan demand for new songs, Epic began re-releasing material. ''A Whole New Thing'' was reissued with a new cover, and several of the Family Stone's most popular recordings were packaged into the band's first ''[[Greatest Hits (Sly and the Family Stone)|Greatest Hits]]'' album. ''Greatest Hits'' reached number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in 1970.

During this period, Sly Stone negotiated a production deal with [[Atlantic Records]], resulting in his own imprint, [[Stone Flower Productions]]. Stone Flower released four singles, including one by R&B artist Joe Hicks, one by a group called 6IX, and two pop Top 40/R&B Top 10 singles by Little Sister: "You're the One" and "[[Somebody's Watching You]]", a cover of a song from ''Stand!''. For unclear reasons, Sly gradually withdrew his attention from Stone Flower, and the label was closed in 1971. Little Sister's "Somebody's Watching You" is the first popular recording to feature the use of a [[drum machine]] for its rhythm track.<ref>Lewis, Miles (2006), p. 74.</ref>

=== ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' (1971) ===
In 1971, Sly and the Family Stone returned with a new single, "[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]", which became a number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. "Family Affair" was the lead single from the band's long-awaited ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]''.

Instead of the optimistic, rock-laced soul that had characterized the Family Stone's 1960s output, ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' was urban [[blues]], filled with dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals representing the hopelessness Sly and many other people were feeling in the early 1970s.<ref>Lewis, Miles (2006), pp. 74–75.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Marcus |first=Greil |author-link=Greil Marcus |title=Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock'n'Roll Music |edition=4 |year=1997 |orig-year=1975 |publisher=Plume |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27836-8 |page=72 }}</ref> The album is characterized by a significant amount of tape hiss – the result of Sly's extensive re-recording and [[overdubbing]] during production.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 115–117.</ref> Allegedly, most of the album's instrumentation is performed by Sly alone, who enlisted the Family Stone for some of the additional instrumental parts and friends such as [[Billy Preston]], [[Ike Turner]], and [[Bobby Womack]] for others.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 115; interview with Stephen Paley.</ref> "(You Caught Me) Smilin'" and "[[Runnin' Away (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Runnin' Away]]" were also released as singles, and performed well on the charts.

After the release of ''Riot'', additional lineup changes took place. In early 1972, reacting to Jerry Martini's probing about his share of the band's earnings, Sly hired saxophonist [[Pat Rizzo]] as a potential replacement<ref name="Rizzo">Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 134.</ref> though both ended up remaining in the band.<ref name="Rizzo" /> Later that year, the tension between Sly Stone and Larry Graham reached its peak. A post-concert brawl broke out between the Graham and Sly entourages; Bubba Banks and Eddie Chin, having heard that Larry had hired a [[contract killing|hit man]] to kill Sly, assaulted Graham's associates.<ref name="LarrysExit">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 150–154.</ref> Graham and his wife climbed out of a hotel window to escape, and Pat Rizzo gave them a ride to safety.<ref name="LarrysExit" /> Unable to continue working with Sly, Graham immediately quit the Family Stone and went on to start [[Graham Central Station]], a successful band in the same vein as Sly and the Family Stone.<ref name="LarryBass" /> Graham was replaced in the interim by Bobby Womack, and then by nineteen-year-old [[Rustee Allen]].<ref name="LarrysExit" />

=== ''Fresh'' (1973) and ''Small Talk'' (1974) ===
Despite the loss of the original rhythm section and Sly's escalating cocaine use, the band's next album, ''[[Fresh (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Fresh]]'', was released in 1973. By this time, Sly's sound had become more stripped down, yet more [[syncopation|syncopated]] and rhythmically complex.<ref name="ErlewineFresh">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

=== Dissolution ===
[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2003.jpg|thumb|upright|The band's 1975 performance at Radio City Music Hall (shown 2003) was only one-eighth filled]]
During the 1970s, Sly or another of the band members would often miss a gig, refuse to play, or pass out from drug use, impacting their live bookings.<ref name="EndofFamily">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 141–145.</ref> At many gigs, concert-goers rioted if the band failed to appear or if Sly walked out before finishing his set.

Rose Stone was pulled out of the band by Bubba Banks, who was then her husband. She began a solo career, recording a Motown-style album under the name Rose Banks in 1976. Freddie Stone joined Larry Graham's group, [[Graham Central Station]], for a time; after collaborating with his brother one last time in 1979 for ''[[Back on the Right Track]]'', he retired from the music industry and eventually became the pastor of the Evangelist Temple Fellowship Center in Vallejo. Little Sister was also dissolved; Mary McCreary married [[Leon Russell]] and worked with him on music projects.<ref>Ankeny, Jason.

=== Sly Stone's later career ===
{{main|Sly Stone}}
Sly recorded two more albums for Epic: ''[[High on You (Sly Stone album)|High on You]]'' (1975) and ''[[Heard You Missed Me, Well I'm Back]]'' (1976). ''High on You'' was billed as a Sly Stone solo album; ''Heard You Missed Me'' was a Sly and the Family Stone album in name only. Although Sly continued to collaborate with some of the original Family Stone members on occasion, the actual band no longer existed. Sly played most of the instruments on the record himself; he maintained a band to support him for live shows. Among his main collaborators were Cynthia Robinson and Pat Rizzo from the Family Stone, and background vocalists [[Lynn Mabry]] and [[Dawn Silva]], who parted with Sly in 1977 and formed [[The Brides of Funkenstein]] in 1978. Epic released Stone from his contract in 1977, and in 1979 released ''10 Years Too Soon'', a [[remix]] album featuring [[disco]] versions of the 1960s Family Stone hits.

Sly signed with [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] and recorded ''[[Back on the Right Track]]'' (1979). Although the album featured contributions from Freddie and Rose Stone, Sly remained unable to return to the success of his late '60s and early '70s fame.<ref name="ErlewineSly" /> He toured with [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and Funkadelic during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and also appeared on the 1981 Funkadelic album ''[[The Electric Spanking of War Babies]]''. That year, Clinton and Sly began work on a new Sly Stone album; however, recording halted when Clinton and Funkadelic disputed with and left Warner Bros. Records in late 1981.<ref name="AintBut">Birchmeier, Jason. [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r50298|pure_url=yes}} Review of ''Ain't But the One Way'' by Sly and the Family Stone]. All Music Guide. Retrieved on February 4, 2007.</ref> When Sly disappeared into seclusion, producer [[Stewart Levine]] completed the album, which was released as ''[[Ain't But the One Way]]'' in 1982. The album sold poorly and received mixed critical reception, but Sly made an appearance on ''[[Late Night With David Letterman]]'' that year.<ref name="AintBut" /> Overcome by drug addictions, Sly Stone toured the United States with various backup acts. In June 1983 in Ft. Myers, Florida, he was arrested on drug possession and entered court-ordered drug rehabilitation. Once released, Sly continued sporadically releasing new singles and collaborations until a 1987 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and use. Afterwards, he stopped releasing music.

In 1992, Sly and the Family Stone appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s dance compilation album, ''[[Red Hot + Dance]]'', contributing an original track, "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) (Todds CD Mix)". The album attempted to raise awareness and money in support of the AIDS epidemic, and all proceeds were donated to AIDS charities.

In 2009, the documentary [[Coming Back for More (film)|''Coming Back for More'']] was released. Sly tells director [[:nl:Willem Alkema|Willem Alkema]] about his conflicts with his manager [[Jerry Goldstein (producer)|Jerry Goldstein]] and that because of this he is forced to live in hotels.

==Musical style and legacy ==

===Early years===
Sly Stone produced for and performed with black and white musicians during his early career, and he integrated music by white artists into black radio station KSOL's playlist as a DJ. Similarly, the Sly and the Family Stone sound was a [[melting pot]] of many influences and cultures, including [[James Brown]] funk, [[Motown Records|Motown]] pop, [[Stax Records|Stax]] soul, Broadway showtunes, and [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] [[rock and roll|rock music]].<ref name="ErlewineSly">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas .

The lyrics for the band's songs were often pleas for peace, love, and understanding among people. These calls against prejudice and [[self-hate]] were underscored by the band's on-stage appearance. White musicians Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini were members of the band at a time when integrated performance bands were virtually unknown; [[racial integration|integration]] had only recently become enforced by law. Female members Cynthia Robinson and Rosie Stone played instruments onstage, rather than just providing vocals or serving as visual accompaniment for the male members.<ref>{{cite book |last=Vincent |first=Rickey |title=Funk: The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One |year=1996 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-13499-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/funkmusicpeopler00vinc/page/91 91–92] |url=https://archive.org/details/funkmusicpeopler00vinc/page/91 }}</ref> The band's gospel-styled singing endeared them to black audiences; their rock music elements and wild costuming—including Sly's large [[Afro]] and tight leather outfits, Rose's blond wig, and the other members' loud psychedelic clothing—caught the attention of mainstream audiences,{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2009}}<ref name="Kaliss">{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2009}} Kaliss, Jeff.

===Later work===
The later work of Sly and the Family Stone was as influential as the band's early work. ''There's a Riot Goin' On'', ''Fresh'', and ''Small Talk'' are considered among the first and best examples of the matured version of funk music, after prototypical instances of the sound in the band's 1960s work.<ref name="ErlewineSly" /><ref>Rosen, Dave.

Retrieved on January 18, 2007</ref> A 2003 article for ''Rolling Stone'' commented; "Sly and the Family Stone created a musical utopia: an interracial group of men and women who blended funk, rock and positive vibes... Sly Stone ultimately discovered that his utopia had a ghetto, and he brilliantly tore the whole thing down on ''There's a Riot Goin' On'', which does not refute the joy of his earlier music."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/|title=Music News|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> In a retrospective review, Zeth Lundy of [[PopMatters]] called ''There's a Riot Goin' On'' "a challenging listen, at times rambling, incoherent, dissonant, and just plain uncomfortable" with "some episodic moments of pop greatness to be found" and viewed it as a radical departure from the band's previous work:

{{blockquote|[It] sank their previously burgeoning idealism at a time when social disillusionment was all the rage. Sly had found something else to take him higher and, as a result, ''Riot'' is a record very much informed by drugs, paranoia, and a sort of halfhearted malcontent [...] listening to it isn't exactly a pleasurable experience. It's significant in the annals of pop and soul because it is blunt and unflinching, because it reflects personal and cultural crises in a manner unbecoming for pop records at the time. ''Riot'' can be classified as avant-soul only after being recognized as a soul nightmare—the 'nightmare', so to speak, being a reflection of an unfortunate and uncompromised reality, not a glossed-over pop-music approximation of reality.<ref name="Lundy">Lundy, Zeth (April 2, 2007).

Sly and the Family Stone were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993. The original members of the Family Stone were in attendance, except Sly.

A Sly and the Family Stone tribute took place at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006|2006 Grammy Awards]] on February 8, 2006. The original plan was to surprise the audiences by featuring a reunion performance of the original lineup as a highlight, but the organisers were concerned that Sly Stone would not appear after he was late or absent for rehearsals.<ref name="AP2006">{{cite news| last=Coyle| first=Jake| date=February 8, 2006| url=http://movies.msn.com/music/article.aspx?news=215255| title=Reclusive Sly Stone Steps Out at Grammys| publisher=MSN.com| access-date=February 1, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101031308/http://movies.msn.com/music/article.aspx?news=215255| archive-date=November 1, 2007| url-status=dead}}</ref>

The tribute began halfway through the Grammy Awards ceremony, and was introduced by comedian [[Dave Chappelle]].

After the first half of "I Want to Take You Higher", the Family Stone took the stage alongside the other musicians, and Tyler called backstage "Hey, Sly; let's do it the way we used to do it!" Sporting a blonde [[mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] hairdo, sunglasses, and a silver [[lamé (fabric)|lamé]] suit, Sly Stone emerged and contributed vocals and keyboards to a continuation of "I Want To Take You Higher." Three minutes into the performance, Sly tossed a wave to the audience and exited the stage, leaving the Family Stone and the guest performers to complete the number alone.<ref name="AP2006" />

Sly's unusual appearance and brief performance garnered highly mixed reviews and was covered throughout the press. One [[Associated Press]] report referred to Sly as the "[[J. D.
