From the late 1990s Air Supply toured Asia and select US venues into the new millennium. They released further [[adult contemporary]] albums, ''[[The Book of Love (album)|The Book of Love]]'' (1997), ''[[Yours Truly (Air Supply album)|Yours Truly]]'' (2001), and ''[[Across the Concrete Sky]]'' (2003).<ref name="McF"/> In 2005 they issued live albums both on CD and DVD. They performed in [[Havana]], Cuba, becoming one of the first foreign bands invited to perform in the country. They were scheduled to perform two concerts, and played the first show on 7 July, the day before [[Hurricane Dennis]] hit the island. In high winds, that concert had an audience of 175,000. Due to the hurricane, the second show was cancelled. Fans staying at their hotel on 8 July had Russell performing acoustically for them, as there was no electricity. Songs were used in feature films, ''[[Bad Company (2002 film)|Bad Company]]'' (2002), ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'' and ''[[The Wedding Date]]'' (both 2005).{{citation needed|date=March 2025}}

In 2006 they issued an acoustic album, ''The Singer and the Song''. To support it they made their first trip to India in May 2006. On 2 December 2006, the duo performed to a capacity crowd in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. This was their second visit, after performing at the Air Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival in January. In 2007 Russell released his first adult contemporary solo album, ''The Future''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Graham Russell - The Future |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/15933242-Graham-Russell-The-Future |language=en |access-date=25 May 2022}}</ref> He also made an appearance in the film ''[[Believe (2007 film)|Believe]]'' (2007), a comedy about [[multi-level marketing]]. In 2008 based on their chart performances, they were ranked the 83rd best musical act of all time in ''Billboard'' Hot 100's 50th anniversary edition.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Jesse White |title='Air Supply' Concerts at Fortune Bay Slated |url=https://www.mesabitribune.com/news/air-supply-concerts-at-fortune-bay-slated/article_f5e227c8-8065-11e1-9266-0019bb2963f4.html |access-date=25 May 2022 |website=Mesabi Tribune |date=6 April 2012 }}</ref>

In May 2010, Air Supply released ''[[Mumbo Jumbo (album)|Mumbo Jumbo]]'', the duo's first studio album in eight years. It was recorded at Russell's home studio near Park City, Utah and at Odds on Records' state of the art facilities in Las Vegas with session musicians and an orchestra. It was produced by Russell and engineered by Sean O'Dwyer (Pink Floyd, Randy Newman and Blink-182). The first single "[[Dance with Me (Air Supply song)|Dance with Me]]" reached number&nbsp;28 on the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart and "Faith in Love", which peaked at number&nbsp;30. The music video for "[[All Out of Love]]" is seen briefly in the 2010 Australian film, ''[[Animal Kingdom (film)|Animal Kingdom]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 June 2014 |title=Animal Kingdom: rewatching classic Australian films |url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/jun/13/animal-kingdom-rewatching-classic-australian-films |access-date=25 May 2022 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>

In 2014, the group were approached by the [[Wideboys]] to [[remix]] their single "Desert Sea Sky".

On 2 December 2014, Evolution Music Group released Air Supply's first high-definition concert film, ''Air Supply - Live in Hong Kong'' on their evosound label. The album was released on blu-ray, DVD, CD and LP formats. The concert was recorded on 11 August 2013 at Asia World-Expo, Hong Kong.
