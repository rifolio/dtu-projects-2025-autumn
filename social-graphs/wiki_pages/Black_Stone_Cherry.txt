== History ==

=== 2001–2004: Formation and early years ===
Black Stone Cherry originated in [[Edmonton, Kentucky]]. Chris Robertson and John Fred Young, son of [[The Kentucky Headhunters]]' rhythm guitarist Richard Young, started to play music together early in their teens and were soon joined by Wells and Lawhon. Black Stone Cherry officially formed on June 4, 2001. They then took over the practice house which had been used by The Kentucky Headhunters since 1968 and began to record tracks. They also began holding shows at clubs in the area, and after a short while they gained a large following of people of all ages in the town. In 2003, on Black Stone Cherry Records, the band released their first demo on CD called ''Rock N' Roll Tape''.

=== 2005–2007: ''Black Stone Cherry'' ===
The band's debut [[Black Stone Cherry (album)|self-titled album]] was released in May 2006. After the band finished recording, they returned to Edmonton, invited by their former school principal, for a homecoming gig in the gym of the local middle school, which was attended by 1500 people. As the band entered the town, the streets were filled with people holding "welcome home" signs.

In July 2007, they released a second recording, an EP which contained the song "Rain Wizard" along with two previously unreleased tracks.

Their first live album was released on October 31, 2007. It was recorded at the [[London Astoria|Astoria]] in London, and copies were sold to the crowd immediately after the concert. The album is a strictly limited edition, and as of January 2013 mint copies were selling for £200 on [[Amazon.co.uk|Amazon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/B000YCO68G/sr=/qid=/ref=olp_tab_all?ie=UTF8&colid=&coliid=&me=&qid=&seller=&sr= |title=Buying Choices: London Astoria- 31St October 2007 |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |access-date=May 9, 2014}}</ref>
