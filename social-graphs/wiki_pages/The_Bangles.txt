'''The Bangles''' are an American [[all-female band|all-female]] [[pop rock]] band formed in Los Angeles, in 1981. They are known for hit singles during the 1980s that made them one of the most successful pop rock groups of the decade. The band’s biggest commercial successes include "[[Walk Like an Egyptian]]" (1986), which became a worldwide phenomenon, "[[Manic Monday]]" (1986), a song written by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and a cover of [[Simon & Garfunkel|Simon & Garfunkel’s]] "[[A Hazy Shade of Winter#The Bangles version|Hazy Shade of Winter]]" (1987), which was featured in the film ''Less Than Zero''.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-bangles|title=The Bangles Chart History|magazine=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bangles |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/22369/bangles/ |website=OfficialCharts.com |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref> Their ballad "[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]" (1989) became a big hit, topping the charts in several countries and is one of their signature songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bangles-mn0000757085/biography|title=Bangles &#124; Biography & History|website=AllMusic}}</ref> Other hits included "[[In Your Room (The Bangles song)|In Your Room]]" (1988) and "[[If She Knew What She Wants]]" (1986).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.albumism.com/features/the-bangles-debut-album-all-over-the-place-turns-35-anniversary-retrospective|title=The Bangles' Debut Album 'All Over the Place' Turns 35 &#124; Anniversary Retrospective|website=Albumism|date=May 21, 2019 }}</ref>

Formed by [[Susanna Hoffs]] and sisters [[Vicki Peterson]] and [[Debbi Peterson]], the group began as part of the [[Paisley Underground]] scene, a Los Angeles music movement heavily influenced by 1960s rock and psychedelic music. Their early work blended jangly guitar melodies with power-pop sensibilities. The original lineup included Hoffs (guitar and vocals), Vicki Peterson (guitar and vocals), Debbi Peterson (drums and vocals), and [[Annette Zilinskas]] (bass). After Zilinskas left in 1983 to focus on other projects, [[Michael Steele (musician)|Michael Steele]], formerly of [[the Runaways]], joined as bassist and vocalist, cementing the classic lineup.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bangles-mn0000757085/biography |title=Bangles &#124; Biography & History |website=AllMusic}}</ref>

Their 1984 debut album, ''[[All Over the Place (The Bangles album)|All Over the Place]]'', received critical acclaim and earned the group a loyal following, setting the stage for their commercial breakthrough with the 1986 album ''[[Different Light]]''. The success of ''Different Light'' established the Bangles as one of the top female-fronted acts of the 1980s. 

After their third album, ''[[Everything (The Bangles album)|Everything]]'' (1988), and the success of "Eternal Flame", the band struggled with internal tensions, and disbanded in 1989. However, they reunited in the late 1990s, recording new material and performing live.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Larsen |first1=Peter |title=Susanna Hoffs talks about the Bangles playing Arroyo Seco Weekend and that band's random connection to headliner Robert Plant |url=https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/2018/06/16/susanna-hoffs-talks-about-the-bangles-playing-arroyo-seco-weekend-and-that-bands-random-connection-to-headliner-robert-plant/ |access-date=July 21, 2018 |publisher=Pasadena Star News |date=June 16, 2018}}</ref> In 2018, founding bassist Annette Zilinskas rejoined the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-bangles|title=The Bangles Chart History|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and early years (1981–1983)===
[[File:The Bangles - Los Angeles Times (1982).jpg|thumb|The Bangles in 1982]]
Susanna Hoffs and sisters Vicki and Debbi Peterson had each been in bands before coming together in Los Angeles, California, in December 1980. The impetus was two classified advertisements in the weekly paper ''The Recycler''. One had been placed by Hoffs, and the only person to respond was Annette Zilinskas, and the other was by Lynn Elkind, the Petersons' housemate and a departing member of their then band Those Girls. When Hoffs called in response to Elkind's ad, Vicki Peterson answered the phone, and in their conversation, they discovered a great deal of common interests.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sobczak |first=Gene |date=November 1984 |title=Bangles |pages=12 |work=Hard Times |url=https://archive.org/details/HardTimesNumber4MaywoodNj/page/n11/mode/1up |access-date=May 11, 2014}}</ref>

When Hoffs spoke to Elkind after Peterson gave her the message, Hoffs and Elkind did not have the same common interests and Hoffs then formed a new band with the Petersons. The Those Girls bass guitarist, Vicki Peterson's lifelong best friend Amanda Hills, had also left the band (now a history professor, Amanda Hills Podany has performed as a guest with the Bangles on a few rare occasions)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jan-02-tm-bangles01-story.html|title=Rock Like a Historian|date=January 2, 2005|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re-GfMvJmLY |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/Re-GfMvJmLY| archive-date=December 11, 2021 |url-status=live|title=The Bangles – He's Got a Secret – Whisky December 8, 2016|date=December 9, 2016 |publisher=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockintheoc.com/2018/07/02/the-bangles-at-arroyo-seco-weekend/|title=The Bangles at Arroyo Seco Weekend|website=Rockintheoc.com|date=July 2, 2018 }}</ref> and this left an opening for Zilinskas. When Annette Zilinskas responded to the ad in ''The Recycler'', Hoffs told Zilinskas that the band was looking for a bass player and asked if she would be interested. Zilinskas accepted and the lineup was set.  The resulting (and also current as of 2018) lineup first performed as the Colours in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@rachel_macari/theres-more-than-meets-the-eye-to-the-bangles-9bfdb968ec2e|title=There's More Than Meets The Eye to The Bangles and You Should Know Why|first=Rachel|last=Macari|date=August 13, 2019|website=Medium.com}}</ref>

Shortly afterward, the group renamed themselves '''the Bangs'''. The band was part of the Los Angeles [[Paisley Underground]] scene, which featured groups that played a mixture of 1960s-influenced rock.<ref name="story">{{cite web | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19990220144013/http://www.seds.org/~michaelk/Bangles.html | archive-date=February 20, 1999| url = http://www.seds.org/~michaelk/Bangles.html | title = The Story of The Bangles | access-date =August 11, 2010 }}</ref> In 1981, Hoffs and the Petersons recorded and released a single ("[[Getting Out of Hand]]" with "Call on Me" on the B side) on DownKiddie Records (their own label). The Bangs were signed to Faulty Products, a label formed by [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bangles |url=https://ramentertainment.com/bangles |website=RAM Entertainment |access-date=December 23, 2021 |date=August 26, 2013}}</ref>

The early Bangles lineup of Susanna Hoffs (vocals/guitars), Vicki Peterson (guitars/vocals), Debbi Peterson (vocals/drums) and [[Annette Zilinskas]] (vocals/bass) recorded an [[Bangles (EP)|EP in 1982]] and released the single "The Real World".  For the release of the EP, they played in the Lhasa club in Hollywood.  At the last minute, they discovered another band had registered the Bangs name and would not let them use it without payment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DeYoung |first1=Bill |title=Meet The Bangles |url=http://www.billdeyoung.com/music-archives/meet-the-bangles/ |access-date=December 23, 2021 |date=April 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401223023/http://www.billdeyoung.com/music-archives/meet-the-bangles/ |archive-date=April 1, 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the meantime, Hoffs and Vicki Peterson appeared on a 1983 album ''[[Rainy Day (band)|Rainy Day]]'' (also the name of the group) which also featured members of [[Rain Parade]], [[the Dream Syndicate]] and [[the Three O'Clock]]. The album was released in 1984 on Llama Records (E1024), and featured Hoffs on lead vocals on cover versions of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[I'll Keep It with Mine]]" and [[Lou Reed]]'s "[[I'll Be Your Mirror]]". 

Their first EP was retitled ''Bangles'' and released. In 1983, Faulty Products issued a 12-inch "remix" single of "The Real World" to radio and media, but another setback came as the label folded. [[I.R.S. Records]] picked up distribution and reissued the EP. After Zilinskas left the band to focus on her own project [[Blood on the Saddle]], she was replaced by [[Michael Steele (musician)|Michael Steele]], formerly of the all-female band [[the Runaways]], Toni & the Movers, [[Slow Children]] and [[Elton Duck]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=DeYoung |first1=Bill |title=The Bangles: California Dreamin' |url=http://www.billdeyoung.com/bangles.htm |access-date=December 23, 2021 |date=August 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822031919/http://www.billdeyoung.com/bangles.htm |archive-date=August 22, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=About chart-topping band The Bangles |url=http://www.thebangles.com/about_thebangles.html |website=THE BANGLES |access-date=December 23, 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

===Career peak (1984–1989)===
[[File:The Bangles, 1984.jpg|thumb|The Bangles in 1984]]
The Bangles' full-length debut album on [[Columbia Records]], ''[[All Over the Place (The Bangles album)|All Over the Place]]'' (1984), captured their [[power pop]] roots, featuring the singles "Hero Takes a Fall" and the [[Kimberley Rew]]-penned Beatlesque "[[Going Down to Liverpool]]" (originally recorded by Rew's band [[Katrina and the Waves]]). The record received positive reviews and the video for "Liverpool" featured [[Leonard Nimoy]], which helped to generate further publicity.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EegbAAAAIBAJ&pg=4471,4154485&dq=bangles+nimoy&hl=en |title= Spock Beams Down for Bangles' Video|first= E.A.|last= Vare|work= The Dispatch|date= October 31, 1984|access-date=June 13, 2011}}</ref> This came about through a friendship between the Hoffs and Nimoy families. They received a much wider audience serving as the opening act for [[Cyndi Lauper]] on her [[Fun Tour]].

All this went some way to attracting the attention of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], who gave them "[[Manic Monday]]" originally written for his group [[Apollonia 6]]. "Manic Monday" went on to become a number-two hit in the US, the UK and Germany, outsold at the time only by another Prince composition, his own "[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]". The band's second album, ''[[Different Light]]'' (January 1986), was more polished than its predecessor,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cinquemani |first=Sal |date=2003-09-23 |title=Review: The Bangles, Different Light |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/the-bangles-different-light/ |access-date=2025-02-02 |website=Slant Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> and with the help of the worldwide number-one hit "[[Walk Like an Egyptian]]" (written by [[Liam Sternberg]]), put the band firmly in the mainstream, reaching number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="Dickerson, Jim 1987 pp. 20">Dickerson, Jim (December 1987) "The Bangles: You Have to Enjoy it While It's There," Nine-o-One, pp. 20–23.</ref>

The song was sent to them in midsession and the group was divided about whether it would be a failure or a success. When the song was released, the group was amazed to discover that it brought them a new audience of female fans, most of them very young. Commented Michael Steele to a ''[[Nine-O-One Network|Nine-O-One Network Magazine]]'' writer: "When I go out now it is usually girls who recognize me."<ref name="Dickerson, Jim 1987 pp. 20"/> Three additional hit singles released from the ''Different Light'' album were: "[[Following (song)|Following]]" (top 40 in Ireland), "[[Walking Down Your Street]]" (number 11 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100) and the wistful "[[If She Knew What She Wants]]", written and first recorded by [[Jules Shear]] (which reached 29 on the Hot 100 in the summer of 1986 and was in the German top 20 for 13 weeks).<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1986-07-12| title=Billboard The Hot 100| magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}} {{cite web |url= https://hitparade.ch/song/Bangles/If-She-Knew-What-She-Wants-1455| title=Schweizer Hitparade|access-date=February 19, 2018}}</ref>

The band had another hit with a cover of [[Simon & Garfunkel]]'s "[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]" (1987) from [[Less than Zero (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] of the film ''[[Less than Zero (film)|Less than Zero]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://diffuser.fm/the-bangles-hazy-shade-of-winter/|title=30 Years Ago: The Bangles Rock Out for 'Less Than Zero'|first=Nick|last=DeRiso|website=Diffuser.fm|date=November 6, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/story-of-the-song-hazy-shade-of-winter-the-bangles-1987-2144463.html|title=Story of the Song: Hazy Shade of Winter, The Bangles (1987)|date=November 26, 2010|website=The Independent}}</ref> The song reached number 2 in February 1988.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-bangles|title=The Bangles|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>
[[File:901 December 1987.jpg|thumb|The Bangles on the cover of the December 1987 edition of ''[[Nine-O-One Network]]'']]
The album ''[[Everything (The Bangles album)|Everything]]'' (1988) was produced by [[Davitt Sigerson]], as the band had a negative reaction to working with [[David Kahne]] on ''Different Light''.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0RdQAAAAIBAJ&pg=5368,1027522 |title= Bangles Disavow Maturity|work= The Victoria Advocate|date= December 4, 1988|access-date=June 13, 2011}}</ref> It was another multiplatinum hit and included the top-five hit "[[In Your Room (The Bangles song)|In Your Room]]", as well as their biggest-selling single "[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]". Co-writer [[Billy Steinberg]] came up with the title after Hoffs told him about the band's recent trip to Memphis, Tennessee, where they visited [[Graceland]], [[Elvis Presley]]'s estate. An eternal flame is maintained at Presley's grave, but it had gone out on the day of their visit, and its clear plastic enclosure was flooded. They asked what was in the box and were told, "That's the eternal flame."<ref>Susanna Hoffs, "Commentary", the Bangles, ''Return to Bangleonia'', DVD, 2007</ref>

The single became their biggest worldwide hit and the biggest single by an all-female band in history.<ref>''Stichting Nederlandse Top 40, 500 Nr. 1 hits uit de Top 40'', page 261, 9023009444</ref> Hoffs was naked when she recorded the song, convinced by Sigerson that [[Olivia Newton-John]] got her amazing performances by recording everything naked.<ref>''Soundtrack to My Life'', Series 3, Hosted by Cat Deeley, interview with Vicki and Debbi Peterson and Susanna Hoffs</ref> Hoffs said she felt it was like 'skinny dipping' and recorded most of the rest of the album naked.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Amy|date=May 3, 2021|title='I did the vocals in the nude' – the Bangles on how they made Eternal Flame|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/may/03/vocals-nude-bangles-eternal-flame-susanna-hoffs-how-we-made|access-date=May 29, 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

===Disbandment (1989)===
Friction arose among band members after music industry media began singling out Hoffs as the lead singer of the group. In fact, singing duties on the band's albums were divided among the band's members, each of whom wrote or co-wrote songs. The band broke up in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/mar/14/artsfeatures.shopping|title=Interview: The Bangles|first=Dorian|last=Lynskey|date=March 14, 2003|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/no-more-manic-mondays-20050905-gdm07a.html|title=No more manic Mondays|date=September 5, 2005|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

Hoffs began a solo career and Vicki Peterson toured as a member of the [[Continental Drifters]] and as a fill-in member of [[the Go-Go's]].<ref>''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' p. 47. Fireside, 2001.</ref> Michael Steele joined a band that did not last long called Crash Wisdom, in which she performed songs such as "Nickel Romeo" and "Between the Two" which both would later be used for the Bangles's 2003 reunion album ''[[Doll Revolution]]''.

===Re-formation (1998–present)===
In 1998, the band reformed<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=807 |title=Anne Carlini – Exclusive Magazine |first=Russell |last=Trunk |work=annecarlini.com |year=2011 |quote=By 2000 we had already starting playing live shows and becoming more visible.

The title track, which was written by [[Elvis Costello]], was originally recorded for his 2002 album ''[[When I Was Cruel]]''. ''Doll Revolution'' was a solid comeback success in Germany after the Bangles had performed in Germany's biggest television show ''[[Wetten, dass..?|Wetten dass]]'', but failed to make any impact in other markets such as the UK, the U.S. and Australia.
