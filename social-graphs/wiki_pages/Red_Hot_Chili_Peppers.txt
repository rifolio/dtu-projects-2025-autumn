The Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, the guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]] and the drummer [[Jack Irons]]. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on their 1984 [[The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)|self-titled debut album]], which instead featured the guitarist [[Jack Sherman]] and the drummer [[Cliff Martinez]]. Slovak rejoined for their second album, ''[[Freaky Styley]]'' (1985), and Irons for their third, ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]'' (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.

With Frusciante and Smith, the Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded ''[[Mother's Milk (album)|Mother's Milk]]'' (1989) and their first major commercial success, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by [[Dave Navarro]]. Their next album, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'' (1995), failed to match the success of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.

In 1998, Navarro departed and Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. ''[[By the Way]]'' (2002) and ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' (2006) were also successful; ''Stadium Arcadium'' was their first album to reach number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by [[Josh Klinghoffer]], who appeared on ''[[I'm with You (album)|I'm with You]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Getaway (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|The Getaway]]'' (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. The Chili Peppers released their 12th and 13th albums, ''[[Unlimited Love]]'' and ''[[Return of the Dream Canteen]]'', in 2022.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles in 1982 as Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem by singer [[Anthony Kiedis]], guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]], bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], and drummer [[Jack Irons]], classmates at [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]].<ref name="amgbio">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5241|pure_url=yes}} |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers > Biography |access-date=June 5, 2007 |author=Prato, Greg |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Their first performance was on December 16, 1982, at the Grandia Room club on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] to a crowd of approximately 30. Gary Allen, a friend of the band, was hosting a release party for his new EP and asked Kiedis and Flea to put together an opening act.<ref name="Duncan-2023">{{Cite book |last=Duncan |first=Hamish |title=Out in L.A. : the Red Hot Chili Peppers 1983 |date=2023 |isbn=978-1-64160-801-5 |location=Chicago, Illinois |oclc=1333620372}}</ref>

At the time, Slovak and Irons were already committed to another group, [[What Is This?]]; however, the new band was asked to return the following week.<ref name="KiedisSloman106">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=106}}</ref> In March, they changed their name to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, playing several shows at Los Angeles venues.

The band released their debut album, ''[[The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)|The Red Hot Chili Peppers]]'', in August 1984.

In early 1986, EMI gave the Chili Peppers $5,000 to record a demo tape for their next album. They chose to work with producer [[Keith Levene]] from [[Public Image Ltd]], as he shared their interest in drugs.<ref name="KiedisSloman187">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=187}}</ref> Levene and Slovak put aside $2,000 of the budget to spend on heroin and [[cocaine]], which created tension between the band members. Martinez's "heart was no longer in the band", but he did not quit, so Kiedis and Flea fired him in April 1986.<ref name="KiedisSloman188">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=188}}</ref> Irons rejoined the band, to their surprise; it marked the first time all four founding members were together since 1983. During the recording and subsequent tour of ''Freaky Styley'', Kiedis and Slovak were dealing with debilitating heroin addictions. Due to his addiction, Kiedis "didn't have the same drive or desire to come up with ideas or lyrics" and appeared at rehearsal "literally asleep".<ref name="KiedisSloman191">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=191}}</ref>

For their third album, the Chili Peppers attempted to hire [[Rick Rubin]] to produce, but he declined due to the band's increasing drug problems. They eventually hired [[Michael Beinhorn]] from the art funk project [[Material (band)|Material]], their last choice.<ref name="Apter130-141">{{harvnb|Apter|2004|pp=130–141}}</ref> The early attempts at recording were halted due to Kiedis' worsening drug problems, and Kiedis was briefly fired.

The third Red Hot Chili Peppers album, ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]'', was released in September 1987 and peaked at No. 148 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart,<ref name="billalbums">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=red hot chili peppers|chart=Billboard 200}} |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Album & Song Chart History: Billboard 200 |access-date=December 26, 2011 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> a significant improvement over their earlier albums.

[[File:RickRubinSept09.jpg|thumb|[[Rick Rubin]] (pictured in 2009) has produced nearly every Red Hot Chili Peppers album since 1991|alt=|upright=0.8]]

In 1990, after the success of ''Mother's Milk'', the Chili Peppers left EMI and entered a major-label bidding war. They signed with [[Warner Bros. records|Warner Bros. Records]] and hired Rick Rubin, a producer they had tried to hire before. Rubin turned the band down in 1987 because of their drug problems but he felt that they were now healthier and more focused. He produced several more of their albums. The writing process was more productive than it had been for ''Mother's Milk'', with Kiedis saying, "[every day], there was new music for me to lyricize".<ref name="KiedisSloman264">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=264}}</ref> At Rubin's suggestion, they recorded in [[The Mansion (recording studio)|The Mansion]], a studio in a house in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] where magician [[Harry Houdini]] once lived.<ref name="pp274">Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 274–275</ref>

In September 1991, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' was released. "[[Give It Away (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)|Give It Away]]" was the first single, which achieved international fame and became the band's first number-one single on the [[Modern Rock Tracks|Modern Rock]] chart.<ref name="singleschart" /> The ballad "[[Under the Bridge]]" was the second single, and reached number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, the band's highest position to date.<ref name="singleschart" /> ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' sold over 12 million copies.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://top40.about.com/od/redhotchilipeppers/tp/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-Discography.htm |title = Red Hot Chili Peppers Discography |access-date = June 10, 2007 |author = Lamb, Bill |newspaper = About.com Entertainment |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130502161834/http://top40.about.com/od/redhotchilipeppers/tp/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-Discography.htm |archive-date = May 2, 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref> It was listed at number 310 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]], and in 1992 it rose to number three on the US album charts, almost a year after its release.

Frusciante was troubled by fame, and began falling out with Kiedis. He isolated himself and developed a secret heroin addiction.

===Vocals and instrumentation===
Kiedis provided multiple vocal styles. His primary approach up to ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' was spoken verse and rapping, which he complemented with traditional vocals. This helped the band to maintain a consistent style.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p93719|pure_url=yes}} |title=Anthony Kiedis Biography |access-date=August 8, 2007 |author=Sutton, Michael |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> As the group matured, notably with ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' (1999), they reduced the number of rapped verses. ''By the Way'' (2002) contained only two songs with a rap-driven verse and melodic chorus.<ref>Allmusic ''By the Way'' Album Review. [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r595243|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com]</ref> Kiedis' more recent style was developed through ongoing coaching.<ref name="KiedisSloman420">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=420}}</ref>

Original guitarist Slovak's style was based in blues and funk. Slovak was primarily influenced by hard-rock artists such as Hendrix, [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and Led Zeppelin,<ref name="MullenHillel">Mullen, p. 21</ref> while his playing method was based on improvisation common in funk.<ref name="Consequence">{{cite web |url = https://consequence.net/2008/07/icons-of-rock-hillel-slovak/ |title = Icons of Rock: Hillel Slovak |last = Sayers |first = Blaine |work = Consequence |date = July 23, 2008 |access-date = December 15, 2021 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130511130157/http://consequenceofsound.net/2008/07/icons-of-rock-hillel-slovak/ |archive-date = May 11, 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref> He was noted for an aggressive playing style; he would often play with such force, that his fingers would "come apart".<ref name="Consequence" /> Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This?, when Slovak adopted a more fluid style featuring "sultry" elements compared to his earlier hard-rock techniques.<ref>Kiedis, p. 168</ref> On ''The Uplift Mofo Party Plan'' (1987), Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including [[reggae]] and [[speed metal]].<ref>Kiedis, p. 204</ref> His guitar riffs often served as the basis of the group's songs, with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work. His melodic riff featured in the song "Behind the Sun" inspired the group to create "pretty" songs with an emphasis on melody.<ref name="KiedisSloman204" /> Kiedis describes the song as "pure Hillel inspiration".<ref>Slovak, p. 12</ref> Slovak also used a [[talk box]] on songs such as "Green Heaven" and "Funky Crime", in which he would sing into a tube while playing to create psychedelic effects.<ref>Kiedis, p. 112</ref>

Frusciante's guitar playing style has evolved over the course of his career, with a technique that employs melody and emotion rather than virtuosity.{{clarify|date=May 2020|problem=This word is too esoteric.}} Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this.<ref name=Kerrangspain>''Kerrang!'' Issue No.&nbsp;21; pp. 76–82</ref> Frusciante brought a melodic and textured sound, notably on ''Californication'', ''By the Way'', and ''Stadium Arcadium'' (2006). This contrasts with his earlier abrasive approach in ''Mother's Milk'',<ref>{{cite magazine |title = Total Guitar Magazine interview with John Frusciante |magazine = [[Total Guitar]] |url = http://rhcprock.free.fr/totalguitar_john.htm |access-date = May 14, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130530035451/http://rhcprock.free.fr/totalguitar_john.htm |archive-date = May 30, 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r16302|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic; Mother's Milk |access-date=August 8, 2007 |author=Hanson, Amy |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> as well as his dry, funky and more docile arrangements on ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. On ''Californication'' and ''By the Way'', Frusciante derived the technique of creating tonal texture through chord patterns from [[post-punk]] guitarist [[Vini Reilly]] of [[the Durutti Column]], and bands such as [[Fugazi]] and [[the Cure]].<ref name="tgm2002">Dalley, Helen (August 2002).

Flea's bass guitar style can be considered an amalgamation of funk, psychedelic, punk, and hard rock.<ref name="fleabio">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p76467|pure_url=yes}} |title=Flea Biography |access-date=August 8, 2007 |author=Prato, Greg |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The groove-heavy melodies, played through either finger-picking or [[slap bass|slapping]], contributed to their signature style. While Flea's slap bass style was prominent in earlier albums, albums after ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''<ref name="fleabio" /> have more melodic and funk-driven bass lines. He has also used [[double stop]]s on some newer songs. Flea's bass playing has changed considerably throughout the years. When he joined Fear, his technique centered largely around traditional punk-rock bass lines.<ref name=intbass>{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzkeyWNkhpY |title = Interview with Flea in 1988 |date = March 8, 2006 |access-date = January 16, 2008 |publisher = [[VPRO]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130505081705/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzkeyWNkhpY |archive-date = May 5, 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref> However, he changed this style when the Red Hot Chili Peppers formed. He began to incorporate a "slap" bass style that drew influence largely from [[Bootsy Collins]].<ref name="Apter70">{{harvnb|Apter|2004|p=70}}</ref> ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' saw a notable shift in style as it featured none of his signature technique but focused more on traditional and melodic roots.<ref name=bassplayermag>Malandrone, Scott (October 1995). "Flea Interview". ''Bass Player''.</ref> His intellectual beliefs as a musician also shifted: "I was trying to play simply on ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. When you play less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good."<ref name=bassplayermag />

Drummer Smith blends rock with funk, mixing metal and jazz to his beats. Influences include [[Buddy Rich]] and [[John Bonham]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sabian.com/en/artist/chad-smith |title = SABIAN Cymbals – Chad Smith |website = Sabian.com |access-date = September 10, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111103220408/http://www.sabian.com/en/artist/chad-smith |archive-date = November 3, 2011 |url-status = live}}</ref> He brought a different sound to ''Mother's Milk'', playing tight and fast. In ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', he displays greater power. He is recognized for his [[ghost note]]s, his beats and his fast right foot. MusicRadar put him in sixth place on their list of the "50 Greatest Drummers Of All Time".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/50-greatest-drummers-of-all-time-part-2-225815 |title = 50 greatest drummers of all time: part 2 |website = Musicradar.com |date = November 5, 2009 |access-date = August 8, 2023 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110714141407/http://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/50-greatest-drummers-of-all-time-part-2-225815/23#content |archive-date = July 14, 2011 |url-status = live}}</ref> During their early career, the Chili Peppers often performed nude, wearing only socks over their genitals; that became a part of their stage persona and brought them early notoriety.

=== Lyrical themes and inspirations ===
Early in the group's history, Kiedis wrote comical songs filled with sexual innuendos and songs inspired by friendship and the band members' personal experiences. However, after the death of his close friend and bandmate Hillel Slovak, Kiedis' lyrics became much more introspective and personal, as exemplified by the ''Mother's Milk'' song "Knock Me Down", which was dedicated to Slovak along with the ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' song "My Lovely Man". When the band recorded ''One Hot Minute'' (1995), Kiedis had turned to drugs once again, which resulted in darker lyrics.<ref name="Apter184-190">{{harvnb|Apter|2004|pp=184–190}}</ref> He began to write about anguish, and the self-mutilating thoughts he experienced as a result of his drug addiction.<ref name="rollingstonearticle">{{cite magazine |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/red-hot-chili-peppers-the-naked-truth-192368/ |title = Red Hot Chili Peppers: The Naked Truth |first = David |last = Fricke |access-date = December 15, 2021 |magazine = Rolling Stone  |date = June 25, 1992 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090316023649/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/articles/story/5938432/the_naked_truth |archive-date = March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name="KiedisSloman265-266">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|pp=265–266}}</ref> The album also featured tributes to close friends the band lost during the recording process including [[Kurt Cobain]] on the song "Tearjerker" and [[River Phoenix]] on the song "Transcending".

After witnessing Frusciante's recovery from his heroin addiction, Kiedis wrote many songs inspired by rebirth and the meaning of life on ''Californication''. He was also intrigued by the life lessons that the band had learned,<ref name="vh1rhcp">(2002) "[[Behind the Music]]: Red Hot Chili Peppers episode". [[VH1]].</ref> including Kiedis' experience with meeting a young mother at the [[YMCA]], who was attempting to battle her crack addiction while living with her infant daughter.<ref name="KiedisSloman404" />

On ''By the Way'', Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love and his girlfriend.<ref name="KiedisSloman456-465">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|pp=456–465}}</ref> Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he had only been sober since 2000.<ref name="KiedisSloman433">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=433}}</ref> Tracks such as "This Is the Place" and "Don't Forget Me" expressed his intense dislike for narcotics and the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him. ''Stadium Arcadium'' (2006) continued the themes of love and romance; Kiedis said, that "love and women, pregnancies and marriages, relationship struggles—those are real and profound influences on this record. And it's great, because it wasn't just me writing about the fact that I'm in love. It was everybody in the band. We were brimming with energy based on falling in love."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.invisible-movement.net/articles/2006-press/0601-rollingstone |title = Tattooed Love Boys &#124; John Frusciante unofficial website |website=Invisible Movement |access-date = February 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130603060432/http://invisible-movement.net/articles/2006-press/0601-rollingstone |archive-date = June 3, 2013 |df = mdy-all}}</ref> ''I'm with You'' (2011) again featured Kiedis writing about the loss of a close friend, this time in the song "Brendan's Death Song", a tribute to club owner [[Brendan Mullen]] who gave the band some of their earliest shows and showed support to them throughout their career.

Kiedis said the Red Hot Chili Peppers were early to combine "hardcore funk and hip-hop-style vocals", and suggested that they had influenced [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Kid Rock]] and [[Linkin Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anthonykiedis.net/magazine-scansarticles/2000-2005/2002-2/penthouse-jan-2002/ |title=01/2002 Penthouse |date=July 16, 2010 |website=Anthonykiedis.net |access-date=June 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630104625/http://anthonykiedis.net/magazine-scansarticles/2000-2005/2002-2/penthouse-jan-2002/ |archive-date=June 30, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Smith said, "Certainly Anthony's singing style and voice lends itself to being unique, and nobody sounds like him. The cool thing about it is we can play any style of music whether it's hard and fast, or loud or quiet, slow or medium, whatever it is; rock or funk, and it still sounds like us. I'm proud of that because sometimes bands don't have that strong personality where you go, 'Oh, that's boom, right away.'"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.zoiksonline.com/2012/08/chad-smith-of-red-hot-chili-peppers.html |title = Chad Smith of Red Hot Chili Peppers Talks About the Band's Sound and Longevity. – Interview |date = August 2012 |website = zoiksonline.com |access-date = August 13, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170630104625/http://www.zoiksonline.com/2012/08/chad-smith-of-red-hot-chili-peppers.html/ |archive-date = June 30, 2017 |url-status = live}}</ref>

In 2004, the Australian songwriter [[Nick Cave]] said: "I'm forever near a stereo saying, 'What the fuck is this garbage?' And the answer is always the Red Hot Chili Peppers." The line is widely quoted in criticism of the band; Flea, a fan of Cave, wrote that it had hurt him. In 2025, Cave wrote an apology on his website, saying it was "an offhand and somewhat uncharitable remark" with "no malice intended", and announced that he and Flea had recently collaborated.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Breihan |first=Tom |date=2025-03-12 |title=Nick Cave clarifies stance on Red Hot Chili Peppers, discusses forthcoming Flea collaboration |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2300054/nick-cave-clarifies-stance-on-red-hot-chili-peppers-discusses-forthcoming-flea-collaboration/news/ |access-date=2025-03-15 |website=[[Stereogum]] |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Connor |first=Roisin |date=2025-03-13 |title=Nick Cave addresses 'obnoxious' comment he made 25 years ago |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/nick-cave-flea-red-hot-chili-peppers-b2714332.html |access-date=2025-03-15 |website=[[The Independent]] |language=en}}</ref>

=== Conviction and sexual harassment ===

He exposed himself and pressed his penis to a woman's face against her wishes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Singer Anthony Kiedis convicted of sexual battery, indecent exposure |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/04/03/Singer-Anthony-Kiedis-convicted-of-sexual-battery-indecent-exposure/2421639115200/ |access-date=March 26, 2022 |website=UPI |language=en}}</ref> He was fined $1,000 on each charge.<ref name="Harrington-1990" /> In 1990, Kiedis said the incident was "blown way out of proportion by both the media and the prosecution", and was merely "a playful thing that happened backstage" with no intent of harm.<ref name="Harrington-1990" />

In 1990, Flea and Smith were arrested on charges of battery in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at a [[spring break]] performance for [[MTV]]. Flea was also charged with disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit an unnatural and lascivious act. Flea picked up a 20-year-old woman and threw her into the sand, while Smith forcibly removed her bathing suit and slapped her buttocks.<ref>{{cite web |date=March 16, 1990 |title=Two Members of Red Hot Chili Peppers Arrested Following Attack on Student |url=https://apnews.com/article/a7f2c8a2421e3a7e6b26724f600488e9 |access-date=November 22, 2021 |work=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Flea allegedly demanded that she perform oral sex on him before both he and Smith were removed by security.<ref>{{cite web |date=April 28, 2021 |title=No Chili: Examining the Forgotten Assaults of RHCP and the Industry That Allowed It |url=https://www.smackmedia.ca/news/rhcp-assaults-problematic-industry |access-date=November 23, 2021 |work=Smack Media}}</ref> After the arrest, the [[State University of New York at New Paltz]] canceled a Chili Peppers concert.<ref name="Harrington-1990">{{Cite news |last=Harrington |first=Richard |date=May 13, 1990 |title=The Medium is the Mayhem |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1990/05/13/the-medium-is-the-mayhem/72a4e924-517c-4716-b311-5d7647dd81e4/}}</ref> Flea and Smith pled guilty to all charges.

I was out of control. But I did not assault anybody, and it was not sexual.
