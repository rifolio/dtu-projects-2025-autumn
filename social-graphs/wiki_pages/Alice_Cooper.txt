==Early life==
Vincent Damon Furnier was born on February 4, 1948, in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the son of Ether Moroni Furnier (1924–1987) and his wife Ella Mae (''née'' McCart; 1925–2022). He was named after his uncle, Vincent Collier Furnier.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Fabulous Furniers |title=Alice Cooper, Golf Monster: A Rock 'n' Roller's 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict |isbn=9780307382917 |year=2008 |publisher=Crown}}</ref> His father was an evangelist in [[the Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)|The Church of Jesus Christ]],<ref name=People>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20063913,00.html |title=The Preacher's Son Who Became Alice Cooper |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=April 1, 1974 |access-date=November 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110181906/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20063913,00.html |archive-date= January 10, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> and his paternal grandfather Thurman Sylvester Furnier was a [[Quorum of Twelve Apostles (Bickertonite)|leader]]<ref name=People/> and later president (1963–1965) of that church organization.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=Alice |last2=Zimmerman |first2=Keith |year=2008 |title=Alice Cooper, Golf Monster: A Rock 'n' Roller's 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict |publisher= [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown]] |isbn= 978-0307382917 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1I-lN2IAo_wC&pg=PA9}}</ref>

==Career==
===1960s===
{{see also|Alice Cooper (band)}}

====The Spiders and Nazz====
In 1964, 16-year-old Furnier was eager to participate in Cortez High School's annual [[Letterman (sports)|Letterman's]] talent show, so he gathered four fellow [[Cross country running|cross country]] teammates to form a group for the show: [[Glen Buxton]], [[Dennis Dunaway]], John Tatum, and John Speer.<ref group=fn>Cooper describes in detail in his first autobiography, ''Me, Alice'' (1976), how he was tasked with organizing an act for the show.</ref> They named themselves the Earwigs.<ref name="Harkema">''[[Super Duper Alice Cooper]]'' (2014).

As a result of their positive experience, the group decided to try to turn into a real band. They acquired musical instruments from a local [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]] and proceeded to learn how to play them, with Buxton doing most of the teaching as well as much of the early songwriting.<ref name="rock lifestyle" /> They soon renamed themselves [[The Spiders (American rock band)|the Spiders]], featuring Furnier on lead vocals, Buxton on lead guitar, Tatum on rhythm guitar, Dunaway on bass guitar, and Speer on drums.<ref name="Harkema"/>

In 1966, the Spiders graduated from Cortez High School and, after [[North High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|North High School]] football player [[Michael Bruce (musician)|Michael Bruce]] replaced John Tatum on rhythm guitar, the band released their second single, "Don't Blow Your Mind", an original composition which became a local {{Numero|1}} hit, backed by "No Price Tag".<ref name="Harkema"/>

By 1967, the band had begun to make regular road trips to Los Angeles to play shows.<ref name="Harkema"/> They soon renamed themselves Nazz and released the single "Wonder Who's Lovin' Her Now", backed with future Alice Cooper track "Lay Down and Die, Goodbye". Around this time, drummer John Speer was replaced by [[Neal Smith (drummer)|Neal Smith]]. By the end of the year, the band relocated to Los Angeles.<ref name="Harkema"/>

====Name change to Alice Cooper====
In 1968, the band learned that [[Todd Rundgren]] also had a band called [[Nazz]], which was signed to a major label,  and found themselves in need of another name.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Luhrssen |first1=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phsIDgAAQBAJ |title=Encyclopedia of Classic Rock |last2=Larson |first2=Michael |date=February 24, 2017 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-4408-3514-8 |language=en}}</ref> Furnier also believed that the group needed a gimmick to succeed, and that other bands were not exploiting the showmanship potential of the stage.<ref name="Harkema"/> They chose the name "Alice Cooper" largely because it sounded innocuous and wholesome, in humorous contrast to the band's image and music. In his 2007 book ''Alice Cooper, Golf Monster'', Cooper stated that his look was inspired in part by films. One of the band's all-time favorite movies was ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962) starring [[Bette Davis]]: "In the movie, Bette wears disgusting caked makeup smeared on her face and underneath her eyes, with deep, dark, black eyeliner." Another movie the band watched over and over was ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968): "When I saw [[Anita Pallenberg]] playing the Great Tyrant in that movie in 1968, wearing [[evening glove|long black leather gloves]] with switchblades coming out of them, I thought, 'That's what Alice should look like.' That, and a little bit of [[Emma Peel]] from ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''."<ref name="Dmail2008">{{Cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.net/news/alice-coopers-barbarella-inspiration_1075609|title=Alice Cooper's Barbarella Inspiration|date=July 28, 2008|website=Contactmusic.com|access-date=April 7, 2020}}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The classic Alice Cooper group lineup consisted of Furnier, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, rhythm guitarist Michael Bruce, bassist Dennis Dunaway, and drummer Neal Smith.<ref name="Harkema"/> With the exception of Smith, who graduated from Camelback High School (which is referred to in the song "Alma Mater" on the band's fifth studio album ''[[School's Out (album)|School's Out]]''), all of the band members were on the Cortez High School cross-country team.<ref name="FactFiction">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PebLq32PvQ |title=Alice Cooper – Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? |work=YouTube |date=July 18, 2018 |access-date=July 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004161326/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PebLq32PvQ |archive-date=October 4, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Furnier, Buxton, and Dunaway were also art students, and their admiration for the works of [[Surrealism|surrealist]] artists such as [[Salvador Dalí]] further inspired their stage antics.<ref name="santabarbarasentinel">{{cite web |url=https://issuu.com/santabarbarasentinel/docs/_sntnl_43_2_full/8 |title=A Gentleman's Game |newspaper=Santa Barbara Sentinel |via=[[issuu]] |date=November 8, 2013 |access-date=April 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418220500/http://issuu.com/santabarbarasentinel/docs/_sntnl_43_2_full/8 |archive-date=April 18, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

One night after an unsuccessful gig at the Cheetah club in [[Venice, Los Angeles]], where the band emptied the entire room of patrons after playing just ten minutes, they were approached and enlisted by music manager [[Shep Gordon]], who saw the band's negative impact that night as a force that could be turned in a more productive direction.<ref name="Harkema"/> Shep then arranged an audition for the band with composer and renowned record producer [[Frank Zappa]], who was looking to sign bizarre music acts to his new record label, [[Straight Records]].<ref name="Harkema"/> For the audition Zappa told them to come to his house "at 7 o'clock." The band mistakenly assumed he meant 7 o'clock in the morning. Being woken up by a band willing to play that particular brand of psychedelic rock at seven in the morning impressed Zappa enough for him to sign them to a three-album deal. Another Zappa-signed act, the all-female [[The GTOs|GTOs]], who liked to "dress the Cooper boys up like full size [[Barbie]] dolls," played a major role in developing the band's early onstage look.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/people/p-christine.php |title=Miss Christine |work=SickthingsUK |date=November 5, 1972 |access-date=April 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420085327/http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/people/p-christine.php |archive-date=April 20, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref group=fn>[[Barry Miles]]'s biography of [[Frank Zappa]] includes a vivid description of how [[the GTOs]] influenced Cooper to wear makeup and dress in drag onstage.</ref>

The band's debut studio album, ''[[Pretties for You]]'' (1969), was eclectic and featured an experimental presentation of their songs in a psychedelic context.

Alice Cooper's "shock rock" reputation apparently developed almost by accident at first. An unrehearsed stage routine involving a feather pillow and a live chicken garnered attention from the press; the band decided to capitalize on the tabloid [[sensationalism]], creating in the process a new subgenre, [[shock rock]].<ref name="Harkema"/> Cooper claims that the infamous "Chicken Incident" at the [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]] concert in September 1969 was an accident.<ref name="Harkema"/> A chicken somehow made its way onto the stage into the feathers of a feather pillow that was opened during Cooper's performance and, not having any experience with farm animals, Cooper presumed that, because the chicken had wings, it would be able to fly.<ref name="Harkema"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.superseventies.com/ssalicecooper.html |title=Alice Cooper – In His Own Words |website=Superseventies.com |access-date=August 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117171045/http://superseventies.com/ssalicecooper.html |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> He picked it up and threw it out over the crowd, expecting it to fly away. The chicken instead plummeted into the first few rows occupied by wheelchair users, who reportedly proceeded to tear the bird to pieces.<ref group=fn>Cooper confirms this version of events in an interview in ''Alice Cooper: Prime Cuts''.</ref> The next day the incident made the front page of national newspapers, and Zappa phoned Cooper and asked if the story, which reported that he had bitten off the chicken's head and drunk its blood on stage, was true. Cooper denied the rumor, whereupon Zappa told him, "Well, whatever you do, don't tell anyone you didn't do it."<ref name="Harkema"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/marilyn2.htm |title=Marilyn Manson Kills Puppies |website=Snopes.com |date=January 11, 2010 |access-date=February 29, 2012}}</ref><ref group=fn>Five years later, the Chicken Incident was parodied in the second verse of the [[Ray Stevens]] song "The Moonlight Special", with Cooper referred to as ''Agnes Stoopa''.</ref>

The band later claimed that this period was highly influenced by [[Pink Floyd]], especially their debut studio album ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'' (1967), the only Pink Floyd album made under the leadership of founding member [[Syd Barrett]] (lead vocals and guitar). Glen Buxton said he could listen to Barrett's guitar for hours at a time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hellbound.ca/2011/08/alice-cooper-old-school-1964-1974/ |title=Alice Cooper – Old School 1964–1974 |first=Sean |last=Palmerston |website=Hellbound.ca |date=August 10, 2011 |access-date=February 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423003105/http://www.hellbound.ca/2011/08/alice-cooper-old-school-1964-1974/ |archive-date=April 23, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Alice Cooper band in 1970s: 1970–1975===
Despite the publicity from the chicken incident, the band's second studio album, ''[[Easy Action]]'', produced by [[David Briggs (record producer)|David Briggs]] and released in June 1970, fared even worse than its predecessor, entirely failing to chart within the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 200. Around this time, fed up with Californians' indifference to their act, they relocated to [[Pontiac, Michigan]], where their bizarre stage act was much better received by [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] crowds accustomed to the [[proto-punk]] styles of local bands such as [[the Stooges]] and [[the MC5]]. Despite this, Cooper still managed to receive a cream [[pieing|pie in the face]] when performing at the [[Midsummer Rock|Cincinnati Pop Festival]].

Alice Cooper appeared at the [[Woodstock]]-esque [[Strawberry Fields (Canadian festival)|Strawberry Fields Festival]] near [[Toronto]], Ontario, in August 1970. The band's mix of glam and increasingly violent stage theatrics stood out in stark contrast to the bearded, denim-clad hippie bands of the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roctober.com/roctober/behindthemusic3.html |title=Behind the Music Episode Guide, Part 3 |website=Roctober.com |access-date=April 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215152956/http://www.roctober.com/roctober/behindthemusic3.html |archive-date=February 15, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> As Cooper himself stated: "We were into fun, sex, death and money when everybody was into peace and love.

In autumn 1970, the Alice Cooper group teamed with producer [[Bob Ezrin]] for the recording of their third studio album, ''[[Love It to Death]]''. This was the final album in their Straight Records contract and the band's last chance to create a hit. That first success came with the single "[[I'm Eighteen]]", released in November 1970, which reached number 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in early 1971. Not long after the album's release in January 1971, [[Warner Records|Warner Bros. Records]] purchased Alice Cooper's contract from Straight and re-issued the album, giving the group a higher level of promotion.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lydon |first1=Michael |title=Me, Alice |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/05/23/archives/me-alice-starmaking-machinery.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 23, 1976 |access-date=December 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207043403/https://www.nytimes.com/1976/05/23/archives/me-alice-starmaking-machinery.html |archive-date=December 7, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

''Love It to Death'' proved to be their breakthrough studio album, reaching number 35 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album charts.

The group's 1971 tour featured a stage show involving mock fights and gothic torture modes being imposed on Cooper, climaxing in a staged execution by [[electric chair]], with the band sporting tight, sequined, color-contrasting [[glam rock]]-style costumes made by prominent rock-fashion designer Cindy Dunaway (sister of band member Neal Smith, and wife of band member Dennis Dunaway). Cooper's androgynous stage role had developed to present a [[villain]]ous side, portraying a potential threat to modern society. The success of the band's single and album, and their tour of 1971, which included their first tour of Europe (audience members reportedly included [[Elton John]] and a pre-[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]] [[David Bowie]]), provided enough encouragement for Warner Bros. to offer the band a new multi-album contract.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

[[File:Alice Cooper.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Cooper performing in 1972]]
Their follow-up studio album ''[[Killer (Alice Cooper album)|Killer]]'', released in November 1971, continued the commercial success of ''Love It to Death'' and included further single success with "[[Under My Wheels]]", "[[Be My Lover (Alice Cooper song)|Be My Lover]]" in early 1972, and "[[Halo of Flies (song)|Halo of Flies]]", which became a Top 10 hit in the Netherlands in 1973. Thematically, ''Killer'' expanded on the villainous side of Cooper's androgynous stage role, with its music becoming the soundtrack to the group's morality-based stage show, which by then featured a [[boa constrictor]] hugging Cooper on stage, the murderous axe chopping of bloodied baby dolls, and execution by hanging at the [[gallows]]. In January 1972, Cooper was again asked about his peculiar name, and told talk show hostess [[Dinah Shore]] that he took the name from a "[[Mayberry R.F.D.|Mayberry RFD]]" character.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The summer of 1972 saw the release of the single "[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]". It went Top 10 in the U.S. and to number 1 in the UK, and remains a staple on [[classic rock]] radio to this day. The studio album ''[[School's Out (album)|School's Out]]'' reached No. 2 on the US charts and sold over a million copies.

"[[Elected (song)|Elected]]", a late-1972 Top 10 UK hit from the album, which inspired one of the first [[MTV]]-style story-line promo videos ever made for a song (three years before [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s promotional video for "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]"), was followed by two more UK Top 10 singles, "[[Hello Hooray]]" and "[[No More Mr. Nice Guy (song)|No More Mr. Nice Guy]]", the latter of which was the last UK single from the album; it reached No. 25 in the US.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Alice Cooper – Chart History |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/278585/alice-cooper/chart |magazine=Billboard |access-date=December 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401062538/https://www.billboard.com/artist/278585/alice-cooper/chart |archive-date=April 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The title track, featuring guest vocals by [[Donovan]], was also a US hit single.

With a string of successful [[concept album]]s and several hit singles, the band continued their grueling schedule and toured the United States again. Continued attempts by politicians and pressure groups to ban their shocking act only served to fuel the legend of Alice Cooper further and generate even greater public interest.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Their 1973 US tour broke box office records previously set by [[the Rolling Stones]] and raised rock theatrics to new heights; the multi-level stage show by then featured numerous special effects, including Billion Dollar Bills, decapitated baby dolls and mannequins, a dental psychosis scene complete with dancing teeth, and the ultimate execution prop and highlight of the show: the [[guillotine]]. The guillotine and other stage effects were designed for the band by magician [[James Randi]], who appeared on stage during some of the shows as [[executioner]]. In 2012 at [[Dragon Con]], Randi and Cooper discussed their working relationship during this period.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Randi and Alice Cooper – Dragon*Con 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKpig-0_mOw|website=[[YouTube]]| date=February 20, 2013 |access-date=February 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227174424/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKpig-0_mOw&gl=US&hl=en&has_verified=1&bpctr=9999999999|archive-date=February 27, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The Alice Cooper group had now reached its peak and it was among the most visible and successful acts in the industry.

[[File:Alice cooper revista pelo 1974.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Cooper in 1974]]
''[[Muscle of Love]]'', released at the end of 1973, was to be the last studio album from the classic lineup, and marked Alice Cooper's last UK Top 20 single of the 1970s with "[[Teenage Lament '74]]". An unsolicited theme song was recorded for the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] spy film ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' (1974),<ref>{{Cite web |title=The best Bond themes that never made it |url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200218-the-best-james-bond-themes-that-never-made-it-to-the-screen |access-date=November 25, 2023 |website=www.bbc.com|date=February 18, 2020 }}</ref> but a different song of the same name by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] was chosen instead. By 1974, the ''Muscle of Love'' album still had not matched the top-charting success of its predecessor, and the band began to have constant disagreements. For various reasons, the members agreed to take what was expected to be a temporary hiatus. "Everyone decided they needed a rest from one another", said manager Shep Gordon at the time. "A lot of pressure had built up, but it's nothing that can't be dealt with. Everybody still gets together and talks." Journalist Bob Greene spent several weeks on the road with the band during the Muscle of Love Christmas Tour in 1973. His book ''Billion Dollar Baby'', released in November 1974, painted a less-than-flattering picture of the band, showing a group in total disharmony.<ref name="news.google.ca">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gD8dAAAAIBAJ&pg=3132,2262079&dq=dennis-dunaway+billion-dollar-babies&hl=en |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130115174817/http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=gD8dAAAAIBAJ&sjid=26YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3132,2262079&dq=dennis-dunaway+billion-dollar-babies&hl=en |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 15, 2013 |title=Billion Dollar Babies |work=[[Google News]]}}</ref> Cooper later wrote an autobiography with [[Steven Gaines]] called ''Me, Alice'' (1976) which gave Cooper's version of that era of his career, among other things.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chalmers |first1=Robert |title=Alice Cooper: Is it time for rock's oldest shocker to give up the gore? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/alice-cooper-is-it-time-for-rocks-oldest-shocker-to-give-up-the-gore-1729127.html |website=[[The Independent]] |date=October 22, 2011 |access-date=December 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206175115/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/alice-cooper-is-it-time-for-rocks-oldest-shocker-to-give-up-the-gore-1729127.html |archive-date=December 6, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Lair Of The Hollywood Vampires.png|thumb|In the 1970s, Cooper founded a celebrity drinking club, [[the Hollywood Vampires]], headquartered at the [[Rainbow Bar and Grill]] in [[West Hollywood, California]]]]
During this time, Cooper relocated back to Los Angeles and started appearing regularly on television shows such as ''[[Hollywood Squares|The Hollywood Squares]]'', and Warner Bros. released the ''[[Greatest Hits (Alice Cooper album)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation album. It featured classic-style artwork and reached the US Top 10, performing better than ''Muscle of Love''. However, the band's 1974 feature film ''[[Good to See You Again, Alice Cooper]]'' (consisting mainly of 1973 concert footage with 'comedic' sketches woven throughout to a faint storyline), released on a minor [[Movie theater|cinematic]] run mostly to [[drive-in theater]]s, saw little box office success. On March 5, 1974, Cooper appeared on episode 3 of ''[[The Snoop Sisters]]'' playing a [[Satanism|Satanic]] cult singer. The final shows by Alice Cooper as a group were in Brazil in March and April 1974, including the record indoor attendance estimated as high as 158,000 fans in São Paulo on March 30, at the Anhembi Exposition Hall at the start of the first ever South American rock tour.<ref>{{cite web |title=Billion Dollar Babies Band Live Album Due |url=https://bestclassicbands.com/billion-dollar-babies-reissue-12-5-17/ |website=Best Classic Bands |date=June 9, 2015 |access-date=December 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207155709/https://bestclassicbands.com/billion-dollar-babies-reissue-12-5-17/ |archive-date=December 7, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Alice Cooper solo: 1975–1980===
In 1975, Alice Cooper returned as a solo artist with the release of ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]''. To avoid legal complications over ownership of the group name, "Alice Cooper" had by then become Furnier's new legal name. Speaking on the subject of Alice Cooper continuing as a solo project as opposed to the band it once was, Cooper stated in 1975, "It got very basically down to the fact that we had drawn as much as we could out of each other. After ten years, we got pretty dry together." Manager Gordon added, "What had started in a sense as a pipe-dream became an overwhelming burden."<ref name="news.google.ca"/> The success of ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'' marked the final breakup of the original members of the band, with Cooper collaborating with their producer Bob Ezrin, who recruited [[Lou Reed]]'s backing band, including guitarists [[Dick Wagner]] and [[Steve Hunter]], to play on the album. Spearheaded by the US Top 20 hit ballad "[[Only Women Bleed]]", the album was released by [[Atlantic Records]] in March of that year and became a Top 10 hit for Cooper. It was a concept album that was based on the nightmare of a child named Steven, featuring narration by classic horror movie film star [[Vincent Price]], and serving as the soundtrack to Cooper's new stage show, which now showcased more theatrics than ever, including an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} furry [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] which Cooper decapitated and killed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Accompanying the album and stage show was the television special ''The Nightmare'', starring Cooper and [[Vincent Price]], which aired on US prime-time TV in April 1975. ''The Nightmare'' (which was later released on home video in 1983 and gained a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film|Best Long Form Music Video]]) was regarded as another groundbreaking moment in rock history. Adding to it all, a concert film, ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare (film)|Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', produced, directed, and choreographed by ''[[West Side Story]]'' cast member [[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]] and filmed live at London's [[Wembley Arena]] in September 1975, was released to theaters in 1976. The film was released in a special edition DVD in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alice Cooper to release 'Welcome to My Nightmare' special edition DVD |url=https://www.axs.com/alice-cooper-to-release-welcome-to-my-nightmare-special-edition-dvd-th-120823 |website=[[AXS (company)|AXS]] |access-date=December 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206191608/https://www.axs.com/alice-cooper-to-release-welcome-to-my-nightmare-special-edition-dvd-th-120823 |archive-date=December 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Such was the immense success of Cooper's solo project that he decided to continue as a solo artist, and the original band became officially defunct. Bruce, Dunaway, and Smith went on to form the short-lived band Billion Dollar Babies, producing one studio album—''Battle Axe''—in 1977. While occasionally performing with one another and [[Glen Buxton]], they did not reunite with Alice until October 23, 1999, at the second Glen Buxton Memorial Weekend for a show at CoopersTown in Phoenix. They reunited for another show, with [[Steve Hunter]] on guitar, on December 16, 2010, at the [[Arizona Financial Theatre|Dodge Theatre]] in Phoenix.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxuPXFuhBSQ |title=Alice Cooper – Dennis Dunaway Interview |website=YouTube |date=October 30, 2011 |access-date=April 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016190220/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxuPXFuhBSQ |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> This lineup performed together again (televised) on March 14, 2011, at the induction of the original Alice Cooper group into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], as well as on May 11, 2011, at London's [[Battersea Power Station]] at the [[Jägermeister]] Ice Cold 4D event (webcast). In 2011, Bruce, Dunaway, and Smith appeared on three tracks they co-wrote on Alice's solo studio album ''[[Welcome 2 My Nightmare]]''. In 2017, they appeared on two tracks they co-wrote on Alice's solo studio album ''[[Paranormal (Alice Cooper album)|Paranormal]]'', released in July, and in November they joined his current live band for five tour dates in the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Following the 1976 US No. 12 ballad hit "[[I Never Cry]]";<ref name="Ezrin"/> two studio albums, ''[[Alice Cooper Goes to Hell]]'' and ''[[Lace and Whiskey]]''; and the 1977 US No. 9 ballad hit "[[You and Me (Alice Cooper song)|You and Me]]", it became clear during his 1977 US tour that Cooper was in dire need of help with his alcoholism (at his alcoholic peak it was rumored that he was consuming up to two cases of [[Budweiser]] beer and a bottle of [[Seagram's Seven Crown]] whiskey a day). Following the tour, Cooper had himself hospitalized in a sanitarium for treatment, during which time the live album ''[[The Alice Cooper Show]]'' was released.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Alice Cooper Show – Alice Cooper |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-alice-cooper-show-mw0000189513 |website=AllMusic |access-date=December 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423184303/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-alice-cooper-show-mw0000189513 |archive-date=April 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1978, a [[sobriety|sobered]] Cooper used his experience in the sanitarium as the inspiration for his semi-autobiographical studio album ''[[From the Inside (Alice Cooper album)|From the Inside]]'', which he co-wrote with [[Bernie Taupin]], known for his work with Elton John; it spawned yet another US Top 20 hit ballad, "[[How You Gonna See Me Now]]". The subsequent tour's stage show was based inside an asylum, and was filmed for Cooper's first home-video release, ''[[The Strange Case of Alice Cooper]]'', in 1979. Around this time, Cooper performed "Welcome to My Nightmare", "You and Me", and "School's Out" on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' (episode #307) on March 28, 1978 (he played one of the [[devil]]'s henchmen trying to dupe [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] and [[Miss Piggy]] into selling their souls). He also appeared in an against-typecasting role as a piano-playing disco waiter in [[Mae West]]'s final film, ''[[Sextette]]'', and as a villain in the film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. Cooper also led celebrities in raising money to remodel the famous [[Hollywood Sign]] in Los Angeles, California. Cooper himself contributed over $27,000 to the project, buying an O in the sign in memory of close friend and comedian [[Groucho Marx]]. In 1979, Cooper also guest starred on good friend [[Soupy Sales]]' show, ''[[Soupy Sales#Lunch with Soupy Sales|Lunch with Soupy Sales]]'' and was hit in the face with a pie, as part of the show. When asked about the experience, Cooper had this to say about his friend: "Being from Detroit, I came home every day and watched Soupy at lunch (Lunch with Soupy Sales). One of the greatest moments of my life was getting pie-faced by Soupy. He was one of my all time heroes."<ref>{{cite web |title=Alice Cooper gets pied in the face on 'The Soupy Sales Show' |url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/alice_cooper_gets_pied_in_the_face_on_the_soupy_sales_show |website=Dangerous Minds |date=October 16, 2018 |access-date=December 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207044205/https://dangerousminds.net/comments/alice_cooper_gets_pied_in_the_face_on_the_soupy_sales_show |archive-date=December 7, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===1980s===
Cooper's studio albums from the beginning of the 1980s have been referred to by Cooper as his "blackout albums" because he cannot remember recording them, owing to the influence of his new, and increasing, cocaine addiction. ''[[Flush the Fashion]]'' (1980), ''[[Special Forces (Alice Cooper album)|Special Forces]]'' (1981), ''[[Zipper Catches Skin]]'' (1982) and ''[[DaDa]]'' (1983) saw a gradual commercial decline, with the last two not charting within the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Top 200. ''Flush the Fashion'', produced by [[Roy Thomas Baker]], known for his work with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[the Cars]], had a thick, edgy [[New wave music|new wave]] musical sound that baffled even longtime fans, though it still yielded the US Top 40 hit "[[Clones (We're All)]]". The track also surprisingly charted on the US [[Dance Club Songs|Disco Top 100]] chart. ''Special Forces'' featured a more aggressive but consistent new wave style, and included a new version of "Generation Landslide" from ''Billion Dollar Babies'' (1973). His tour for ''Special Forces'' marked Cooper's last time on the road for nearly five years; it was not until 1986, for ''[[Constrictor (album)|Constrictor]]'', that he toured again. 1982's ''Zipper Catches Skin'' was a more [[pop punk]]-oriented recording, containing many quirky high-energy guitar-driven songs along with his most unusual collection of subject matters for lyrics, and [[Patty Donahue]] of [[the Waitresses]] provided guest vocals and "sarcasm" on the track "I Like Girls". 1983 marked the return collaboration of producer [[Bob Ezrin]] and guitarist [[Dick Wagner]] for the haunting epic ''DaDa'', the final studio album in his Warner Bros. contract.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alice Cooper – DaDa |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dada-mw0000461389 |website=AllMusic |access-date=November 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423184309/https://www.allmusic.com/album/dada-mw0000461389 |archive-date=April 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In mid-1983, after the recording of ''DaDa'' was completed, Cooper was hospitalized for alcoholism again, and [[cirrhosis]] of the liver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/content.php?id=timelines/t-zcs.php |title=Timeline – Zipper Catches Skin |work=SickthingsUK |access-date=April 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319133014/http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/content.php?id=timelines%2Ft-zcs.php |archive-date=March 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He credits his Christian faith for a recovery doctors described as "miraculous" and he talks of how he did not "recover" but how his addiction was "taken away" by [[Jesus Christ]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Alice Cooper: A Testimony of Finding Purpose Through God's Grace|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqkzpZYLwTs|website=Youtube | date=August 7, 2024 |access-date=May 6, 2025}}</ref> Cooper was finally stable and sober (and has remained sober since that time) by the time ''DaDa'' and ''The Nightmare'' home video (of his 1975 TV Special) were released in the fall of that year; however, both releases performed below expectations. Even with ''The Nightmare'' scoring a nomination for 1984's [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film|Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]] (he lost to [[Duran Duran]]), it was not enough for Warner Bros. to keep Cooper on their books. By February 1984, Cooper became a "free agent" for the first time in his career.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Alice Cooper Survived The 80s |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/alice-cooper-survived-80s/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=November 7, 2016 |access-date=December 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720151417/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/alice-cooper-survived-80s/ |archive-date=July 20, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cooper spent a lengthy period away from the music business dealing with personal problems. His divorce from [[Sheryl Cooper]] was heard at Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona, on January 30, 1984, but a decision was made by the couple not to move forward with the divorce. The following month he guested at the [[26th Annual Grammy Awards]] alongside co-presenter [[Grace Jones]]. Behind the scenes Cooper kept busy musically, working on new material in collaboration with [[Aerosmith]] guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]]. The spring of 1984 was taken up with filming, Cooper acting in the [[B movie|B-grade]] horror movie ''[[Monster Dog]]'', filmed in [[Torrelodones]], Spain. Shortly thereafter he reconciled with Sheryl; the couple relocated to Chicago. The year closed with more writing sessions, this time in New York during November with [[Hanoi Rocks]] guitarist [[Andy McCoy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/united+states/michigan/detroit/alice+cooper |title=MusicMight :: Artists :: Alice Cooper |website=Rockdetector.com |access-date=April 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328223310/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/united+states/michigan/detroit/alice+cooper |archive-date=March 28, 2014 }}</ref> In 1985, he met and began writing songs with guitarist [[Kane Roberts]]. Cooper was subsequently signed to [[MCA Records]], and appeared as guest vocalist on [[Twisted Sister]]'s song "Be Chrool to Your Scuel". A music video was made for the song, featuring actor [[Luke Perry]] and Cooper donning his black snake-eyes makeup for the first time since 1979, but neither the song nor the video drew public interest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Luke Perry Went to Zombie High in a Banned Twisted Sister Video Pre-90210 |url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/luke-perry-zombie-high-twisted-sister-video-pre-90210-1203154965/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=March 5, 2019 |access-date=December 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808212329/https://variety.com/2019/music/news/luke-perry-zombie-high-twisted-sister-video-pre-90210-1203154965/ |archive-date=August 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1986, Alice Cooper officially returned to the music industry with the studio album ''[[Constrictor (album)|Constrictor]]''. The album spawned the hits "[[He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)]]" (the theme song for the movie ''[[Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives]]''; in the video for the song Cooper was given a cameo role as a deranged psychiatrist) and the fan favorite "[[Teenage Frankenstein]]". The ''Constrictor'' album was a catalyst for Cooper to make a triumphant return to the road for the first time since the 1981 ''Special Forces'' project, on a tour titled The Nightmare Returns. The Detroit leg of this tour, which took place at the end of October 1986 during [[Halloween]], was captured on film as ''[[The Nightmare Returns]]'' (1987), and is viewed by some as being the definitive Alice Cooper concert film. It was released on DVD in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alice Cooper: 'The Nightmare Returns' To Receive DVD Release Tomorrow |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/alice-cooper-the-nightmare-returns-to-receive-dvd-release-tomorrow/ |website=[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]] |date=July 31, 2006 |access-date=December 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191205162551/https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/alice-cooper-the-nightmare-returns-to-receive-dvd-release-tomorrow/ |archive-date=December 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The concert, which received rave reviews in the rock music press,<ref group=fn>For example, see the November 13, 1986, issue of ''[[Kerrang!]]'' music magazine, whose front cover bears the headline 'The Night He Came Home ... Alice Knocks 'Em Dead in Detroit'.</ref> was also described by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine as bringing "Cooper's violent, twisted onstage fantasies to a new generation". The ''Constrictor'' album was followed by ''[[Raise Your Fist and Yell]]'' in 1987, which had an even rougher sound than its predecessor, as well as the Cooper classic "[[Freedom (Alice Cooper song)|Freedom]]". The subsequent tour of ''Raise Your Fist and Yell'', which was heavily inspired by the slasher horror movies of the time such as the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' series and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', served up a shocking spectacle similar to its predecessor, and courted the kind of controversy, especially in Europe, that recalled the public outrage caused by Cooper's public performances in America in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Raise Your Fist and Yell – Alice Cooper |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/raise-your-fist-and-yell-mw0000651209 |website=AllMusic |access-date=November 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423184247/https://www.allmusic.com/album/raise-your-fist-and-yell-mw0000651209 |archive-date=April 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In Britain, Labour MP [[David Blunkett]] called for the show to be banned, saying "I'm horrified by his behaviour – it goes beyond the bounds of entertainment." The controversy spilled over into the German segment of the tour, with the German government actually succeeding in having some of the gorier segments of the performance removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/timelines/t-ryfay.php |title=Timeline: Raise Your Fist And Yell 1987 |work=SickthingsUK |access-date=April 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318030447/http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/timelines/t-ryfay.php |archive-date=March 18, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was also during the London leg of the tour that Cooper met with a near fatal accident during rehearsal of the hanging execution sequence that occurs at the end of the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/theatrics/gallows.php |title=The Gallows |work=SickthingsUK |access-date=April 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318030452/http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/theatrics/gallows.php |archive-date=March 18, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''Constrictor'' (1986) and ''Raise Your Fist and Yell'' (1987) were recorded with lead guitarist [[Kane Roberts]] and bassist [[Kip Winger]], both of whom left the band by the end of 1988 (although Kane Roberts played guitar on "[[Bed of Nails (song)|Bed of Nails]]" on Cooper's 1989 studio album ''[[Trash (Alice Cooper album)|Trash]]'').

In 1987, Cooper made a brief appearance as a vagrant in the supernatural horror film ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'', directed by [[John Carpenter]]. His role had no lines and consisted of generally menacing the protagonists before eventually impaling one of them with a bicycle frame.<ref>{{cite news |title=Film: 'Prince of Darkness,' by John Carpenter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/23/movies/film-prince-of-darkness-by-john-carpenter.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 23, 1987 |access-date=October 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523145644/https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/23/movies/film-prince-of-darkness-by-john-carpenter.html |archive-date=May 23, 2019 |url-status=live |last1=Canby |first1=Vincent }}</ref>

Also in 1987, Cooper appeared at [[WrestleMania III]], escorting wrestler [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]] to the ring for his match against [[The Honky Tonk Man]]. After the match, which Roberts lost, ended, Cooper got involved and threw Jake's snake Damien at Honky's manager [[Jimmy Hart]]. Roberts considered the involvement of Cooper to be an honor, as he had idolized Cooper in his youth and was still a huge fan. WrestleMania III, which attracted a [[WWE|WWF]] record 93,173 fans, was held in the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] near Cooper's home town of Detroit.<ref>{{cite web |title=When Alice Cooper Slithered Into Action at WrestleMania III |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/alice-cooper-wrestlemania-iii/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=March 31, 2017 |access-date=October 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031143443/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/alice-cooper-wrestlemania-iii/ |archive-date=October 31, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cooper recorded a music video for the "Poison" B-side "[[I Got a Line on You]]" after the song was featured on the soundtrack to ''[[Iron Eagle II]]'' (1988).<ref>{{cite web |title=Iron Eagle 2 – Original Soundtrack |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/iron-eagle-2-mw0000198110 |website=AllMusic |access-date=December 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206164758/https://www.allmusic.com/album/iron-eagle-2-mw0000198110 |archive-date=December 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On April 7, 1988, Cooper nearly died of asphyxiation after a safety rope broke during a rehearsal concert wherein he pretended to hang himself, a stunt he often performed during live concerts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1988-alice-cooper-nearly-dies-of-asphyxiation-after/ |title=Rock History – 1988 – Alice Cooper nearly dies of asphyxiation after... |website=Thisdayinrock.com |date=April 7, 1988 |access-date=August 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603215754/http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1988-alice-cooper-nearly-dies-of-asphyxiation-after/ |archive-date=June 3, 2013 |url-status=usurped }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/category/wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/|title=Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? > Loudwire|website= [[Loudwire]]|language=en|access-date=July 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720225458/http://loudwire.com/category/wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/|archive-date=July 20, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1988, Cooper's contract with MCA Records expired and he signed with [[Epic Records]]. Then in 1989 his career finally experienced a legitimate revival with the [[Desmond Child]] produced and [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]]-nominated studio album ''[[Trash (Alice Cooper album)|Trash]]'', which spawned a hit single "[[Poison (Alice Cooper song)|Poison]]", which reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 7 in the US, and a worldwide [[concert|arena tour]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Trash – Alice Cooper |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/trash-mw0000204877 |website=AllMusic |access-date=November 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423184257/https://www.allmusic.com/album/trash-mw0000204877 |archive-date=April 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===1990s===
In 1991, Cooper released his nineteenth studio album ''[[Hey Stoopid]]'' featuring several notable rock musicians guesting on the record. Released as [[glam metal]]'s popularity was on the wane, and just before the explosion of [[grunge]], it failed to have the same commercial impact as its predecessor. The same year also saw the release of the video ''Alice Cooper: Prime Cuts'' which chronicled his entire career using in depth interviews with Cooper himself, Bob Ezrin, and Shep Gordon. One critic has noted that ''Prime Cuts'' demonstrates how Cooper had used (in contrast to similar artists who succeeded him) themes of satire and moralization to such good effect throughout his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=3619 |title=Alice Cooper – Prime Cuts |first=Mark |last=Boydell |website=DVDtimes.co.uk |date=April 25, 2002 |access-date=August 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112225552/http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=3619 |archive-date=January 12, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was in the ''Prime Cuts'' video that Bob Ezrin delivered his own summation of the Alice Cooper persona: "He is the psycho killer in all of us. He's the axe murderer, he's the spoiled child, he's the abuser, he's the abused; he's the perpetrator, he's the victim, he's the gun slinger, and he's the guy lying dead in the middle of the street".<ref>Shep Gordon interview for ''Prime Cuts''.</ref>

During the early 1990s, Cooper guested on records by the most successful bands of the time, such as the [[Guns N' Roses]] third studio album ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'', on which he shared vocal duties with [[Axl Rose]] on the track "[[The Garden (Guns N' Roses song)|The Garden]]". He also had a brief appearance as the abusive stepfather of [[Freddy Krueger]] in the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' slasher film ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite news |title=Review/Film; Ending With Class, if an End It Is |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/14/movies/review-film-ending-with-class-if-an-end-it-is.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 14, 1991 |access-date=October 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029084522/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/14/movies/review-film-ending-with-class-if-an-end-it-is.html |archive-date=October 29, 2019 |url-status=live |last1=Maslin |first1=Janet }}</ref>

Cooper made a cameo appearance in the 1992 comedy film ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]''. Cooper and his band first appear on stage performing "Feed My Frankenstein" from their studio album ''Hey Stoopid''. Afterwards at a backstage party, the movie's main characters Wayne Cambell and Garth Algar discover that when offstage, Cooper is a calm, articulate intellectual as he and his band discuss the history of [[Milwaukee]] in depth. Wayne and Garth respond to an invitation to hang out with Cooper by kneeling and bowing reverently before him while chanting "We're not worthy! We're not worthy!"<ref>{{cite web |title=Alice Cooper reflects on legendary 'Wayne's World' scene 25 years later |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/alice-cooper-reflects-legendary-waynes-world-scene-25-years-later-1970567 |website=NME |date=February 8, 2017 |access-date=November 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213153115/https://www.nme.com/news/music/alice-cooper-reflects-legendary-waynes-world-scene-25-years-later-1970567 |archive-date=December 13, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1994, Cooper released ''[[The Last Temptation (Alice Cooper album)|The Last Temptation]]'', his first concept album since ''DaDa'' (1983). The album deals with issues of faith, temptation, alienation and the frustrations of modern life, and has been described as "a young man's struggle to see the truth through the distractions of the 'Sideshow' of the modern world".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Alice_Cooper_The_shock_rock_pioneer_speaks_about_his_Christian_faith/30163/p1/ |title=Alice Cooper: The shock rock pioneer speaks about his Christian faith |first=Darren |last=Hirst |website=Crossrhythms.co.uk |date=January 3, 2008 |access-date=August 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011145055/http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Alice_Cooper_The_shock_rock_pioneer_speaks_about_his_Christian_faith/30163/p1/ |archive-date=October 11, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Concurrent with the release of ''The Last Temptation'' was a three-part comic book series written by [[Neil Gaiman]], fleshing out the album's story. This was to be Cooper's last album with Epic Records since according to Brian 'Renfield' Nelson, Cooper's personal assistant, "Alice was interested in going to [[Hollywood Records]] even before 'The Last Temptation' was released because Bob Pfeifer, who originally signed Alice to Epic, was now the President of Hollywood Records. After 'The Last Temptation' was finished, Alice requested that [[Sony Music|Sony]]/Epic let him go so that he could make the switch to Hollywood. He just wanted to go where his friends are." and was his last studio release for six years, though during this period the live album ''[[A Fistful of Alice]]'' (1997)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rarebird9.net/alicecooper.html |title=Alice Cooper |work=Rarebird's Rock And Roll Rarity Reviews |access-date=February 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225051930/http://rarebird9.net/alicecooper.html |archive-date=February 25, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> was released, and in 1997 he lent his voice to the intro track of [[Insane Clown Posse]]'s ''[[The Great Milenko]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Great Milenko |url=https://ew.com/article/1997/07/25/great-milenko/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=October 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029085916/https://ew.com/article/1997/07/25/great-milenko/ |archive-date=October 29, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During his absence from the recording studio, Cooper toured extensively every year throughout the latter part of the 1990s, including, in 1996, South America, which he had not visited since 1974. Also in 1996, Cooper sang the role of [[Herod Antipas|Herod]] on the London cast recording of the musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (1996 London Cast)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1142886/a/Jesus+Christ+Superstar.htm |title=Jesus Christ Superstar CD Tracks |website=CDuniverse.com |date=March 7, 2000 |access-date=August 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609155953/http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1142886/a/Jesus+Christ+Superstar.htm |archive-date=June 9, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===2000s===
[[File:Cooper, Alice (Flickr).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Cooper in 2006]]
The first decade of the 21st century saw a sustained period of activity from Alice Cooper, the decade in which he turned 60. He toured extensively releasing a steady stream of studio albums to favorable critical acclaim. Beginning in 2000 with ''[[Brutal Planet]]'', a return to horror-filled heavy metal, [[industrial rock]], set in a [[dystopia]]n post-apocalyptic future.<ref name="canoe2000">{{cite web |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/C/Cooper_Alice/2000/08/29/744188.html |title=Artists – Cooper, Alice : Reality scares Alice |work=CANOE – JAM! |date=August 29, 2000 |access-date=April 8, 2012 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712212825/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/C/Cooper_Alice/2000/08/29/744188.html |archive-date=July 12, 2012 }}</ref> The album was produced by [[Bob Marlette]], with longtime Cooper production collaborator [[Bob Ezrin]] returning as executive producer. The accompanying world tour, which included Cooper's first concert in Russia, also resulted in ''[[Alice Cooper: Brutally Live|Brutally Live]]'' (2000), a DVD of a concert, recorded in London, England, on July 19, 2000.<ref name="brutally">{{cite AV media

Cooper made a guest appearance in 2001 on a third-season episode of ''[[That '70s Show]]'' titled "Radio Daze", in which he partook in a game of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=10 Memorable That 70s Show Guest stars |url=https://www.ifc.com/2016/06/that-70s-show-guest-stars |website=IFC.com |access-date=December 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807003143/https://www.ifc.com/2016/06/that-70s-show-guest-stars |archive-date=August 7, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

''Brutal Planet'' was succeeded by the sonically similar and acclaimed sequel ''[[Dragontown]]'' (2001), which saw [[Bob Ezrin]] back as producer. The album has been described as leading the listener down "a nightmarish path into the mind of rock's original conceptual storyteller"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=2056773 |title=Alice Cooper – Dragontown CD |website=CDuniverse.com |date=October 9, 2001 |access-date=August 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610224205/http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=2056773 |archive-date=June 10, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> and by Cooper himself as being "the worst town on Brutal Planet". Like ''The Last Temptation'', both ''Brutal Planet'' and ''Dragontown'' are albums which explore Cooper's born-again Christianity.

Cooper again adopted a leaner, cleaner sound for his critically acclaimed 2003 release ''[[The Eyes of Alice Cooper]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/alice-cooper.htm |title=Alice Cooper – The Eyes Of Alice Cooper |work=[[MusicOMH]] |access-date=April 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009101505/http://www.musicomh.com/albums/alice-cooper.htm |archive-date=October 9, 2012 }}</ref> Recognizing that many contemporary bands were having great success with his former sounds and styles, Cooper worked with a somewhat younger group of road and studio musicians who were familiar with his oeuvre of old.

Cooper's radio show ''[[Nights with Alice Cooper]]'' began airing on January 26, 2004, in several US cities.

A continuation of the songwriting approach adopted on ''The Eyes of Alice Cooper'' was again adopted by Cooper for his seventeenth solo studio album ''[[Dirty Diamonds]]'', released in 2005. ''Dirty Diamonds'' became Cooper's highest-charting album since 1994's ''The Last Temptation'' at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dirty-diamonds-is-alice-cooper-s-highest-charting-album-in-11-years/ |title='Dirty Diamonds' Is Alice Cooper's Highest-Charting Album in 11 Years |date=August 11, 2005 |website=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=August 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016190221/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dirty-diamonds-is-alice-cooper-s-highest-charting-album-in-11-years/ |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Dirty Diamonds tour launched in America in August 2005 after several European concerts, including a performance at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland on July 12. Cooper and his band, including [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] drummer [[Eric Singer]], were filmed for a DVD released as ''[[Live at Montreux (Alice Cooper album)|Alice Cooper: Live at Montreux 2005]]'' (2006). One critic, in a review of the Montreux release, commented that Cooper was to be applauded for "still mining pretty much the same territory of teenage angst and rebellion" as he had done more than 30 years previously.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blogcritics.org/dvd-review-live-at-montreux-2005/|title=DVD Review: ''Live At Montreux, 2005'' – Alice Cooper|last=Boyd|first=Glen|date=May 21, 2006|work=Blogcritics|access-date=October 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917034539/https://blogcritics.org/dvd-review-live-at-montreux-2005/|archive-date=September 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2008, Cooper was one of the guest singers on [[Avantasia]]'s third studio album ''[[The Scarecrow (album)|The Scarecrow]]'', singing the seventh track "The Toy Master". In July 2008, after lengthy delays, Cooper released ''[[Along Came a Spider (album)|Along Came a Spider]]'', his eighteenth solo studio album. It was Cooper's highest-charting album since 1991's ''Hey Stoopid'', reaching No. 53 in the US and No. 31 in the UK. The album, visiting similar territory explored in 1987's ''Raise Your Fist and Yell'', deals with the nefarious antics of a deranged [[serial killer]] named "Spider" who is on a quest to use the limbs of his victims to create a human spider. The album generally received positive reviews from music critics, though ''Rolling Stone'' magazine opined that the music on the record sorely missed Bob Ezrin's production values.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/along-came-a-spider-20080812 |title=Alice Cooper: Along Came a Spider |first=Chris |last=Steffen |date=August 12, 2008 |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=August 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225053036/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/along-came-a-spider-20080812 |archive-date=February 25, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The resulting Theatre of Death tour of the album (during which Cooper is executed on four separate occasions) was described in a long November 2009 article about Cooper in ''The Times'' as "epic" and featuring "enough fake blood to remake ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''".{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

==Personal life==
In the early 1970s, a story was widely reported that ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' actor [[Ken Osmond]] had become "rock star Alice Cooper". According to Cooper, the rumor began when a college newspaper editor asked him what kind of child he was, to which Cooper replied, "I was obnoxious, disgusting, a real [[Eddie Haskell]]," referring to the fictional character Osmond portrayed. However, the editor ended up reporting that Cooper was the real Haskell. Cooper later told the ''[[New Times (magazine)|New Times]]'': "It was the biggest rumor that ever came out about me. Finally, I got a T-shirt that said, 'No, I am not Eddie Haskell.' But people still believed it."<ref>Ken Osmond Wiki; Alex Ben Block (January 6, 1975). "Cooper's comedy mocks system". ''[[The Miami News]]''.</ref>

On June 20, 2005, ahead of his June–July 2005 tour, Cooper had a wide-ranging interview with interviewer of celebrities [[Andrew Denton]] for the Australian [[ABC TV (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]]'s ''[[Enough Rope]]''. Cooper discussed various issues during the talk, including the horrors of acute alcoholism and his subsequent cure, being a Christian, and his social and work relationship with his family.<ref name="EnuffRope"/> During the interview, Cooper remarked "I look at [[Mick Jagger]] and he's on an 18-month tour and he's six years older than me, so I figure, when he retires, I have six more years. I will not let him beat me when it comes to longevity."<ref name="EnuffRope"/>

Cooper frequently [[Illeism|refers to himself in the third person as "Alice"]] as a way to distance himself from his stage persona.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

===Marriage and relationships===
In the period when the Alice Cooper group was signed to [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[Straight Records|Straight label]], Miss Christine of [[the GTOs]] became Cooper's girlfriend. Miss Christine (real name Christine Frka), who had recommended Zappa to the group, died on November 5, 1972, of an overdose.<ref group=fn>Cooper describes how he fell for Miss Christine in his autobiography ''Me, Alice'' (1976).</ref> Another long-time girlfriend of Cooper's was Cindy Lang,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thetimesherald/obituary.aspx?pid=183427211 | title=Cynthia Lang Obituary | website=Legacy.com | access-date=February 11, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211131522/http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thetimesherald/obituary.aspx?pid=183427211 | archive-date=February 11, 2018 | url-status=dead}}</ref> with whom he lived for several years.

Cooper and his wife started Solid Rock foundation in 1995. The first of several teen centers opened in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 2012. Another opened in [[Mesa, Arizona]] in 2021. The centers offer vocational and arts training.<ref name=Masley/>

In a 2002 television interview, Cooper stated that he had never cheated on his wife the entire time they had been together. In the same interview, he also said that the secret to a lasting and successful relationship is to continue going out on dates with one's partner.<ref>The [[Johnny Vaughan]] Show, 2002.</ref>

In a 2019 interview, Cooper said that he and his wife Sheryl have a death pact, wherein they will die at the same time, sparking a flurry of headlines.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://jezebel.com/alice-cooper-and-his-wife-have-a-death-pact-1835786692/amp | title=Alice Cooper and His Wife Have a Death Pact | first=Emily | last=Alford | date=June 23, 2019 | website=Jezebel.com | access-date=October 20, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824230558/https://jezebel.com/alice-cooper-and-his-wife-have-a-death-pact-1835786692/amp | archive-date=August 24, 2019 | url-status=live}}</ref> But Cooper clarified his comments, telling ''[[USA Today]]'', "What I was meaning was that because we're almost always together, at home and on the road, that if something did happen to either of us, we'd most likely be together at the time.

===Use of alcohol and other drugs===
Since overcoming his own addiction to alcohol in the mid-1980s, Cooper has continued to help and counsel other rock musicians with addiction problems. "I've made myself very available to friends of mine – they're people who would call me late at night and say, 'Between you and me, I've got a problem.{{'"}}<ref name=Peters>{{cite magazine |last=Peters|first=Mitchell|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045820/alice-cooper-receives-musicares-map-fund-award |title=Alice Cooper Receives MusiCares MAP Fund Award |magazine=Billboard |access-date=August 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703113809/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045820/alice-cooper-receives-musicares-map-fund-award |archive-date=July 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1986, [[thrash metal]] band [[Megadeth]] opened for Cooper on his US ''Constrictor'' tour.

He has stayed close to lead vocalist [[Dave Mustaine]], who considers Cooper to be his "godfather".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/band_timeline.html |title=Megadeth Timeline |work=The Realms of Deth |access-date=April 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209012548/http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/band_timeline.html |archive-date=February 9, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>  In recognition of the work he has done in helping other addicts in the recovery process, Cooper received in 2008 the [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] Award at the fourth annual [[MusiCares|MusiCares MAP Fund benefit concert in Los Angeles]].<ref name=Peters />

===Religion===
During an interview with [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] on [[BBC Radio 2]] in September 2007, Cooper said that he was not a Christian when he gave up drinking, but stated that he thanks God for "taking it away", saying, "I mean if He [God] can [[Crossing the Red Sea|part the Red Sea]] and create the universe, He can certainly take alcoholism away from somebody."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34dnJVdmCzU |title=Alice Cooper Talks to Johnnie Walker about his Christian faith |work=YouTube |date=June 3, 2009 |access-date=March 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708181230/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34dnJVdmCzU |archive-date=July 8, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although he originally did not speak publicly about his religious beliefs, Cooper was later vocal about his faith as a [[Born again|born-again Christian]].<ref name="jesus_journal">{{cite web |url=http://www.jesusjournal.com/content/view/79/85/ |title=Alice Cooper Is A Christian |date=March 28, 2006 |access-date=September 23, 2009 |website=JesusJournal.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101143609/http://www.jesusjournal.com/content/view/79/85/ |archive-date=November 1, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/alice-cooper-religion-saved-article-1.3895181 |title=Legendary rocker Alice Cooper credits Jesus with curing him of alcoholism |date=March 25, 2018 |access-date=March 27, 2018 |website=[[New York Daily News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326020042/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/alice-cooper-religion-saved-article-1.3895181 |archive-date=March 26, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Politics===
Throughout his career, Cooper's philosophy regarding politics is that politics should not be mixed with rock music. Cooper has usually kept his political views to himself, and in 2010 said, "I am extremely non-political. I go out of my way to be non-political. I'm probably the biggest moderate you know. When [[John Lennon]] and [[Harry Nilsson]] used to argue politics, I was sitting right in the middle of them, and I was the guy who was going 'I don't care.' When my parents would start talking politics, I would go in my room and put on [[the Rolling Stones]] or [[the Who]] as long as I could avoid politics. And I still feel that way."<ref name="Rolling Stone"/>

On occasion, Cooper has spoken out against musicians who promote or opine on politics; for example, in the build-up to the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], he told [[The Canadian Press]] that the rock stars campaigning for and touring on behalf of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[John Kerry]] were committing "treason against rock n' roll". He added, upon seeing a list of musicians who supported Kerry, "If I wasn't already a [[George W. Bush|Bush]] supporter, I would have immediately switched. [[Linda Ronstadt]]? [[Don Henley]]? Geez, that's a good reason right there to vote for Bush."<ref name="WP_treason">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27098-2004Aug23.html |date=August 24, 2004 |title=Alice Cooper's Political Makeup |first=Richard |last=Leiby |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=August 15, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724154257/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27098-2004Aug23.html |archive-date=July 24, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref group="fn">On Zimbio's list of [http://www.zimbio.com/Famous+Republicans/articles/GiOVZw1djN-/Alice+Cooper "Famous Republicans"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507014230/http://www.zimbio.com/Famous+Republicans/articles/GiOVZw1djN-/Alice+Cooper |date=May 7, 2012 }} (accessed May 8, 2012), Cooper is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].</ref> In December 2018, Cooper predicted that the next U.S. president would be "worse" than [[Donald Trump]], while arguing that musicians talking politics to their fans was an "abuse of power".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/alice-cooper-next-president-worse-than-trump/ |title=Alice Cooper Predicts Next U.S. President Will Be 'Worse Than Trump' |first=Martin |last=Kielty |website=ultimateclassicrock.com |date=December 30, 2018 |access-date=February 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200217100103/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/alice-cooper-next-president-worse-than-trump/ |archive-date=February 17, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Every four years since releasing his single "Elected" in 1972, Cooper has satirically run for president.<ref name=":1" />

In 2023, Cooper made remarks against the transgender community and suggested women would be sexually assaulted in bathrooms if men were permitted access and called most instances of [[transgender]] identity a "fad", resulting in the loss of a cosmetics branding deal.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Daw |first=Stephen |date=2023-08-23 |title=Alice Cooper Calls Gender-Affirming Care for Trans Kids a 'Fad,' Condemns 'the Whole Woke Thing' |url=https://www.billboard.com/culture/pride/alice-cooper-transgender-healthcare-kids-fad-1235398217/ |access-date=2025-04-07 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Robledo |first=Anthony |title='I find it wrong': Cosmetics brand ends Alice Cooper collection after he called trans people a 'fad' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/08/29/alice-cooper-loses-cosmetics-deal-calling-trans-people-a-fad/70713576007/ |access-date=2025-04-07 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref>

In a 2025 interview with ''[[The Times]]'', Cooper expressed support for [[Donald Trump]], stating that: "(America) got so 'woke' with the [[Joe Biden|Biden]] people, even they thought it was crazy.

===In popular culture===
Cooper, a fan of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', was asked to contribute a storyline for the September 2004 edition of [[Bongo Comics]]'s ''Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror'', a special ''Monsters of Rock'' issue that also included stories plotted by [[Gene Simmons]], [[Rob Zombie]] and [[Pat Boone]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snpp.com/news/pr10_06_04.html |title=Matt Groening's Bongo Comics Presents a Fright-Filled Funfest that Will Rock the Night Away This Halloween |work=The Simpsons Archive |access-date=August 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231657/http://www.snpp.com/news/pr10_06_04.html |archive-date=June 28, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The title of his song "Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me", from ''[[Dragontown]]'', is a reference to the series.

In October 1979, Cooper was featured in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'', Volume 1, Number 50 loosely adapting his ''[[From the Inside (Alice Cooper album)|From the Inside]]'' studio album.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dynamite-launch-alice-cooper-comic-713132 |title=Dynamite to Launch 'Alice Cooper' Comic Book Series in September |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 19, 2014 |access-date=June 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617061222/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dynamite-launch-alice-cooper-comic-713132 |archive-date=June 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Marvel Premiere">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/alice-cooper-launches-new-comic-series/|title=Alice Cooper Launches New Comic Series|work=[[The Beat (comics magazine)|The Beat]]|date=July 17, 2013|access-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617081800/http://www.comicsbeat.com/alice-cooper-launches-new-comic-series/|archive-date=June 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Cooper is also the subject of the "We're not worthy" meme, which was popularized during his cameo in ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' with [[Mike Myers]] and [[Dana Carvey]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://amp.timeinc.net/nme/news/music/alice-cooper-reflects-legendary-waynes-world-scene-25-years-later-1970567?source=dam|title=Alice Cooper reflects on legendary 'Wayne's World' scene 25 years later|website=Amp.timeinc.net|access-date=September 16, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622083955/http://amp.timeinc.net/nme/news/music/alice-cooper-reflects-legendary-waynes-world-scene-25-years-later-1970567?source=dam|archive-date=June 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Cooper contributed his likeness and over 700 voice lines to Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, a [[pinball]] machine released in 2018 by Spooky Pinball that also features ten songs performed by Cooper. Only 500 machines were made.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2018/03/18/alice-coopers-nightmare-castle/|title=ALICE COOPER'S NIGHTMARE CASTLE|website=Pinballnews.com|date=March 18, 2018|access-date=May 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528135205/https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2018/03/18/alice-coopers-nightmare-castle/|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
