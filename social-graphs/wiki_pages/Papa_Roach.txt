'''Papa Roach''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Vacaville, California]], formed in 1993. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist [[Jacoby Shaddix]], drummer Dave Buckner, guitarist [[Jerry Horton]], bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther.

After releasing two EPs, James departed and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two additional EPs before signing with [[DreamWorks Records]] in 1999, subsequently releasing the triple-platinum ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' in 2000, the gold album ''[[Lovehatetragedy]]'' in 2002, and the platinum album ''[[Getting Away with Murder (album)|Getting Away with Murder]]'' in 2004. Following the release of ''[[The Paramour Sessions]]'' in 2006, Buckner left the band in 2007 and was succeeded by [[Tony Palermo]]. Papa Roach then released ''[[Metamorphosis (Papa Roach album)|Metamorphosis]]'' (2009), ''[[Time for Annihilation]]'' (2010), ''[[The Connection (Papa Roach album)|The Connection]]'' (2012), ''[[F.E.A.R. (Papa Roach album)|F.E.A.R.]]'' (2015), ''[[Crooked Teeth (album)|Crooked Teeth]]'' (2017), and ''[[Who Do You Trust? (album)|Who Do You Trust?]]'' (2019). The group's eleventh studio album, ''[[Ego Trip (Papa Roach album)|Ego Trip]]'', was released in 2022.

==History==

===Early years (1993–1995)===
Papa Roach's formation began in January 1993 when lead singer [[Jacoby Shaddix]] and drummer Dave Buckner met on the [[Vacaville High School]] football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist [[Jerry Horton]] from nearby [[Vanden High School]], rhythm guitarist Anne Mikolajcik, trombonist Ben Luther, and bassist Will James.<ref>{{cite news |last=McLaughlin |first=David |title=How Infest Made Papa Roach Superstars |url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/how-infest-made-papa-roach-superstars/ |work=Kerrang! |date=April 25, 2019 |access-date=April 16, 2022 |archive-date=October 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025073120/https://www.kerrang.com/features/how-infest-made-papa-roach-superstars/ |url-status=live }}</ref> They decided to enter the school's talent show, performing a rendition of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s song "[[Fire (The Jimi Hendrix Experience song)|Fire]]". Ultimately, they did not win the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band, followed by Anne Mikolajcik. During this period, Papa Roach practiced daily and toured extensively, playing every gig they could secure. The band's first tour van was named Moby Dick, which inspired Shaddix to adopt his initial stage name, "Coby Dick." Initially, the band was called "Papa Gato," as suggested by Buckner, but Shaddix changed it to Papa Roach, combining the nickname of his maternal grandfather, Herbert Fischer "Papa," with "Roach," derived from his paternal grandfather, John "Grandpa" Roatch. Both grandparents were musicians.<ref>{{cite web |title=Have you ever wonder how Papa Roach got name their name? |url=https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuZz-f-vJpp/?igshid=OGIzYTJhMTRmYQ== |website=Instagram |date=June 7, 2023 |access-date=June 13, 2023 |language=en-US |archive-date=July 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230713210808/https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuZz-f-vJpp/?igshid=OGIzYTJhMTRmYQ== |url-status=live }}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2024}}</ref>

In 1994, Papa Roach released its first [[Extended play|EP]], titled ''[[Potatoes for Christmas]]''. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown while he spent the year in [[Seattle]], studying art. In 1995, the band released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled ''Caca Bonita''. By this time, Buckner had returned. In 1996, the group replaced original bassist Will James with longtime roadie Tobin Esperance, as James' involvement in a church summer camp limited the band's summer rehearsals and touring.

===''Old Friends from Young Years'' and record deal (1996–1999)===
{{main|Old Friends from Young Years}}  
On February 4, 1997, the band's debut studio album, titled ''[[Old Friends from Young Years]]'', was released. At this time, the group was actively touring, supporting bands such as [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Powerman 5000]], [[Hed PE]], [[Snot (band)|Snot]], [[Far (band)|Far]], and [[Static-X]].

In 1998, Papa Roach released an EP titled ''[[5 Tracks Deep]]'', which sold more than 1,000 copies within its first month of release. In 1999, the band produced another EP, their final independent release, titled ''[[Let 'Em Know]]''. Its success attracted the attention of [[Warner Music Group]], which, as part of a development deal, provided a modest amount of funding for the production of a five-track promotional demo CD.<ref name="hitquarters.com">[http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Jay_Baumgardner_Interview.html "Interview With Jay Baumgardner"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017122140/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Jay_Baumgardner_Interview.html |date=October 17, 2012}}, ''[[HitQuarters]]'', April 25, 2005.</ref> The band sought out influential rock producer [[Jay Baumgardner]] to produce the record.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Baumgardner stated, "At first, I wasn't really convinced it would work out, but then I saw a video of them performing at a club – I saw all these kids going wild, knowing the songs by heart – and that's when I realized that they definitely had potential."<ref name="hitquarters.com"/>

Warner Bros. was unimpressed with the demo and chose not to sign the group.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> The unreleased disc included the tracks "Infest," "[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]," "[[Broken Home (Papa Roach song)|Broken Home]]," "Dead Cell," and "[[She Loves Me Not (song)|She Loves Me Not]]".

Shortly thereafter, [[DreamWorks Records]] offered the band a recording contract.

On October 10, 2006, a [[The String Quartet Tribute|String Quartet]] [[tribute album]] titled ''Perfect Murder: Strung Out on Papa Roach'' was released by [[Vitamin Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vitaminrecords.com/web/page.asp?pgs=product&catid=20&id=1119|title=Strung Out on a Papa Roach: A String Quartet Tribute|publisher=vitaminrecords.com|access-date=March 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119215927/http://www.vitaminrecords.com/web/page.asp?pgs=product&catid=20&id=1119|archive-date=November 19, 2008}}</ref>

The band initially planned to release a compilation of acoustic recordings of their songs, including "Forever," "[[Scars (Papa Roach song)|Scars]]," and "Not Coming Home," which was recorded for [[KROQ-FM]]'s charity Christmas album, ''Kevin and Bean's Super Christmas''. However, the acoustic compilation was later shelved. In an interview with Billboard, Shaddix expressed his belief that fans were not yet ready for an acoustic direction from the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1055044/papa-roach-going-acoustic-just-not-yet|title=Papa Roach Going Acoustic, Just Not Yet|publisher=billboard.com|access-date=March 5, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610170926/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1055044/papa-roach-going-acoustic-just-not-yet|archive-date=June 10, 2013}}</ref>

On April 25, 2007, it was announced that drummer Dave Buckner would be sitting out the band's touring schedule due to personal matters, with expectations for him to rejoin the group shortly thereafter. Shaddix later confirmed in an interview with Launch Radio Networks that Dave had entered rehab to "go clean his act up 'cause he was out of his mind." [[Unwritten Law]] drummer [[Tony Palermo]] filled in on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=71529|title=PAPA ROACH Drummer Checks Into Rehab|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606103048/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=71529|archive-date=June 6, 2011}}</ref>

In the summer of 2007, the band went on the Bad Boys of Rock tour, supporting [[Hinder]]. During this tour, frontman Shaddix and Hinder lead singer [[Austin Winkler]] developed a strong friendship, leading to the band touring with [[Hinder]] on multiple occasions in subsequent years. It was revealed in 2015 that Shaddix and Austin wrote and recorded a song together for part of Winkler's solo project, although both expressed uncertainty about whether the song would ever be released.<ref>{{cite web|title=On the Line with Austin Winkler|author=Alex Obert|url=http://journeyofafrontman.com/2015/06/21/on-the-line-with-austin-winkler/|work=Journey of a Frontman|date=June 21, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708181607/http://journeyofafrontman.com/2015/06/21/on-the-line-with-austin-winkler/|archive-date=July 8, 2015}}</ref>

In 2008, it was announced that the band would officially part ways with drummer Dave Buckner. It was also revealed that Buckner had sued the band, claiming he wasn't "receiving his fair share of the group's earnings."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/video-papa-roach-rejoined-by-drummer-dave-buckner-for-last-resort-performance|title=Video: Papa Roach Rejoined By Drummer Dave Buckner For 'Last Resort' Performance|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 23, 2013|access-date=September 4, 2023|archive-date=September 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230905020114/https://blabbermouth.net/news/video-papa-roach-rejoined-by-drummer-dave-buckner-for-last-resort-performance|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Main|Metamorphosis (Papa Roach album)}}
In an interview in February 2008 with [[WRKZ|99.7 The Blitz]], Shaddix stated that the band was working on their next album, initially titled ''Days of War, Nights of Love''. However, the album was later renamed to ''[[Metamorphosis (Papa Roach album)|Metamorphosis]]'' to commemorate the band's tenth anniversary of signing with [[DreamWorks Records]] in 1999 and to reflect the various changes the band had experienced during that time.

On April 15, Papa Roach announced they would be touring as part of [[Mötley Crüe]]'s ''[[Crüe Fest]]'', alongside [[Buckcherry]], [[Sixx:A.M.]], and [[Trapt]]. The tour commenced on July 1 in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/the-blender/the-blender/2008/04/concert-announcement-cruefest-with-motley-crue/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20090623014330/http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/the-blender/the-blender/2008/04/concert-announcement-cruefest-with-motley-crue/|archive-date=June 23, 2009|title=Concert Announcement: Cruefest with Motley Crue|publisher=stl-today.com|access-date=March 5, 2010}}</ref> The release date for the album was confirmed as August 26 during ''Crüe Fest''.

Later in the year, the band also toured with [[Seether]], [[Staind]], and [[Red (band)|Red]]. During this tour, the release date for ''Metamorphosis'' was changed to March 24, 2009.

On October 26, Papa Roach released the music video for the song "[[Hollywood Whore (Papa Roach song)|Hollywood Whore]]", which was also released as an [[Hollywood Whore EP|EP in Canada]] and as a digital single on October 28. The album's first official single, "[[Lifeline (Papa Roach song)|Lifeline]]", was made available on the band's [[MySpace]] profile on January 9, 2009. Additionally, the band toured with [[Buckcherry]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]], and [[Burn Halo]] in early 2009. The ''Crüe Fest'' DVD was released on March 24, coinciding with the release of ''Metamorphosis''. The second single, "[[I Almost Told You That I Loved You]]", was released on June 1. On June 23, they released their ninth EP, ''[[Naked and Fearless: Acoustic EP]]'', which became available through the [[Zune Marketplace]], [[iTunes]], and [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]].

"Metamorphosis" reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 8, marking the band's first top ten album since 2002.<ref>"The Hot Box." Billboard 121.14 (2009): 33. Music Index. Web. February 19, 2015.</ref>

Papa Roach toured with [[Nickelback]] on their [[Dark Horse Tour]], performing at [[Live Nation]] outdoor amphitheaters alongside [[Hinder]] and [[Saving Abel]] during the summer, as well as with [[Breaking Benjamin]].

"Lifeline" was nominated for [[Fuse TV]]'s Best Video of 2009 contest, surpassing [[Metallica]]'s "[[All Nightmare Long]]", [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]]'s "[[No Surprise (Daughtry song)|No Surprise]]", [[Shinedown]]'s "[[Sound of Madness (song)|Sound of Madness]]", and [[Paramore]]'s "[[Ignorance (song)|Ignorance]]".

In a separate interview with Upvenue, bassist Tobin Esperance commented on ''Time for Annihilation,'' stating, "We put out five major label, full-length records, and we were transitioning from a major label to going independent. We wanted to do something different [...] we'd always talked about doing a live record, and it turned into 'let's add a couple of bonus songs' [...] and now it's half live, half new songs and it's kind of the past and present of Papa Roach.

Shaddix has added this remark in another interview: "We're a band that tries to walk that line between [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[post-hardcore|hardcore]], [[punk rock]] and [[pop music]], and we do our best at trying to make it all cool".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paparoach.com/bio/|title=Papa Roach: Biography|publisher=paparoach.com|access-date=March 5, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309121308/http://www.paparoach.com/bio|archive-date=March 9, 2010}}</ref>

Prior to the release of [[The Connection (Papa Roach album)|''The Connection'']], guitarist Jerry Horton said in an interview by VerdamMnis Magazine that "It's kind of a natural thing for us, we've always been changing throughout the years. Of course, there are some things that stay the same in our sound but we do like to try new things to sort of stretch out a little bit our basis and therefore make it more interesting". He also said that the band was going to explore "electronic sounds for the next record".<ref name="Papa Roach : Interview 2010 / 2011"/>

The band's influences include [[Faith No More]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Metallica]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Fugees]], [[Refused]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref name=ShaddixSongfacts>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/jacoby_shaddix_of_papa_roach/ |title=Jacoby Shaddix of Papa Roach |website=Songfacts.com |date=April 12, 2015 |last=Prato |first=Greg |access-date=October 22, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20171207121006/http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/jacoby_shaddix_of_papa_roach/ |archive-date=December 7, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/tobin_esperance_of_papa_roach/ |title=Tobin Esperance of Papa Roach |publisher=Songfacts |date=September 14, 2011 |last=MacIntosh |first=Dan |access-date=October 22, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701094358/http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/tobin_esperance_of_papa_roach/ |archive-date=July 1, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/papa-roachs-new-album-to-feature-guest-appearances-by-machine-gun-kelly-skylar-grey/|title=PAPA ROACH's New Album To Feature Guest Appearances By MACHINE GUN KELLY, SKYLAR GREY|date=March 7, 2017|access-date=January 24, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023063758/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/papa-roachs-new-album-to-feature-guest-appearances-by-machine-gun-kelly-skylar-grey/|archive-date=October 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=December 7, 2017|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2010/12/27/papa-roach-guitarist-jerry-horton/|title=PAPA ROACH – guitarist Jerry Horton|publication-date=December 27, 2010|date=November 15, 2010|first1=Marko|last1=Syrjälä|first2=Ville|last2=Ruso|location=Helsinki, Finland|website=[[Metal Rules]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171128031218/http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2010/12/27/papa-roach-guitarist-jerry-horton/|archive-date=November 28, 2017}}</ref> Jacoby Shaddix cites Faith No More's [[Mike Patton]] and Social Distortion's [[Mike Ness]] as significant influences, stating, "The way that I sing, I definitely was inspired by Mike Patton, but I appreciate the storytelling that Mike Ness does. I kind of fused those two influences together at an early age, and it inspired me to become my own thing."<ref name=ShaddixSongfacts />

Initially, Papa Roach's most significant influence was the experimental band [[Mr. Bungle]], fronted by Mike Patton of Faith No More. This influence is evident in the adventurous nature of their 1994 debut release, ''[[Potatoes for Christmas]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Gavin|last=Lloyd|date=February 4, 2015|title=The A-Z Of Papa Roach|magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-a-to-z-of-papa-roach|access-date=March 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403225804/https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-a-to-z-of-papa-roach|archive-date=April 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a 2021 interview, [[Jacoby Shaddix]] reflected on the band's longstanding association with the [[nu metal]] genre, stating, "I love being one of the forefathers of nu metal, that's dope, but we've been able to outlive it and celebrate it at the same time."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-05|title=Papa Roach's Jacoby Shaddix: "I Love Being One of the Forefathers of Nu Metal, That's F**king Dope"|url=https://www.wearethepit.com/2021/03/papa-roachs-jacoby-shaddix-i-love-being-one-of-the-forefathers-of-nu-metal-thats-fking-dope/|access-date=2021-09-27|website=The Pit|language=en-US|archive-date=June 5, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230605024241/https://www.wearethepit.com/2021/03/papa-roachs-jacoby-shaddix-i-love-being-one-of-the-forefathers-of-nu-metal-thats-fking-dope/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Papa Roach is regarded as one of the bands that helped define the nu metal sound. [[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]] stated: "Despite distancing themselves from their distinctive sound in recent years, Papa Roach's early output shaped the aspect of nü metal that the mainstream embraced with open arms—riff-laden, radio-friendly (at least, after a few bleeps) singles with dark, earworm lyrics designed to upset parents. Jacoby Shaddix's in-your-face tones introduced many teenagers to their nü-metal awakening, supported by completely singable and seductive guitar lines that made this outfit so instrumental in the genre. So much so that a feature from Shaddix serves as a seal of approval for any album."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-07-21 |title=20 artists who defined the sound of nü metal from past to present |url=https://www.altpress.com/features/bands-who-influenced-nu-metal/ |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=Alternative Press Magazine |language=en |archive-date=April 14, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220414232934/https://www.altpress.com/features/bands-who-influenced-nu-metal/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Regarding the band's album "Infest," [[Kerrang!]] magazine remarked: "Straining vocal cords and detonating dancefloors with 'Last Resort,' tugging the heartstrings with 'Broken Home,' and embedding themselves under our skin with 'Between Angels And Insects,' Jacoby Shaddix's Californian group didn't just deliver an overload of angst—they unleashed every ounce of emotion through arguably the catchiest songwriting nu metal would ever see. Adolescence never truly ends, and even now, these are absolutely essential sounds."<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 21 greatest nu-metal albums of all time – ranked |url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-21-greatest-nu-metal-albums-of-all-time-definitively-ranked |access-date=2022-03-15 |website=Kerrang! |date=June 17, 2020 |language=en |archive-date=January 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220113093057/https://www.kerrang.com/the-21-greatest-nu-metal-albums-of-all-time-definitively-ranked |url-status=live }}</ref>
