The<!--- WP:THE policy: "If a band is officially known without a definite article, but the members typically refer to their group as "the (Name)" in everyday speech, then the definite article should be included in running prose."" ---> '''Pixies''' are an American [[alternative rock]] band from [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], formed in 1986 by [[Black Francis]] (vocals, rhythm guitar, songwriter), [[Joey Santiago]] (lead guitar), [[Kim Deal]] (bass, vocals) and [[David Lovering]] (drums).

The Pixies are associated with the 1990s [[alternative rock]] boom, and draw on elements including [[punk rock]] and [[surf music|surf rock]]. Their music is known for dynamic "loud-quiet-loud" shifts and song structures. Francis is the primary songwriter; his often surreal lyrics cover offbeat subjects such as extraterrestrials, incest, and biblical violence. Their jarring pop sound influenced acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Radiohead]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] and [[Weezer]].

The Pixies achieved modest popularity in the US but were more successful in Europe. Their popularity grew after their breakup, leading to a 2004 reunion and sold-out world tours. Deal left in 2012, and was replaced by [[Kim Shattuck]] for their 2013 tour. She was later replaced by [[Paz Lenchantin]], who became a full member in 2016. With Lenchantin, the Pixies recorded the albums ''[[Head Carrier]]'' (2016), ''[[Beneath the Eyrie]]'' (2019) and ''[[Doggerel (album)|Doggerel]]'' (2022). Lenchantin departed in 2024, replaced by Emma Richardson, formerly of [[Band of Skulls]]. The ninth <!--not including Come On Pilgrim which is a mini-album-->Pixies album, ''[[The Night the Zombies Came]],'' was released in October 2024.

== History ==

=== Formation (1984–1986) ===
[[File:BlackFrancisTroxy.jpg|thumb|Founding member and principal songwriter [[Black Francis]]]]Guitarist [[Joey Santiago]] and songwriter [[Black Francis]] (born Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV) met in 1984 when they lived next to each other in a suite while attending the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies">{{harvnb|Spitz|2004}}</ref> Although Santiago was worried about distractions, he noticed Francis played music and the pair began to jam together.<ref name=ganz>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=11}}</ref> Francis embarked on a student exchange trip to Puerto Rico to study Spanish.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university.<ref name=sisario>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=12–13}}</ref> Francis and Santiago spent the year working in a Boston-area warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train.<ref name=ganz2>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=13}}</ref>

The pair formed a band in January 1986.<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{harvnb|Erlewine (Pixies Biography)}}</ref> Two weeks later, Francis placed an advertisement seeking a bass player who liked both the folk act [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] and the alternative rock band [[Hüsker Dü]].<ref name=ganz3>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|pp=13–14}}</ref> [[Kim Deal]] was the only respondent, and arrived at the audition without a bass, as she had never played one before.<ref name=ganz4>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=15}}</ref><ref name=sisario2>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=14}}</ref> She was invited to join as she liked the songs Francis showed her. She obtained a bass, and the trio started rehearsing in Deal's apartment.<ref name="Frank|Ganz|2005|p=20">{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=20}}</ref>

After recruiting Deal, Kim paid for her sister, [[Kelley Deal]], to fly to Boston and audition as drummer. Though Francis approved, Kelley was not confident in her drumming, and was more interested in playing songs written by Kim; she later joined Kim's band the [[The Breeders|Breeders]].<ref name=Chick>{{harvnb|Chick|2008}}</ref> Kim's husband suggested they hire [[David Lovering]], whom Kim had met at her wedding reception.<ref name=ganz6>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=18}}</ref><ref name=sisario3>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=8–9}}</ref> The group arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word "[[pixie]]s" randomly from a dictionary, liking how it looked and its definition as "mischievous little [[elves]]".<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> The Pixies moved rehearsals to Lovering's parents' garage in mid-1986<ref name="Frank|Ganz|2005|p=20" /> and began to play shows at bars in the Boston area.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" />

=== ''Come On Pilgrim'' (1987) ===
While the Pixies were playing a concert with [[Throwing Muses]], they were noticed by the producer [[Gary Smith (record producer)|Gary Smith]], the manager of [[Fort Apache Studios]].<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> He told them he "could not sleep until you guys are world famous".<ref name="officialprofile">{{harvnb|Pixies (4AD)}}</ref>  Funded by Francis' father at the cost of $1000, the Pixies spent three days recording a 17-track demo at Fort Apache, known as the [[Pixies (EP)|''Purple Tape'']] for its purple cover.<ref name="Sisario, 2006. p. 16">{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=16}}</ref> The promoter Ken Goes became the Pixies' manager, and he passed the demo to [[Ivo Watts-Russell]] of the independent record label [[4AD]].<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> Watts-Russell found the Pixies too normal and "too rock 'n' roll", but signed them at the persuasion of his girlfriend.<ref name=sisario5>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=17}}</ref>

Upon signing with 4AD, eight tracks from the Purple Tape were selected for the ''[[Come On Pilgrim]]'' mini-LP, the Pixies' first release.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> Francis drew upon his experiences in Puerto Rico, mostly in the songs "Vamos" and "Isla de Encanta", describing the poverty in Puerto Rico and singing in loose Spanish.<ref name="officialprofile"/> The religious lyrics and later albums came from his parents' [[born-again Christian]] days in the Pentecostal Church.<ref name="officialprofile"/> The critic Heather Phares identified themes such as sexual frustration ("I've Been Tired") and incest ("Nimrod's Son" and "The Holiday Song").<ref>{{harvnb|Phares (Come On Pilgrim)}}</ref>

=== ''Surfer Rosa'' and ''Doolittle'' (1988–1989) ===
''Come On Pilgrim'' was followed by the Pixies' first full-length album, ''[[Surfer Rosa]]''. It was recorded by [[Steve Albini]],<ref name=ganz7>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=75}}</ref> completed in two weeks, and released in early 1988.<ref name="officialprofile"/> ''Surfer Rosa'' gained the Pixies acclaim in Europe; both ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' named it their "Album of the Year". American critical response was positive but more muted, a reaction that persisted for much of the Pixies' career.<ref name=sisario6>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=19–20}}</ref> ''Surfer Rosa'' was eventually [[Music recording certification|certified gold]] in the US in 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|50 Cent Cashes In}}</ref> The Pixies arrived in England to support Throwing Muses on the European "Sex and Death" tour, beginning at the [[Mean Fiddler]] in London.<ref name=ganz8>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=94}}</ref> The tour also took them to the Netherlands, where the Pixies had already received enough media attention to be headlining the tour.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

The Pixies signed an American distribution deal with the major record label [[Elektra Records|Elektra]].<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> Around this time, they struck up a relationship with the British producer [[Gil Norton]]. Norton produced their second full album, ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'',<ref name=carew>{{harvnb|Carew}}</ref> which was recorded in the last six weeks of 1988 and seen as a departure from the raw sound of ''Come On Pilgrim'' and ''Surfer Rosa''. ''Doolittle'' had a much cleaner sound, largely due to Norton and the production budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]40,000, which was quadruple that of ''Surfer Rosa''.<ref name=sisario7>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=47}}</ref> ''Doolittle'' featured the single "[[Here Comes Your Man]]", which biographers Josh Frank and Caryn Ganz describe as an unusually jaunty and pop-like song for the band.<ref name=ganz9>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|pp=118–9}}</ref> "[[Monkey Gone to Heaven]]" was popular on alternative rock radio in the US, reaching the top 10 on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Airplay|Modern Rock Tracks]],<ref>{{harvnb|Pixies: Awards}}</ref> and the single entered the Top 100 in the U.K.<ref>{{harvnb|Roach|2008|p=320}}</ref> Like ''Surfer Rosa'', ''Doolittle'' was acclaimed by fans and music critics alike.<ref name="carew" /> ''Doolittle'' was their first album to enter into the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at 98.<ref>{{harvnb|Pixies Chart History – Billboard 200}}</ref> In the UK, the album was a commercial success, reaching number 8 in the [[UK Albums Chart|Albums Chart]].<ref name="UK Chart">{{harvnb|Pixies full Official Chart history}}</ref>

=== Break (1989–1990) ===
After ''Doolittle'', tensions between Deal and Francis came to a head (for example, Francis threw a guitar at Deal during a concert in [[Stuttgart]]),<ref name=ganz10>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=132}}</ref> and Deal was almost fired from the band when she refused to play at a concert in [[Frankfurt]].<ref name=aston>{{harvnb|Aston|1997}}</ref> Santiago, in an interview with ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', described Deal as being "headstrong and want[ing] to include her own songs, to explore her own world" on the band's albums; eventually she accepted that Francis was the singer and had musical control of the band, but after the Frankfurt incident, "they kinda stopped talking".<ref name=aston/> The band became increasingly tired during the post-''Doolittle'' "Fuck or Fight" tour of the United States and fighting among members continued.<ref name=carew/> After the tour's final date in New York City, the band was too exhausted to attend the end-of-tour party the following night and soon announced a hiatus.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

During this time, Santiago and Lovering went on vacation<ref name=carew/> while Francis performed a short solo tour,<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> made up of a number of concerts to generate gas money as he traveled across the country.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> Deal formed a new band, [[the Breeders]], with [[Tanya Donelly]] of [[Throwing Muses]] and bass player [[Josephine Wiggs]] of Perfect Disaster.<ref name=breedersbiography>{{harvnb|Erlewine (Breeders Biography)}}</ref> Their debut album, ''[[Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod]]'', was released in 1990.<ref name=breedersbiography/><ref>{{harvnb|Phares (Pod)}}</ref>

=== ''Bossanova'' and ''Trompe le Monde'' (1990–1992) ===
[[File:PixiesTicket1990.jpg|thumb|A Pixies ticket from October 1, 1990]]In 1990, all members of the group except Deal moved to Los Angeles.<ref name=ganz12>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=172}}</ref> Lovering stated that he, Santiago, and Francis moved there "because the recording studio was there".<ref name=ganz13>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=74}}</ref> Unlike previous recordings, the band had little time to practice beforehand, and Black Francis wrote much of the album in the studio.<ref name=ganz14>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|pp=175–76}}</ref> Featuring the singles "[[Velouria]]" and "[[Dig for Fire]]", ''[[Bossanova (Pixies album)|Bossanova]]'' reached number 70 in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Billboard 200: Week of September 15, 1990}}</ref> In contrast, the album peaked at number three in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{harvnb|Roach|2009|p=216}}</ref> Also in 1990, the Pixies released a cover of the [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band's]] "Born in Chicago" on the compilation album ''[[Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary]]''.<ref name=allmu3>{{harvnb|Heilman}}</ref>

The band continued to tour and released ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'' in 1991, their final album before their break-up. The album included "U-Mass", which has been described as being about college apathy,<ref name=magnet>{{harvnb|Fritch|2001}}</ref> and whose guitar riff was written years before at the University of Massachusetts before Francis and Santiago dropped out.<ref name=magnet/> The album also featured a cover of "[[Head On (song)|Head On]]" by [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]].<ref>{{harvnb|Phares (Trompe le Monde)}}</ref> Also that year, the band contributed a cover of "I Can't Forget" to the [[Leonard Cohen]] [[tribute album]] ''[[I'm Your Fan]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Erlewine (I'm Your Fan)}}</ref> and began an international tour on which they played stadiums in Europe and smaller venues in the United States. In 1992, they supported [[U2]] on the lucrative US leg of their [[Zoo TV Tour]].<ref name=barton/> Their final performance took place om April 25, 1992 at the [[Commodore Ballroom]] in Vancouver, British Columbia.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://tinnitist.com/2025/04/24/area-residents-stylus-counsel-reunited-it-feels-so/ | title=Area Resident’s Stylus Counsel – Reunited (& It Feels So…) |website=tinnitist.com | access-date=September 20, 2025 | date=April 24, 2025}}</ref> Tensions rose among band members, and they went on sabbatical and focused on separate projects.<ref name=barton>{{harvnb|Barton|2005}}</ref> 

=== Breakup and solo projects (1993–2003) ===
In early 1993, Francis announced in an interview with [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] that the Pixies were finished, without telling the other members of the band. He offered no explanation at the time.<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> He later called Santiago and notified Deal and Lovering via [[fax]].<ref name=sisario8>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=7}}</ref>

After the breakup, the members embarked on separate projects. Black Francis renamed himself Frank Black,<ref>{{harvnb|Erlewine (Frank Black Biography)}}</ref> and released several solo albums, including a string of releases with [[Frank Black and the Catholics]].<ref name="fbatcr">{{harvnb|Frank Black and the Catholics: Releases}}</ref> Deal returned to the Breeders, who achieved a hit single, "[[Cannonball (Breeders song)|Cannonball]]", from their platinum-selling ''[[Last Splash]]'' in 1993, and released more albums several years later.<ref name="breedersbiography" /> She also formed [[the Amps]], who released one album.<ref name="village">{{harvnb|Grose|2002}}</ref>

[[File:Pixies2009.jpg|thumb|right|The Pixies in 2009]]
In the years following the Pixies' breakup, Black dismissed rumors of a reunion,<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /><ref name=magnet/><ref>{{harvnb|Frank Blacks Out Pixies Reunion}}</ref> but incorporated an increasing number of Pixies songs in his sets with the Catholics,<ref name=mendel>{{harvnb|Mendelssohn|2005|pp=152, 168, 191}}</ref> and occasionally included Santiago in his solo work and Lovering's magic show as an opening act to concerts.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> In 2003, a series of phone calls among band members resulted in some low-key rehearsals, and soon the decision to reunite.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> By February 2004, a full tour was announced,<ref>{{harvnb|Pixies to Reunite for Tour – Official!}}</ref> and tickets for nearly all the initial tour dates sold out within minutes.<ref>{{harvnb|Pixies sell out!}}</ref>

The Pixies played their first reunion concert on April 13, 2004, at the Fine Line Music Cafe in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lash|2005}}</ref> A warm-up tour through the U.S. and Canada (in which all dates were recorded and released as individual limited-edition CDs) was followed by an appearance at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].<ref name="allmusic-bio"/><ref>{{harvnb|Moss|2004}}</ref> The band toured Europe in the spring and summer of 2004, beginning on 26 May in [[Reykjavik]] and concluding on 22 August in [[Chelmsford]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/sizzling-sales-for-pixies-summer-euro-tour-1441387/|title=Sizzling Sales For Pixies Summer Euro Tour|first=Ray|last=Waddell|date=March 24, 2004}}</ref> The group won the Act-of-the-Year award in the 2004 ''Boston Music Awards''.<ref>{{harvnb|Boston Music Awards 2004}}</ref> The 2004 reunion tour grossed over $14&nbsp;million in ticket sales.<ref>{{harvnb|Kot|2004}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' would later credit the band for ushering in "the indie-icon reunion-tour circuit ... a long overdue opportunity to play for the sort of massive crowds that their famous fans—[[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Radiohead]], and [[Weezer]] among them—had built on their influence."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22437-head-carrier/|title=Pixies: Head Carrier|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=October 6, 2016|access-date=October 1, 2016|last=Berman|first=Stuart}}</ref>

===Lenchantin's departure, arrival of Richardson and ''The Night the Zombies Came'' (2024–present)===
On 4 March 2024, the Pixies announced that Lenchantin had left "to concentrate on her own projects".<ref name=":0" /> In a statement to ''Rolling Stone'', Lenchantin said that the choice was not hers and that her "departure [was] a bit of a surprise to [her] as it is to many".<ref name=":0" /> She was replaced on the following tour by Emma Richardson, formerly of [[Band of Skulls]].<ref name=":0" /> The tour celebrated the Pixies' third and fourth albums, [[Bossanova (Pixies album)|''Bossanova'']] (1990) and ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'' (1991), with Francis describing it as "delightful".<ref name="RollingStoneZombies">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/pixies-the-night-the-zombies-came-album-1235065123/|title=The Pixies Battle the Undead and Welcome Their Latest Bass Player on New 'Zombies' Album|website=[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]|last=Greene|first=Andy|date=July 24, 2024|access-date=July 24, 2024}}</ref> In June, the Pixies released the single "You're So Impatient", Richardson's first studio credit with the band.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-06-03 |title=Pixies Share New Song "You're So Impatient" & Cover Doris Day's "Que Sera, Sera": Listen |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2266171/pixies-youre-so-impatient-que-sera-sera-doris-day-cover/music/ |access-date=2024-07-22 |website=Stereogum |language=en}}</ref>

On October 25, 2024, the Pixies released their ninth full-length studio album, ''[[The Night the Zombies Came]]'', produced by [[Tom Dalgety]], who also worked on their previous three studio albums.<ref name="RollingStoneZombies"/> Regarding the title, Francis said: "It's not like I wrote a bunch of songs about zombies or that we tried to make the album sound scary or anything like that. 'Zombie' is just an associative word. You can do with it what you like. And it's not a concept record, but that word kept popping up in the lyrics. When I combed through all the other lyrics for a title, they just sounded corny as shit. The only thing that made sense was ''The Night the Zombies Came''. And I was like, 'You know what? That's a pretty good title. I'd go see that movie.'"<ref name="RollingStoneZombies"/> The album was preceded by the singles "You're So Impatient", "Chicken", "Oyster Beds" and "Motoroller".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kelly |first1=Tyler |title=Pixies have announced their tenth studio album, The Night the Zombies Came, alongside the lead single "Chicken". |url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/pixies-announce-forthcoming-album-the-night-the-zombies-came |website=The Line of Best Fit |access-date=24 July 2024}}</ref>

== Style ==

=== Music ===
The Pixies incorporate elements of [[Surf music|surf rock]] and [[punk rock]], with an emphasis on contrasting volume dynamics. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' described them as "surf music-meets-[[The Stooges|Stooges]] spikiness and oft-imitated stop/start and quiet/loud dynamics".<ref>{{harvnb|Cohen|2002|p=36}}</ref> Their music was described as "an unorthodox marriage of surf music and punk rock ... characterized by Black's bristling lyrics and hackle-raising caterwaul, Deal's whispered harmonies and waspy basslines, Joey Santiago's fragile guitar, and the persistent flush of David Lovering's drums."<ref name=barton />

The music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts. Francis said in 1991, "Those are the two basic components of rock music&nbsp;... the dreamy side and the rockin' side. It's always been either sweaty or laid back and cool. We do try to be dynamic, but it's dumbo dynamics, because we don't know how to do anything else. We can play loud or quiet—that's it."<ref name="Guitar Player">{{cite book |title=The Pixies: Gods of Almost Pop. April |first=Joe |last=Gore |year=1991 |publisher=Guitar Player }}</ref>

=== Influences ===
The Pixies are influenced by a range of artists and genres; each member came from a different musical background. When he first started writing songs for the Pixies, Francis says he was listening to nothing but [[Hüsker Dü]], [[Captain Beefheart]], and [[Iggy Pop]];<ref name=sisario9>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=13}}</ref> whilst in the run up to recording ''Come On Pilgrim'' he listened to [[R.E.M.]]'s ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' a lot, which he described as "hugely influential" on his songwriting.<ref name="TheGuardianInterview">{{harvnb|Pelley|2022}}</ref> During the making of ''Doolittle'' he listened heavily to the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]''.<ref name=sisario10>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=48–49}}</ref> He has cited [[Buddy Holly]] as a model for his compressed songwriting.<ref name=sisario11>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=46}}</ref> Francis did not discover [[punk rock]] until he was 16, saying "it was good I didn't listen to these hip records". As a child, he listened mainly to 1960s songs, religious music and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|Emerson Lake and Palmer]], [...] and [[Talking Heads]], who he says "weren't punk either".<ref>{{harvnb|Barker|2015}}</ref>

Santiago listened to 1970s and 1980s punk including [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], as well as [[David Bowie]]<ref name="officialprofile" /> and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Tuffrey|first=Laurie|date=May 22, 2014|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/15323-joey-santiago-pixies-favourite-albumsPlanets?page=11|title=Planets Of Sound: Joey Santiago Of Pixies' Favourite Albums|work=The Quietus|access-date=January 21, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180808162013/http://thequietus.com/articles/15323-joey-santiago-pixies-favourite-albumsPlanets?page=11|archive-date=August 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Guitarists who influenced him include [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Les Paul]], [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Lou Reed]]<ref>{{Cite news |last=Curley |first=John |title=10 Albums That Changed My Life: Joey Santiago of The Pixies |url=https://www.goldminemag.com/10-albums-that-changed-my-life/10-albums-that-changed-my-life-joey-santiago-of-the-pixies |access-date=2022-02-28 |website=Goldmine Magazine: Record Collector & Music Memorabilia |language=en}}</ref> and [[George Harrison]].<ref name="sisario12">{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=12, 49}}</ref> Deal's musical background was folk music and [[country music|country]]; she had formed a country-folk band with her sister in her teenage years, and played covers of artists such as [[the Everly Brothers]] and [[Hank Williams]].<ref name="barton" /> Other artists Deal listened to included [[XTC]], [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and [[Elvis Costello]].<ref name=rogers>{{harvnb|Rogers|2009}}</ref> Lovering is a fan of the band [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref name=barton />

Film has influenced the Pixies; Francis cites surrealist films ''[[Eraserhead]]'' and ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (as mentioned in "Debaser") as influences.<ref name="officialprofile" /> He has said he "didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels", but found it easier to watch twenty-minute films.<ref name=sisario13>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=29}}</ref>

=== Songwriting, lyrical themes and vocals ===
Most of the Pixies' songs are composed and sung by Francis. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine has described Francis's writing as containing "bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture".<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> Biblical violence is a theme of ''Doolittle''{{'}}s "Dead" and "Gouge Away";<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /><ref name=sisario14>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=94, 119–120}}</ref> Francis told a ''Melody Maker'' interviewer, "It's all those characters in the [[Old Testament]]. I'm obsessed with them. Why it comes out so much I don't know."<ref name="sisario16">{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=18}}</ref> He has described ''Come On Pilgrim{{'}}s'' "Caribou" as being about reincarnation,<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> and extraterrestrial themes appear in a number of songs on ''Bossanova''.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" />

Deal co-wrote ''Doolittle''{{'}}s "Silver" with Francis,<ref name=doolittle>{{harvnb|Doolittle}}</ref> and they share lead harmony vocals on the track.<ref name="Sisario, 2006. p. 16" /> She also co-wrote and sang lead vocals on ''Surfer Rosa''{{'}}s "Gigantic",<ref name=Chick/><ref name=surferrosa>{{harvnb|Surfer Rosa}}</ref> and wrote the 2004 single "Bam Thwok".<ref name=rogers /><ref>{{harvnb|Pixies Pen First New Song In 13 Years}}</ref> She was credited as Mrs. John Murphy on "Gigantic"<ref name=surferrosa />—at the time she was married, and she used this name as an ironic [[Feminism|feminist]] joke.<ref name=sisario16 /> She also sang lead vocals on the song "Into the White" and the [[Neil Young]] cover "Winterlong", both B-sides.<ref name=b-sides />

Lovering sang lead vocals on ''Doolittle''{{'}}s "La La Love You"<ref name="doolittle" /> and the B-side "Make Believe".<ref name="b-sides" /> Lenchantin made her lead vocal debut on ''Head Carrier''{{'}}s "All I Think About Now".<ref>{{harvnb|Hogan|2016}}</ref> She also provided lead vocals on "Los Surfers Muertos", from 2019's ''Beneath The Eyrie'' and the 2020 September single "Hear Me Out".

== Legacy ==
The Pixies' first album, ''Surfer Rosa'', is certified gold, while ''Doolittle'' is certified platinum, selling over 1&nbsp;million copies. The band influenced a number of musicians associated with the alternative rock boom of the 1990s.<ref>{{harvnb|Artists: Pixies}}</ref><ref name=egan>{{harvnb|Egan|2009}}</ref> Gary Smith, who produced ''Come On Pilgrim'', said in 1997:<ref name=egan/>

<blockquote>I've heard it said about [[the Velvet Underground]] that while not a lot of people bought their albums, everyone who did started a band. I think this is largely true about the Pixies as well. Charles' secret weapon turned out to be not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.</blockquote>

The Pixies are credited with popularizing the extreme dynamics and stop-start timing that would become widespread in alternative rock. Their songs typically feature hushed, restrained verses, and explosive, wailing choruses.<ref name=magnet/>

Artists including David Bowie, [[Matt Noveskey]], [[Radiohead]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[U2]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[the Strokes]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]], [[Kings of Leon]] and [[Matthew Good]] have cited admiration of the Pixies.<ref name="carew" /><ref name="rhino">{{cite web|url=http://www.rhinomedia.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=330 |title=The reunion tour of the year has come to DVD |work=Rhino Magazine |date=July 25, 2005 |access-date=September 9, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715181115/http://www.rhinomedia.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=330 |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Alexakis">{{cite web|url=http://magnetmagazine.com/2010/01/19/from-the-desk-of-everclears-art-alexakis-the-pixies%E2%80%99-%E2%80%9Cdoolittle%E2%80%9D/|title=Magnet Magazine|author=Alexakis| access-date=July 28, 2018}}</ref> [[Bono]] of U2, one of the Pixies' influences, said the Pixies had made "just about the most compelling music of the entire 80s" and were one of the greatest American bands.<ref name="rhino" /> Radiohead's [[Thom Yorke]] said that the Pixies "changed [his] life".<ref name="egan" />

One notable citation as an influence was by [[Kurt Cobain]], on influencing Nirvana's "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies' style. In a January 1994 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he said, "I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it [smiles]. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band—or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard."<ref name="egan" /><ref>{{harvnb|Dowling|2004}}</ref> Cobain cited ''Surfer Rosa'' as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album's natural and powerful drum sounds—a result of Steve Albini's influence on the record. Albini later produced Nirvana's 1993 ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' at the request of Cobain.<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|1994|pp=312–313}}</ref>
