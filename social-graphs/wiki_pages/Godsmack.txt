'''Godsmack''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], formed in 1995. The band is currently composed of lead singer and rhythm guitarist [[Sully Erna]] and bassist [[Robbie Merrill]]. Since its formation, Godsmack has released nine studio albums, one EP (''[[The Other Side (Godsmack EP)|The Other Side]]''), four DVDs, one compilation album (''[[Good Times, Bad Times... Ten Years of Godsmack]]''), and one live album (''[[Live & Inspired]]''). Their final album, ''[[Lighting Up the Sky]]'', was released in 2023.

Since its inception, Godsmack has toured with [[Ozzfest]] on more than one occasion and has toured with many other large tours and festivals, including supporting its albums with its own arena tours. They have released three consecutive number-one albums (''[[Faceless (Godsmack album)|Faceless]]'', ''[[IV (Godsmack album)|IV]]'' and ''[[The Oracle (Godsmack album)|The Oracle]]'') on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and have had 25 top-ten [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|rock radio hits]] and 12 at number one.<ref>{{cite web |title=Godsmack Chart History – Mainstream Rock |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/godsmack/chart-history/rtt/ |access-date=May 11, 2018 |website=billboard.com |publisher=Billboard Magazine}}</ref> In honor of the band's success and the release of their sixth studio album, ''[[1000hp (album)|1000hp]]'', Mayor [[Marty Walsh]] declared August 6 as "Godsmack Day" in the city of [[Boston]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2014/08/06/celebrating-godsmack-day/LNEu6YW5eZbGzKJE1IzJGI/story.html |title=Mayor Walsh marks Godsmack Day |newspaper=The Boston Globe |last=Shanahan |first=Mark |date=August 7, 2014 |access-date=August 7, 2014}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and ''All Wound Up...'' (1995–1997)===
In February 1995, [[Sully Erna]] decided to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for more than 23 years, including more than two years in the now-defunct band Strip Mind.<ref name="Godsmack biography">{{cite web |url= http://www.godsmack.com/bio/bio.asp |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171134/http://www.godsmack.com/bio/bio.asp |archive-date= September 30, 2007 |title=Godsmack – Bio |access-date=October 10, 2007 |publisher=Godsmack.com}}</ref> His new band, The Scam, formed with Erna on vocals, [[Robbie Merrill]] on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and [[Tommy Stewart]] on drums.

Locally popular songs such as "[[Keep Away (song)|Keep Away]]" and "[[Whatever (Godsmack song)|Whatever]]" soon brought them to the top of the hit charts in the Boston/New England area.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>

The band's name does not derive from the [[Godsmack (song)|Alice in Chains song of the same name]];  according to Erna, the name instead came from an incident where he developed a [[cold sore]] shortly after a former bandmate did:<blockquote>"I was making fun of [our drummer at the time]<ref name=":0" /> who had a cold sore on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, 'It's a god smack.' The name stuck.

Eventually, Godsmack's CD landed in the hands of Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station [[WKVB (FM)|WAAF (FM)]]. The radio station put "Keep Away" into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/> Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled "Whatever", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM).<ref name="Godsmack biography"/><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> In an interview Sully Erna stated, "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album.

In June 1998, [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]/[[Republic Records]] signed the band to their label.  The band's first album ''All Wound Up...'' was slightly edited to remove unlicensed samples, fully re-mastered and given a new artwork and layout; the finished self-titled album ''[[Godsmack (album)|Godsmack]]'' was released to the public six weeks later on August 25, 1998.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=April 26, 2001 |title=Interview - Godsmack |url=http://www.brokensilence.de/interviews/igodsmack1299.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010426123329/http://www.brokensilence.de/interviews/igodsmack1299.htm |archive-date=April 26, 2001  |access-date=June 27, 2022 }}</ref> This led to the band's first headlining tour, "The Godsmack Tour" with [[Jim Rose Circus]] as the opening act.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/> After the album's release the band went on the road playing club shows as well as playing at [[Ozzfest]] and [[Woodstock '99]].

The album sold well despite being initially pulled from the shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its [[Lyrics|lyrical]] content.<ref name="MTV">{{cite web |title=Godsmack Album Pulled From Wal-Mart, Kmart |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1429571/godsmack-album-pulled-from-wal-mart-kmart/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416164642/http://www.mtv.com/news/1429571/godsmack-album-pulled-from-wal-mart-kmart/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 16, 2019 |website=MTV News |access-date=May 27, 2022 |language=en |date=June 2, 1999}}</ref> The band and its record label later added a [[Parental Advisory]] sticker to the album,<ref name="MTV"/> and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine stating, "Our record has been in the marketplace for more than a year now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint&nbsp;... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective&nbsp;... We have decided to put a sticker on the record." This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped; "It's almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we're saying on it."<ref name="loudwire-godsmack">{{cite web |last1=Childers |first1=Chad |title=23 Years Ago: Godsmack Unleash Their Self-Titled Debut Album |url=https://loudwire.com/godsmack-self-titled-album-anniversary/ |website=Loudwire |access-date=May 27, 2022 |language=en |date=August 25, 2021}}</ref> The album also had four successful singles which were "Whatever", "Keep Away", "[[Voodoo (Godsmack song)|Voodoo]]" and "[[Bad Religion (song)|Bad Religion]]".<ref name="loudwire-godsmack"/>

In 2000, Godsmack returned to the studio after the multi-platinum success of ''[[Godsmack (album)|Godsmack]]'' to start recording ''[[Awake (Godsmack album)|Awake]]''.

"[[Ozzfest]]" was actually the only big tour where we rode under someone else's wings; we did a lot of work on our own."

Two of the songs on the album were used in United States Navy commercials ("[[Sick of Life]]" and "[[Awake (Godsmack song)|Awake]]") as background music.
