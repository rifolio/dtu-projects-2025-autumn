The band's line-up remained stable for nearly 29 years, from March 1979 until January 2008, when frontman [[Ali Campbell]] left the band, followed shortly thereafter by keyboardist Mickey Virtue. Another member, Astro, continued with the band until November 2013, when he departed to team up with Campbell and Virtue in a new version of UB40. In 2014, legal advice was sought by the original band (now consisting of remaining co-founding members drummer Jimmy Brown, guitarist Robin Campbell, bassist Earl Falconer, percussionist Norman Hassan, and saxophonist Brian Travers, along with new vocalist Duncan Campbell), who took action against the group formed by Campbell, Virtue, and Astro over the use of the band name, as both parties were using it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/news/legal-advice-sought-in-ub40-dispute-29944563.html |title=Legal advice sought in UB40 dispute |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=23 January 2014 |access-date=18 December 2014 |archive-date=2 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402174741/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/news/legal-advice-sought-in-ub40-dispute-29944563.html |url-status=live }}</ref> On 5 July 2021, it was announced that Matt Doyle, formerly of the reggae band Kioko, would become the band's new vocalist following Duncan Campbell's retirement due to ill health.

==History==

===1978–1983: Formation and rise to stardom===
{{quote box|quote= I lived in [[Balsall Heath]] in South Birmingham, which was a predominantly immigrant area. The first generation of [[British African-Caribbean people#The "Windrush generation"|Windrush kids]] were all my friends, and I grew up with Indian and Jamaican friends. So the music of the streets was Indian music, which I love—Mohammad Rafi and Asha Bhosle and all that—and reggae.|source=—UB40 vocalist [[Ali Campbell]] in an interview with the [[BBC]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|title=UB40's Ali Campbell: 'We're still cool'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44212628|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 May 2018|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-date=27 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527030207/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44212628|url-status=live}}</ref>|width=30%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

The band members initially formed friendships while attending various schools across [[Birmingham]], England.<ref name="Telegraph"/> The name "UB40" was chosen in reference to an attendance card issued to individuals claiming [[unemployment benefits]] from the UK government's [[Department of Employment]]. The designation UB40 stood for '''U'''nemployment '''B'''enefit, Form '''40'''.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

The origins of what would become UB40 can be traced back to mid-1978, when guitarist Ali Campbell, along with drummer Jimmy Brown and bassist Earl Falconer, began rehearsing a mix of popular reggae covers and their own original compositions. They were soon joined by several friends, first percussionists Yomi Babayemi and Norman Hassan, followed by saxophonist Brian Travers and keyboardist Jimmy Lynn. Although Robin Campbell was initially hesitant to commit to forming a band, he eventually joined after being persuaded by his brother Ali. He bought a guitar in December of that year to participate in their jam sessions.

With Robin's inclusion, the eight musicians officially formed a band, choosing the name "UB40" after a friend suggested it as a fitting reference to their shared unemployed status at the time. Before fully committing to the band, Travers had been working as an electrical apprentice for NG Bailey, while Robin Campbell had been an apprentice toolmaker.<ref name="LLC1985">{{cite book  |title=SPIN |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16jp_aFRHdgC&pg=PA60 |date=June 1985   |pages=60–61 |issn=0886-3032 |access-date=9 October 2016 |archive-date=9 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809044414/https://books.google.com/books?id=16jp_aFRHdgC&pg=PA60 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="CampbellCampbell200660">{{cite book |author1=Ali Campbell |author2=Robin Campbell |title=Blood and Fire: The Autobiography of the UB40 Brothers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwQP5JmiYEQC&pg=PA60 |date=1 June 2006 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-0-09-947654-2 |pages=60– |access-date=9 October 2016 |archive-date=2 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502053346/https://books.google.com/books?id=wwQP5JmiYEQC&pg=PA60 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:UB40 first gig.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque commemorating UB40's first concert at the Hare & Hounds in [[Kings Heath]], Birmingham]]

This line-up of the band lasted long enough to perform their first show at the [[Hare & Hounds, Kings Heath|Hare & Hounds]] pub in Kings Heath in February 1979 and one more gig before undergoing their first line-up change. Babayemi and Lynn left the group, with Mickey Virtue joining as keyboardist in place of Lynn. The classic UB40 line-up was completed a month later with the addition of percussionist and vocalist Astro, who had previously worked with Duke Alloy's [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] and attended reggae dances across Birmingham.<ref name="LLC1985"/><ref name="CampbellCampbell200660"/>

Before some of the members had learned to play their [[Musical instrument|instruments]] properly, Ali Campbell and Brian Travers travelled around Birmingham promoting the band by putting up UB40 [[poster]]s. The band's distinctive sound was developed and refined through numerous lengthy jam sessions held at various locations around the city.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

[[File:Ali Campbell at Raggamuffin 2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Vocalist Ali Campbell]]
Their first gig took place on 9 February 1979 at The Hare & Hounds Pub in [[Kings Heath]], Birmingham, for a friend's birthday party. This was commemorated in October 2011 by the unveiling of a plaque at the venue, recognising the band receiving the [[Performing Rights Society]]'s Music Heritage Award.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-15156316|title=UB40 given Music Heritage Award|date=4 October 2011|website=BBC|access-date=29 September 2019|archive-date=12 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212045032/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-15156316|url-status=live}}</ref> UB40 had their first significant opportunity when [[Chrissie Hynde]] saw them perform at a pub and invited them to support her band, [[The Pretenders]]. The band's debut single, "[[King (UB40 song)|King]]"/"[[Food for Thought (song)|Food for Thought]]", was released on Graduate Records, a local independent label run by David Virr. It reached No. 4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

The title of their first album, ''[[Signing Off]]'', signifies that the band was signing off from, or ending, their claim for unemployment benefits. It was recorded in a [[bedsit]] in Birmingham and produced by Bob Lamb. Norman Hassan remarked of the recording: "If you stripped my track down, you could hear the birds in the background." This is because his tracks were recorded outside in the garden. ''Signing Off'' was released on 29 August 1980. It entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] on 2 October 1980 and spent a total of 71 weeks on the chart. ''Signing Off'' is now a [[Platinum album]]. As UB40 gained in popularity, they encouraged and supported local musicians and bands from Birmingham, such as [[Beshara (band)|Beshara]], often bringing them on tour.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ub40.co.uk/forum/ub40-discussion/590079-bt-question-about-beshara.html |title = UB40 & Beshara&nbsp;– Brian Travers on Beshara |author = Brian Travers |work = ub40.co.uk |access-date = 15 May 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120305063735/http://www.ub40.co.uk/forum/ub40-discussion/590079-bt-question-about-beshara.html |archive-date = 5 March 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Following great success in the UK, UB40's popularity in the US was solidified with the release of ''[[Labour of Love]]'', an album of [[cover song]]s, in 1983. The album reached number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and number 14 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US five years later. The album featured the song "[[Red Red Wine#UB40 version|Red Red Wine]]", a [[cover version]] of a [[Neil Diamond]] song (arranged similarly to Tony Tribe's version); it reached number one in the UK in 1983 and number one in the US in 1988. Three years later, UB40 performed at the [[Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986]]. In 1987, Ray "Pablo" Falconer, the producer of UB40's music, died in a car crash. His brother, Earl Falconer, the band's bassist, was driving with nearly twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood. Earl was sentenced to six months' imprisonment in June 1988 and banned from driving for three years.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-06-27-ca-3688-story.html |title = MORNING REPORT: Pop/rock |date = 27 June 1988 |first1 = John |last1 = Voland |first2 = Steve |last2 = Weinstein |access-date = 16 December 2014 |archive-date = 19 December 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141219215829/http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-27/entertainment/ca-3688_1_earl-falconer |url-status = live }}</ref>

==Influences==
UB40 were influenced by the many [[Sound system (Jamaican)|blues parties]] they attended as teenagers in the multicultural [[Balsall Heath]] area of Birmingham. They were inspired by artists like [[Bob Marley]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. Their love of [[ska]], [[reggae]] and early [[lovers rock]] inspired such original tracks as "King", "Madam Medusa", "Food for Thought", "Signing Off" and "One in Ten".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.solarnavigator.net/music/ub40.htm |title = UB40 A to Z DIRECTORY OF SINGERS AND SONGS |website = Solarnavigator.net |access-date = 24 April 2014 |archive-date = 14 February 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214034148/http://www.solarnavigator.net/music/ub40.htm |url-status = live }}</ref> Their early musical style was unique, with a heavy influence of [[analogue synthesizer|analogue synthesisers]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] [[Rock and roll|rock]] guitar, saxophone and [[dub music|dub]] producer techniques.<ref>{{cite web |title = UB40: The History |url = http://www.ub40.co.uk/introduction.html |website = Ub40.co.uk |access-date = 17 December 2014 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214181344/http://www.ub40.co.uk/introduction.html |archive-date = 14 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

==Achievements==
UB40 are one of the most commercially successful reggae acts in history in terms of record sales (over 70 million), chart positions, and touring schedule.<ref name=TFE/> Over the course of their career, they have performed sell-out shows worldwide, headlined the [[Reggae Sunsplash]] music festival in [[Jamaica]], and introduced reggae to places such as Russia and South America. They have performed twice at the [[Night of the Proms]], in 2000 and 2006. They have been nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album]] four times, and in 1984, they were nominated for the [[Brit Award]] for Best British Group.<ref name="Brits"/>

In October 2011, UB40 were honoured with a [[Heritage Award]], a ceremonial plaque from the UK's [[PRS for Music]]. The plaque was placed at the Hare & Hounds Pub in [[Birmingham]], England, the venue where they played their first gig.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2011/10/04/ub40-see-plaque-unveiled-at-kings-heath-pub-the-hare-hounds-65233-29537825/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020225053/http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2011/10/04/ub40-see-plaque-unveiled-at-kings-heath-pub-the-hare-hounds-65233-29537825/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-10-20|title=UB40 see plaque unveiled at Kings Heath pub the Hare & Hounds - West Midlands News - News - Birmingham Post|date=20 October 2011}}</ref>

All three of their UK number one hits and four of their five US [[Billboard Hot 100|top ten]] hits were [[cover version]]s. UB40's collaborators include: [[Pato Banton]], [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[Bitty McLean]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], [[Maxi Priest]], [[Robert Palmer]], [[Hunterz]], Japanese artist Mikidozan, French artist Nuttea, [[Lady Saw]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], and [[808 State]]. With 214 weeks spent on the UK singles charts during the 1980s, UB40 and Madness hold the record for the most weeks spent by a group on the UK singles charts during that decade.<ref name="The News"/>

Reflecting on the group's longevity, Ali Campbell has said that they were fortunate in choosing a relatively young genre, as reggae "... hasn't outlived its own cool like jazz has".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44212628|title=UB40's Ali Campbell: 'We're still cool'|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=2018-05-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-GB|archive-date=27 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527030207/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44212628|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Biographies==

===Astro===
Terence Oswald Wilson (24 June 1957 – 6 November 2021), better known by his stage name Astro, was a British musician, rapper, and toaster, who was part of UB40 from 1979 until he left the group in November 2013.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|date=2021-11-07|title=UB40 founding member Astro dies after short illness|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59195024|access-date=2021-11-07|archive-date=7 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211107081135/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59195024|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ub40.co.uk/astro.html |title=Astro |publisher=Ub40.co.uk |access-date=2011-01-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606163819/http://www.ub40.co.uk/astro.html |archive-date=6 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Astro-quits-UB40-band_15505283 | title=Astro quits UB40 band | work=Jamaica Observer | date=23 November 2013 | access-date=1 March 2014 | archive-date=10 February 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210055027/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Astro-quits-UB40-band_15505283 | url-status=live }}</ref> His nickname originated from his childhood, as he wore a pair of Dr. Martens boots with the model name "Astronaut".<ref name=:0/>

Born to Jamaican immigrant parents, he went to school with the future keyboard player of UB40, Virtue. While DJ-ing, he met the Campbell brothers, and bonded so well with them over a shared love of Jamaican music that they invited him to join them as their MC. He believed that reggae music was for everyone, not just for Jamaican Rastafarians.<ref name="TFE" />

In the band's 1983 version of "Red Red Wine," he added his own "toasting" lyrics, a Jamaican precursor to rapping. This became an integral part of the group's sound. Astro offered the band a more militant edge, rapping about social injustice and racism. He experienced racism himself when he was refused entry to nightclubs because of his dreadlocks, while white members of the band were allowed in.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Astro obituary|newspaper=[[The Times]]|language=en|url=https://www.thetimes.com/uk/article/astro-obituary-68dvpm5mq|access-date=2021-11-11|issn=0140-0460|archive-date=11 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211111122951/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/astro-obituary-68dvpm5mq|url-status=live}}</ref>

He eventually quit the band in 2013 after they decided to record a set of country songs. He was not interested in this genre of music and was solely focused on performing and promoting reggae. He went on to join Ali Campbell and Virtue in a rival band to UB40.<ref name="TFE" />

Astro died following a short illness on 6 November 2021, at the age of 64.<ref name=":0" />

===Duncan Campbell===
[[File:DuncanCampbell.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Duncan Campbell with UB40, [[Birmingham Symphony Hall]], 2010]]
'''Duncan Campbell''' (born 3 April 1958 in [[Birmingham]]) is an English musician and former lead singer of UB40. He joined the band in 2008 after the departure of his brother [[Ali Campbell]],<ref name=Duncan>{{cite web |last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7375518.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; UB40 singer replaced by brother |publisher=BBC News |date=2 May 2008 |access-date=27 January 2011 |archive-date=13 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913062230/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7375518.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> the former UB40 lead singer. Current bandmate Robin Campbell is also his brother, and he is the son of the late folk singer [[Ian Campbell (folk musician)|Ian Campbell]].<ref name=Duncan/> Campbell announced his retirement from live concert performances after suffering a seizure in August 2020. His replacement as lead singer was announced on 5 July 2021 as Matt Doyle, formerly of the band Kioko.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ub40-duncan-campbell-matt-doyle-tour-2021-b1878158.html|title=UB40 replace Duncan Campbell with Matt Doyle as lead singer|date=5 July 2021|website=The Independent|access-date=5 July 2021|archive-date=5 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210705080306/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ub40-duncan-campbell-matt-doyle-tour-2021-b1878158.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Campbell sang in a harmony group with his brothers as children and performed with their father on stage. He also recorded a reggae album in Jamaica for his brother Ali's record label, but it was never released. He was a professional [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoon player]]. "I was the only professional spoon player in the country registered with the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] – until they registered me as a vocalist," said Campbell. He also worked as a casino manager in [[Barbados]], ran a [[fish and chip]] shop in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth, Australia]], and has worked as an actor.<ref name=Duncan/>

On 24 January 2008, UB40 lead singer [[Ali Campbell]] announced that he was leaving the band after a dispute with the management; UB40 announced that they would carry on. On 30 April 2008, UB40 unveiled Duncan as their new lead singer.

Duncan was offered the position of lead singer in 1978, but turned it down at the time, and said that he "wouldn't get the chance in another 30 years". Ali Campbell was "disappointed but didn't object" to him joining UB40. When asked why he did not join UB40 in 1978, he joked that it was because they were "crap"<ref>{{YouTube|hOwjh56Ldtc|UB40 UBTV..Christmas Special..Anant Shah asks Duncan...}} Recorded 29 November 2009.</ref> and that he "was too smart for them and he knew that they would get nowhere".<ref>{{YouTube|j7qqjFNIH48|UB40 play New Faces on BBC Midlands Today}}</ref> In 2014, Ali formed a rival version of UB40 with Astro and Mickey Virtue. He said of his brother's singing, "I sat back for five years and watched my brother Duncan murdering my songs.
