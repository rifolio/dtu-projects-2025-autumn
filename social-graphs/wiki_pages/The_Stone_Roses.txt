'''The Stone Roses''' were an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Manchester]] in 1983. They were one of the pioneering groups of the [[Madchester]] movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band's classic and most prominent lineup consisted of vocalist [[Ian Brown]], guitarist [[John Squire]], bassist [[Mani (musician)|Gary "Mani" Mounfield]], and drummer [[Reni (musician)|Alan "Reni" Wren]].

The Stone Roses released their [[The Stone Roses (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band, receiving widespread critical acclaim, and is regarded by many as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded.{{efn|Refer to [[The Stone Roses (album)#Accolades]]}} Following this success, the band sought to capitalize on their newfound fame by signing with a major label. However, their record label at the time, [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone]], would not let them out of their contract, leading to a lengthy legal battle that culminated with the band signing with [[Geffen Records]] in 1991.

The Stone Roses released their second album, ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'', in 1994, which received mixed reviews.<ref name="VoxFeb1995">{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Johnny|title=Coming Out|url=http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/press/vox-february-1995|access-date=24 November 2011|newspaper=Vox|date=February 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312041444/http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/press/vox-february-1995|archive-date=12 March 2010|pages=14–19|format=print}}</ref> The group soon disbanded after several lineup changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni departing in early 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at the [[Reading Festival]].

Following much media speculation, the Stone Roses announced their reunion on 18 October 2011 and embarked on a [[Reunion Tour (The Stone Roses)|world tour]] in 2012, including three homecoming shows in [[Heaton Park]], Manchester.<ref name="officialreunion">{{cite web |last=Goodwyn |first=Tom |date=17 October 2011 |title=Ian Brown on the Stone Roses reunion: 'It's happening' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-stone-roses-184-1286132 |access-date=17 October 2011 |work=NME}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/18/stone-roses-reunite-world-tour|title=Stone Roses announce comeback gigs in Manchester with world tour in pipeline|date=18 October 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=18 October 2011|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15348374|title=The Stone Roses to reunite for tour|date=18 October 2011|work=BBC News|access-date=18 October 2011}}</ref> Plans to record a third album were also floated, but only two singles were released.<ref name="newalbum">{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacelab.tv/spaceLAB/2011/10October/MusicNews-059-Stone-Roses-Reunion-Tour-New-Album-Press-Conference.htm|title=Stone Roses Reunion Tour and New Album is Happening|date=18 October 2011|work=Spacelab|access-date=18 October 2011|archive-date=25 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425080416/http://www.thespacelab.tv/spaceLAB/2011/10October/MusicNews-059-Stone-Roses-Reunion-Tour-New-Album-Press-Conference.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> In June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of the film ''[[Spike Island (film)|Spike Island]]'', revealed that the band "have at least three or four new tracks recorded".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Benson |first=Nikki |date=22 May 2012 |title=Stone Roses Have Recorded New Material |url=http://www.ssgmusic.com/stone-roses-confirm-new-material/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210130081359/http://www.ssgmusic.com/stone-roses-confirm-new-material/ |archive-date=30 January 2021 |access-date=2024-09-11 |website=SSG Music}}</ref><ref name="NME">{{Cite web |last=Goodwyn |first=Tom |date=2012-05-21 |title=The Stone Roses 'have at least three or four new tracks recorded' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-stone-roses-139-1285218 |access-date=2024-09-11 |website=NME}}</ref> In June 2013, a documentary about the band's reformation, directed by [[Shane Meadows]] and titled ''[[The Stone Roses: Made of Stone]]'', was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2126403/|title=The Stone Roses: Made of Stone (2013)|website=IMDb|access-date=14 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |date=2013-06-06 |title=The Stone Roses: Made of Stone – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/06/stone-roses-made-stone-review |access-date=2024-09-11 |work=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In 2016, the Stone Roses released their first new material in two decades. The band continued to tour until June 2017, at which point cryptic remarks by Brown indicated that the band had split again. This was later confirmed in a 2019 interview with Squire.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wollaston |first=Sam |date=16 September 2019 |title=John Squire: 'I don't think I'm a very good guitar player – or painter' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/16/john-squire-interview |access-date=17 September 2019 |website=The Guardian}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation (1983–1984)===
Ian Brown (initially the bassist) and guitarist John Squire, who knew each other from [[Altrincham Grammar School for Boys]], formed a short-lived [[The Clash|Clash]]-inspired band, The Patrol, in 1980 along with singer/guitarist Andy Couzens and drummer [[Simon Wolstencroft]].{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=40}}<ref name="Taylor">Taylor (2004)</ref> They played several gigs in 1980 and recorded a [[demo tape]], but towards the end of that year, they decided on a change of direction.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=46}} During their last Patrol show, Brown had a taste of being a frontman, singing [[The Sweet|Sweet]]'s "[[Block Buster!]]" to close the set. Pete Garner, a friend and roadie, stood in on bass while Couzens wanted to focus on guitar.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=46}}

In 1981, the band members lost enthusiasm. Brown sold his bass guitar to buy a scooter, and Wolstencroft joined [[Johnny Marr]] and [[Andy Rourke]]'s pre-[[The Smiths]] band [[Freak Party]].{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=48}} Squire continued to practice guitar<ref name="Taylor" /> while working as an animator for [[Cosgrove Hall]] during the day, while Brown ran a [[Northern soul]] night in a [[Salford]] club. 

Squire and Couzens started a new band, the Fireside Chaps, with bassist Gary "Mani" Mounfield, later recruiting a singer named David "Kaiser" Carty and drummer Chris Goodwin. They changed their name to the Waterfront (after the 1954 film ''[[On the Waterfront]]''), their sound influenced by 1960s groups and contemporary bands such as [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]].<ref name="Taylor" />{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp=65, 68}} Goodwin left before the band recorded their first demo and, shortly after it, Squire asked Brown to join as singer. A meeting with [[Geno Washington]] at a party at Brown's flat in [[Hulme]], in which Washington told Brown that he would be a star and should be a singer, convinced Brown to take Squire up on his offer.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp=70–71}} Brown joined the Waterfront in late 1983, for a time sharing vocals with Kaiser.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=71}}

Like the earlier attempts at bands, the Waterfront fizzled out. In late 1983, Couzens decided to try again by starting a band and approached Brown.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=77}} They decided on Wolstencroft (who had turned down the job of drummer in the Smiths) as drummer and Pete Garner as bassist (despite his admission that he could not play anything but "Block Buster!").{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=78}} They also decided that they needed Squire in the band, and when he agreed the band's lineup was cemented.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=78}} Leaving their previous bands behind, they worked solely on new material. Brown's vocal limitations prompted him to take singing lessons for three weeks.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=79}} After rehearsing for some time without a band name, Squire came up with "The Stone Roses". Several stories later emerged suggesting that the band had initially been called "English Rose" or that the name was somehow linked to [[the Rolling Stones]]. These stories were untrue, Brown explaining: "No, I don't know where that English Rose story came from. John thought up the name 'Stone Roses' - something with a contrast, two words that went against each other".{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=80}} The band rehearsed for six months, during which time Wolstencroft had been auditioning for other bands, and he left to join [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]]'s band [[the Colourfield]].{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=81}} They got Goodwin to rejoin, but he lasted for only one rehearsal, so they advertised for a replacement and began auditioning, eventually recruiting Alan "Reni" Wren in May 1984.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp=83–84}}

After rehearsing and writing songs over the summer, they recorded their first demo in late August, making 100 cassettes with artwork by Squire, and set about trying to get gigs.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=91}} They played their first gig as the Stone Roses on 23 October 1984, supporting [[Pete Townshend]] at an anti-[[heroin]] concert at the Moonlight Club in London. Brown had sent a demo with an accompanying letter: "I'm surrounded by skagheads, I wanna smash 'em. Can you give us a show?"{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp=91–92}} The show was seen by journalists including ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''{{'}} Garry Johnson, who arranged to interview the band a few weeks later.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=98}} The band received management offers and more gigs soon followed.

Howard "Ginger" Jones, who had recently left his job as director and general manager of [[the Haçienda]], producer [[Martin Hannett]] and Tim Chambers agreed to work with the band on an album, setting up Thin Line Records to release it. Jones took on management of the band, although they had already made a similar agreement with Caroline Reed in London.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp=99–100}} The band got their first positive press in late December, with Johnson tipping them for success in 1985 in ''Sounds'' magazine. A feature on the band followed in January.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=107}}

=== Early tour and releases (1985–1988) ===
The band played their first headlining gig on 4 January 1985, supported by [[Last Party]], after original headliners Mercenary Skank had pulled out.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=108}} They had their first recording session with [[Martin Hannett]] in January 1985 at [[Strawberry Studios]] in Stockport, aiming to record tracks for a debut single and an album.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=103}} Further sessions followed in March, during which they recorded their debut single, the double A-side "[[So Young (The Stone Roses song)|So Young]]"/"Tell Me".{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=110}} The band were invited to play a live session on [[Piccadilly Radio]] in March, premiering a new song, "[[I Wanna Be Adored]]".{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=113}} [[Tony Michaelides]] (aka Tony the Greek) from the station arranged for five local bands to play at [[Dingwalls]] in London on 8 February: Glee Company, Communal Drop, Fictitious Names, Laugh, and the Stone Roses. [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]], another Piccadilly DJ, was compère for the night. By this time, the Stone Roses had started to build a sizeable following in Manchester. Their first gig in the North of England, at Clouds in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], attracted a large audience and descended into a riot after technical problems and friction between the bands on the bill.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp=115–117}}

The Roses embarked on a tour of Sweden in April, with their first gig in Manchester following their return, at [[The International Nightclub Manchester|International 1]], a venue run by future Stone Roses managers Matthew Cummins and Gareth Evans.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=122}} A performance at a warehouse party on 20 July helped to build interest in the band, and in August they returned to the studio to record their debut album.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=128}} Unhappy with the results and with the band's sound changing, it was shelved (later released as ''[[Garage Flower]]'').<ref>Taylor, p. 150</ref> The "So Young"/"Tell Me" single, however, was released on Thin Line Records in September.<ref>{{Cite web |title=So Young {{!}} Stop and Smell The Stone Roses |url=https://sites.psu.edu/passiongross/2021/09/17/so-young/ |access-date=2024-09-11 |website=sites.psu.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Pollock |first=David |date=2016-06-15 |title=Stone Roses – 10 of the best |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jun/15/stone-roses-10-of-the-best |access-date=2024-09-11 |work=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Frustrated with the lack of attention they were getting locally, the band engaged in a graffiti campaign, with [[Ian Brown]] and [[Reni (musician)|Reni]] spraying the band's name on walls from [[West Didsbury]] to the city centre.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=138}} This brought them negative publicity but added to their increasing notoriety. In 1986, they began working on new material, including "[[Sally Cinnamon]]", and the planned follow-up singles to "So Young" ("I Wanna Be Adored" and "This Is the One") were shelved.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=143}} They parted company with Jones and took on Gareth Evans as manager, using Evans' International 1 venue as their new rehearsal space. Around this time, the band played several UK tour dates, including 11 August 1986 at the Mardi Gras club in Liverpool with local promoter and record label owner Ken Kelly and his band Innervision, at which several record company executives would be in attendance.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp=146–148}}

As Brown and John Squire began collaborating more closely on songwriting, they decided to take a larger slice of the money than the other band members. Andy Couzens and Reni left the band in protest, although they soon returned. Couzens played an ill-fated gig with the band at the end of May before being pushed out of the band by Evans after flying home alone while the rest of the band returned in their van.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=150}} Although they failed to achieve further success in 1986, their repertoire expanded to include songs such as "[[Sugar Spun Sister]]", influenced by bands like [[the Jesus & Mary Chain]] and the indie-pop era [[Primal Scream]] ("[[Velocity Girl (song)|Velocity Girl]]" being a major influence on "[[Made of Stone]]"), and they stopped playing the older songs.{{sfn|Robb|2001|pp=154–155}}

In December 1986, they recorded their first demo as a four-piece, including the first studio recordings of "Sugar Spun Sister" and "[[Elephant Stone]]".{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=156}} In early 1987, Evans negotiated a deal with [[Revolver Music|Black/FM Revolver]] for a one-off release on the specially created Black Records label. By the time of the release of the single "Sally Cinnamon", the group's sound had changed considerably, with chiming guitar hooks and a strong melody, alienating some of their old fans but attracting many new ones.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=162}} "Sally Cinnamon" sold out its 1,000-copy run but failed to make the desired impact.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The story behind The Stone Roses' Sally Cinnamon |url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/stone-roses/what-is-the-stone-roses-sally-cinnamon-about/ |access-date=2024-09-11 |website=Radio X}}</ref>

In June, [[Pete Garner]] announced that he had decided to leave the band, although he stayed until they found a replacement. He played his final gig with the band at the 'Larks in the Park' festival in Liverpool.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=166}} Rob Hampson was Garner's replacement, with Garner teaching him the bass parts before leaving, although Hampson lasted only a week.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=167}} A more permanent replacement was found in the form of former Waterfront bassist [[Mani (musician)|Mani]], who played his first gig with the band in November 1987.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=167}} Brown recalled, "When Mani joined it almost changed overnight. It became a totally different groove ... Straight away, everything just fell into place".<ref>McCready</ref>

In early 1988, the band played at Dingwalls in London, a show attended by representatives of [[Zomba Music Group|Zomba]] and [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]'s [[Geoff Travis]], and both subsequently wanted to sign the band. Rough Trade even funded studio time to record a single, "[[Elephant Stone]]", with [[Peter Hook]] producing.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=173}} Hook was considered to produce an album for the band but was unavailable due to commitments with [[New Order (band)|New Order]], so Travis suggested [[John Leckie]].{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=176}} In May, the band played a high-profile concert at Manchester's [[International 2]] with [[James (band)|James]], organized by [[Dave Haslam]] to raise funds for a campaign against [[Section 28|Clause 28]].<ref name="Haslam">Haslam, p. 180</ref> The band attempted to usurp James by putting up posters around town listing the Stone Roses as headliners and delaying their start time to get the headline slot themselves and limit the time that James could play for.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=180}} In the audience was a sixteen-year-old [[Liam Gallagher]], who was inspired to form a band himself.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=181}} [[Noel Gallagher]] also stated that he was inspired to do the same by attending one of their gigs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfR6JoDExcc |title=Noel Gallagher about Stone Roses |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-06 |access-date=2014-02-27}}</ref> Also in the audience was Glaswegian Roddy McKenna, A&R executive with [[Zomba Group|Zomba]], who later signed the band to the label. He asked if they could be transferred internally to Andrew Lauder's newly created guitar-based Silvertone Records subsidiary. The band signed an eight-album deal, buying the "Elephant Stone" tapes from Rough Trade and releasing them as a single in October 1988.<ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Steve |date=2021-12-14 |title=14 essential Stone Roses songs |url=https://www.classicpopmag.com/2021/12/best-stone-roses-songs/ |access-date=2024-09-11 |website=Classic Pop Magazine}}</ref>

In 1988 and early 1989 the Stone Roses recorded their debut album at [[Battery Studios]] and [[Konk (recording studio)|Konk Studios]] in London and [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales, produced by Leckie.<ref name="Taylor" /> The first single for Silvertone, "[[Elephant Stone]]", made little impact, and in early 1989 the band's performances outside the north-west were still attracting small audiences.{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=195}} "[[Made of Stone]]" received more press attention and was picked up for airplay by DJ [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] on his late night [[BBC Radio 1|Radio One]] show, but peaked at number ninety on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

In 1990, the Stone Roses' infamous paint attack on Revolver Records occurred, as a result of a conflict between the band and the label. The band was unhappy with how the label handled the release of their single "Sally Cinnamon" and the accompanying video without their permission.

To express their frustration, they decided to take matters into their own hands by visiting the label's office and throwing paint at the staff and property, including label founder Paul Birch's wife. The incident caused significant damage and led to legal consequences for the band members. 
In the BBC documentary ''Blood on the Turntable: War of the Roses'', Mani said that the group asked to stop at FADS DIY store in Northenden, on the outskirts of Manchester, to get tins of paint and overalls so Squire could "do some art".<ref name=BBCdoc />
The band were subsequently arrested and appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court, charged with causing £15,000–20,000 in damage.
Following the incident, Mr Birch said he estimated that the media hype alone had bought the group in excess of a quarter of a million pounds in publicity.
Mani said that [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Tony Iommi]] from [[Black Sabbath]] congratulated them for the incident.<ref name=BBCdoc>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGmY_D5aBUE | title=The Stone Roses Paint Throwing incident | website=[[YouTube]] | date=28 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/inside-story-day-stone-roses-18403651 | title=Day the Stone Roses attacked Wolverhampton record label with paint | date=12 June 2020 }}</ref>

The Stone Roses' outdoor concert at [[Spike Island (Halton)|Spike Island]] in [[Widnes]] on 27 May 1990 was attended by some 27,000 people, the support acts included DJs [[Dave Haslam]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], [[Frankie Bones]], Dave Booth, a [[Zimbabwe]]an drum orchestra, and the [[reggae]] artist [[Gary Clail]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Nicolson|first=Barry|url=https://www.nme.com/features/the-stone-roses-the-full-story-of-spike-island-25-years-on|title=The Stone Roses: The Full Story of Spike Island, 25 Years On|work=NME |date=27 May 2015 |access-date=27 May 2015}}</ref> The event, considered a failure at the time due to sound problems and bad organisation, has become legendary over the years as a "[[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] for the [[baggy]] generation".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/indie/stone-roses-at-spike-island/ |title=Seven Ages of Rock - Events - Stone Roses at Spike Island |publisher=BBC |date=12 August 1989 |access-date=18 July 2011}}</ref> In mid-2010 footage of the concert was published on [[YouTube]].

By July the band had released their final single for Silvertone, "[[One Love (The Stone Roses song)|One Love]]", which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart,<ref name="guinness_book" /> their highest placing yet. It was to be the Roses' last original release for four years as they entered a protracted legal battle to terminate their five-year contract with Silvertone, unhappy with how they had been paid by the label.<ref name="Strong2003">Strong (2003), p. 525</ref>{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=271}} Silvertone owners [[Zomba Records]] took out an injunction against the band in September 1990 to prevent them from recording with any other label, but in May 1991 the court sided with the group, which was then released from its contract.<ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine|last=Sutcliffe|first=Phil|date=5 March 1991|title=Stories|magazine=Q|volume=55|pages=11}}</ref> The Stone Roses subsequently signed with [[Geffen Records]] (garnering a million-pound advance for their next record) and began work on their second album.<ref>Sutcliffe, Phil (August 1991).

===''Second Coming'' and breakup (1992–1996)===
{{Main|Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)}}
Following the court case the Stone Roses separated themselves from Manchester's club culture and spent much of 1992 and 1993 travelling in Europe before starting work on their second album in mid-1993. Progress was slow, hampered by Brown's and Squire's new fatherhood and the death of several people close to the band. John Leckie ultimately left the project as the band would not sign a production contract. Afterwards the Stone Roses assumed production duties with engineer Simon Dawson at [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales, where they spent 347 ten-hour days working on the album.<ref name="Spin 1995" />

The Stone Roses finally released the album, ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'', on 5 December 1994.<ref name=VoxFeb1995 /><ref name="Spin 1995" /> Mostly written by John Squire, the music now had a shady, heavy [[blues rock]] sound, dominated by Squire's guitar riffs and solos. "[[Love Spreads]]" reached number two on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="guinness_book" /> ''Second Coming'' received a mixed reception from the British press, which music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] attributed to "the resentment that the Roses, divorced from the cultural moment that gave them meaning, were now just another band".<ref name="Spin 1995" />

In March 1995, just two weeks before a tour in support of ''Second Coming'' was due to begin, Reni exited the band, following a disagreement with Ian Brown.<ref name="SquireInterview">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWYWKqast70 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211102/jWYWKqast70| archive-date=2021-11-02 | url-status=live|title=John Squire Stone Roses XFM Interview With Dave Haslam |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-01-07 |access-date=2016-03-14}}{{cbignore}}</ref> A replacement drummer was found in Robbie Maddix, who had previously worked with [[Rebel MC]].<ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin (ed.)

A secret "come-back" tour of the UK was planned for April 1995 but cancelled after the music press announced the dates. A major blow was the cancellation of their engagement at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June 1995. John Squire had suffered a mountain-biking accident in northern California weeks before the show, breaking his collarbone.<ref name="Strong2003" /> The band finally organised a full UK tour for November and December 1995 and all dates sold out in a day.

[[John Squire]] announced his departure on 1 April 1996, releasing a statement saying it was: "the inevitable conclusion to the gradual social and musical separation that we have undergone in the past few years".<ref name="Larkin" /> [[Simply Red]]'s 1987/88 tour guitarist [[Aziz Ibrahim]], a former classmate of Pete Garner's at Burnage High School, was recruited as a replacement. The band continued for another six months, but there was a noticeable deterioration in the quality of its public performances after Squire's loss, and at [[Benicassim festival|Benicassim Festival]] and the [[Reading Festival]] Brown's voice was described as "so off-key it was excruciating to have to listen".<ref name="Larkin" /> The music press was united in its criticism, the ''NME'' describing "I Am the Resurrection" as "more like the eternal crucifixion".<ref name="TWGOAT">Perrone, Pierre (2008) "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/music-magazine/music-magazine-features/the-worst-gigs-of-all-time-772912.html The worst gigs of all time]", ''[[The Independent]]'', 24 January 2008</ref> Brown and Mani dissolved the group in October 1996.<ref name="Larkin" />

After the newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' published a story on 14 October 2011 citing that the Roses had signed for a series of gigs across the UK, rumours again began to circulate.

The band went on to influence other artists, most notably [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[the Verve]],<ref>{{harvnb|New Musical Express|2009}} "The Stone Roses blew me away, right from the very beginning.

==Relationship with the media==
As John Robb commented: "The Stone Roses would stonewall the journalist[s]. With shy guffaws, muttered asides, dispassionate staring, foot-shuffling silences and complete mind-numbing gaps, punctuated by the odd piece of incisive home-spun philosophy from Brown, who occasionally hinted at a well-read mind. There would be complete silence from John Squire, witty banter from Reni, and Mani spouting off if he let his guard drop."{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=225}} However, Robb clarified they "were no fools when it came to the media".{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=225}} He concluded: "One feature of the band's career had been their ability to stay on the news pages of the rock press almost permanently for years on end, including the years when they did fuck all. And they did this by hardly saying anything at all."{{sfn|Robb|2001|p=225}}
