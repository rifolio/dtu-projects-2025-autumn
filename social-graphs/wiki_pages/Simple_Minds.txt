'''Simple Minds''' are a Scottish [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Glasgow]] in 1977 by Alan Cairnduff as Johnny & The Self-Abusers, with long-standing band members [[Jim Kerr]] (lead vocals) and [[Charlie Burchill]] (lead guitarist) joining shortly afterwards. In January 1978, they began performing as Simple Minds. They released their debut album ''[[Life in a Day (album)|Life in a Day]]'' in 1979 to moderate commercial success. Subsequent album releases ''[[Real to Real Cacophony]]'' (1979) and ''[[Empires and Dance]]'' (1980) achieved limited commercial success and, after signing to [[Virgin Records]], they released their fourth album ''[[Sons and Fascination/Sister Feelings Call]]'' (1981), which became their most successful studio album to that point. Kerr and Burchill are the two members who have been with the band nearly throughout its whole history, and the only current permanent members and songwriters. As of 2023, the other current members of the live and studio band are bassist [[Ged Grimes]],  drummer [[Cherisse Osei]], backing singer Sarah Brown, guitarist and keyboardist Gordy Goudie and keyboardist Erik Ljunggren. Notable former members include keyboardist [[Mick MacNeil]], bassists [[Derek Forbes]] and [[John Giblin]] and drummers [[Brian McGee (drummer)|Brian McGee]] and [[Mel Gaynor]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1088/9}}</ref>

In April 1982, they released "[[Promised You a Miracle]]" as the [[lead single]] from their fifth album ''[[New Gold Dream (81/82/83/84)]]'' (1982), with "[[Glittering Prize]]" released as the second single before the album's release. Both singles were a commercial success internationally, whilst the album gave the band their breakthrough in international markets, reaching the top ten of the albums charts in New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web |title=SIMPLE MINDS |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/28243/simple-minds/ |website=Official Charts |access-date=12 July 2025 |language=en |date=12 May 1979}}</ref> as well as reaching the US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Simple Minds {{!}} Biography, Music & News |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/simple-minds/chart-history/tlp/ |website=Billboard |access-date=12 July 2025}}</ref> The albums third and final single, "[[Someone Somewhere in Summertime]]", was released in November 1982 to moderate success. In late 1983, they released "[[Waterfront (song)|Waterfront]]" as the lead single from their sixth album, ''[[Sparkle in the Rain]]'' (1984), which continued the bands commercial prominence, debuting at number one in both the United Kingdom and New Zealand. It was later certified Platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for sales in excess of 300,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web |title=Smiths, The Very Best Of The Smiths, Album - The BPI |url=https://www.bpi.co.uk/award/6183-1107-2 |website=BPI |access-date=12 July 2025 |language=en}}</ref> 

''[[Once Upon a Time (Simple Minds album)|Once Upon a Time]]'' (1985) was released as their seventh album, and was supported by the commercially successful singles "[[Alive and Kicking (song)|Alive and Kicking]]", "[[Sanctify Yourself]]", "[[All the Things She Said (Simple Minds song)|All the Things She Said]]" and "[[Ghostdancing]]". During this period, they released "[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]" which became an international success, reaching number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100]].

==History==
===Early years (1977–1979)===
Simple Minds originated from the [[punk rock|punk]] band Johnny & The Self-Abusers, formed in early 1977 on [[Glasgow#South Side|Glasgow's South Side]],<ref name="Larkin"/> as the brainchild of Alan Cairnduff. Cairnduff left the organisation of the band to John Milarky, suggesting that he enlist two strangers, singer and lyricist [[Jim Kerr]] and guitarist [[Charlie Burchill]]. Kerr and Burchill, who had been acquainted since age eight, roped in their school friends [[Brian McGee (drummer)|Brian McGee]] and Tony Donald to play drums and bass respectively. Milarky served as singer, guitarist and saxophonist, and recruited his friend Allan McNeill to be the band's third guitarist. Kerr doubled on keyboards, and Burchill also played violin.<ref name=sm-genesis>{{cite web |title=Simple Minds Genesis & Formation |url=https://www.simpleminds.com/1977/04/05/simple-minds-genesis-formation/ |website=Simpleminds.com |access-date=23 June 2024}}</ref> 

On 11 April 1977, Johnny & The Self-Abusers held their first performance at the Doune Castle pub in Glasgow, following up two weeks later as the opening act for [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]] in Edinburgh. They performed concerts in Glasgow over the ensuing summer, but a split developed in the band, with Milarky and McNeill forming one faction and the other consisting of Kerr, Donald, Burchill and McGee;<ref name=sm-genesis/> In November 1977, Johnny & The Self-Abusers released their only single, "Saints and Sinners", on [[Chiswick Records]] (which was dismissed as being "rank and file" in a ''Melody Maker'' review). The band split on the same day that the single was released, with Milarky and McNeill going on to form The Cuban Heels. Ditching the stage names and the overt punkiness, the remaining members continued together as Simple Minds (naming themselves after a [[David Bowie]] lyric from his song "[[Jean Genie]]"),<ref name="simpleminds.com/">{{cite web |title=History Of Simple Minds |url=https://www.simpleminds.com/history-simple-minds/ |website=SIMPLEMINDS.COM |access-date=12 July 2025}}</ref> making their very first performance at Glasgow's Satellite City on 17 January 1978.<ref name="simpleminds.com Act Of Love" /> 

In January 1978, Simple Minds recruited Duncan Barnwell as a second guitarist (allowing for an optional two-guitar line-up while also enabling Burchill to play violin). Meanwhile, Kerr had abandoned keyboards to concentrate entirely on vocals. In March 1978, Kerr, Burchill, Donald, Barnwell and McGee were joined by the [[Isle of Barra|Barra]]-born keyboard player [[Mick MacNeil]]. The band got a residency at the Mars Bar in Glasgow and played various other venues in Scotland<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/search?artist=73d6ba71&query=tour:%281978+Mars+Bar+Residency%29 |title=Simple Minds 1978 Mars Bar residency |publisher=setlist.fm }}</ref> and rapidly established a reputation as an exciting live act (usually performing in full makeup). Tony Donald quit in April 1978 and was replaced by Duncan Barnwell's friend Derek Forbes (formerly the bass player with The Subs). In May 1978 Simple Minds recorded their first [[demo (music)|demo tape]], including "Chelsea Girl" and some other tracks that would appear on their debut album.<ref name="DT">Dave Thomas ''Simple Minds Glittering Prize'' [[Omnibus Press]] 1985, p.17-23</ref> The group were turned down by record companies, but gained a management deal with Bruce Findlay, owner of the Bruce's Records chain of record shops and the [[Zoom Records (Scotland)|Zoom Records]] label.<ref name="DT" />  Championed by his journalist friend Brian Hogg, Findlay was persuaded to sign Simple Minds to his Zoom label which had a licensing deal with [[Arista Records]].<ref name="DT" /> In November 1978, Barnwell was ousted from the band.<ref name="DT" /> 

From 1979 through until 1981, Simple Minds would continue as a quintet of Kerr, Burchill, MacNeil, Forbes and McGee, operating as a tight-knit collective. Subsequent line-up changes would shrink and diminish this core band, with only founder members being considered to be full members of the creative and compositional team.

===Initial albums (1979–1980)===
During late 1978 and early 1979, Simple Minds began rehearsing the set of Kerr/Burchill-written songs which appear on their debut album.<ref name="DT" /> On 27 March 1979 the band made their first television appearance, performing the songs "Chelsea Girl" and "Life in a Day" on the BBC's ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/simple-minds/1979/the-old-grey-whistle-test-bbc-television-theatre-london-england-63c4beef.html |title=Simple Minds setlist at The Old Grey Whistle Test |publisher=setlist.fm }}</ref> The first Simple Minds album, ''[[Life in a Day (album)|Life in a Day]]'', was produced by [[John Leckie]] and released by Zoom Records in April 1979. The album's title track "Life in a Day" was released as Simple Minds' first single and reached No.&nbsp;62 in the [[UK singles chart]], with the album reaching No.&nbsp;30 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="Larkin"/> In April/May 1979 they made their first UK tour as supporting act for [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], who were a major influence on them at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simpleminds.com/2009/02/11/the-mighty-magazine/ |title=The Mighty Magazine |first=Jim |last=Kerr |date=11 February 2009 |publisher=simpleminds.com }}</ref>

In June 1979 "Chelsea Girl" was released as the second single from the album, failing to reach the chart, while the band continued to tour the UK on their own.<ref name="sm">{{Cite web|url=http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/timeline/index.htm |title=Timeline |publisher=Dream Giver Redux}}</ref> In September 1979 Simple Minds recorded their next album, ''[[Real to Real Cacophony]]'' at [[Rockfield Studios]] with producer [[John Leckie]]. The songs were mostly conceived in the studio and was a significant departure from the pop tunes of ''Life in a Day''.<ref name="Larkin"/> German [[Krautrock]] was now the band's main influence, adopting a more experimental electronic sound that drew influences from the motorik, repetitive grooves of bands such as [[Neu!]], [[Kraftwerk]] and [[La Düsseldorf]].<ref name="sa">Sean Albiez, David Pattie ''Kraftwerk: Music Non-Stop'' 2011, page 156</ref>

The band began their "Real to Real Cacophony Tour" in Germany and also made a short visit to New York in October 1979.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/search?artist=73d6ba71&query=tour:%28Real+to+Real+Cacophony+Tour%29 |title=Simple Minds Real to Real Cacophony Tour |work=setlist.fm }}</ref> Their performance of the songs "Premonition", "Factory" and "Changeling" at [[Hurrah (nightclub)|Hurrah]] was filmed for ''The Old Grey Whistle Test''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/simple-minds/1979/hurrah-new-york-ny-6bc4be96.html |title=Simple Minds setlist Hurrah, New York |publisher=setlist.fm}}</ref>

''Real to Real Cacophony'' was released in November 1979. While the band got little marketing support from their record company Arista, who didn't like the album, it received critical acclaim.<ref name="sm" /> The release was followed by their third UK tour of the year and a BBC session for [[John Peel]] in December.<ref name="sm"/> In January 1980 "Changeling" was released as the only single from ''Real to Real Cacophony'', failing to make an impression on the charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/discog/rtrc/c1.htm |title=Changeling |publisher=Dream Giver Redux }}</ref> In March they supported [[Gary Numan]] on a couple of gigs, and continued their Real to Real Cacophony Tour until June 1980 with dates mainly in Germany, France and the Netherlands.<ref>[http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/tours/t1979-2/index.htm Real to Real Cacophony Tour] Dream Giver Redux</ref> In June 1980 Simple Minds entered the studio to record their next album, again with producer [[John Leckie]] at Rockfield Studios.<ref name="sm"/> The band again had a new approach to their music that differed from the previous album, this time aiming for a more repetitive, dance-orientated sound inspired by [[disco music|disco]] music they had heard in nightclubs while touring Europe.<ref>Dave Thomas ''Simple Minds Glittering Prize'' Omnibus Press 1985, p.47</ref>

''[[Empires and Dance]]'' was released in September 1980.<ref name="Larkin"/> Many of the tracks were minimal and featured a significant use of [[Music sequencer|sequencing]], further exploring their repetitive Krautrock-influences with electronic dance grooves.<ref name="sa" /> McNeil's keyboards and Forbes' bass became the main melodic elements in the band's sound, with Burchill's heavily processed guitar becoming more of a textural element. With this album, Kerr began to experiment with non-narrative lyrics based on observations he had made as the band travelled across Europe on tour. While a modest commercial success, ''Empires and Dance'' received enthusiastic response in the British music press<ref>[http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/reviews/ead/pr1.htm New Musical Express 1980] Dream Giver Redux</ref> Simple Minds had caught the attention of [[Peter Gabriel]], who selected them as the opening act on several dates of his European tour starting in August 1980.<ref name="Tour 1980">[http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/tours/t1980-1/index.htm Empires and Dance Tour 1980] Dream Giver Redux</ref> The tour as Gabriel's support act gave the band the opportunity to play at bigger venues.<ref name="Tour 1980" /> 

''Empires and Dance'' peaked at no.41 on the UK Albums Chart and dropped out of the chart after three weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/28243/simple-minds/ |title=Simple Minds |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]}}</ref> The band's manager Bruce Findlay later blamed Arista for poor handling of the album and it not being more commercially successful. Initially Arista only released 7,500 copies of the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/27/a-nuclear-reactor-of-music-the-story-of-simple-minds-classic-album-empires-and-dance |title="A nuclear reactor of music": The Story of Simple Minds Classic Album Empires and Dance |first=Graeme |last=Thompson |date=27 June 2023 |work=[[The Guardian]] }}</ref>  Furthermore, Arista did not release a single to promote the album. "I Travel" was not released as a single until October to promote the Empires and Dance tour. The single sold poorly and did not reach the UK chart, but the 12" version became popular in the US club scene and (based on import sales only) entered the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Disco Chart at no.80 in early 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/discog/ead/it1.htm |title=I Travel |publisher=Dream Giver Redux}}</ref> "I Travel" was subsequently reissued twice in the UK, but again failed to reach the singles chart.

===Commercial breakthrough (1981–1983)===
====Signing to Virgin Records====

In early 1981, Simple Minds' frustration with poor support and marketing by Arista made them threaten to split up rather than continue working with them. They were released from Arista and instead signed to [[Virgin Records]].<ref name="Larkin"/><ref name="sm" /> After the band had left the label, Arista decided to release "Celebrate" as the second single from ''Empires and Dance'' in February 1981 to promote the album, with the earlier single "Changeling" on the b-side to promote ''Real to Real Cacophony'', but this single too sold poorly and failed to chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/discog/ead/c1.htm |title=Celebrate |publisher=Dream Giver Redux }}</ref> The following year, Arista put out a compilation album, ''[[Celebration (Simple Minds album)|Celebration]]'', featuring tracks from the three previous albums which reached No. 45 on the UK albums chart.<ref name="oc">{{cite web |title=SIMPLE MINDS |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/28243/simple-minds/ |website=Official Charts |access-date=12 July 2025 |language=en |date=12 May 1979}}</ref> Following their change of record company, the band demoed new songs and embarked on a club tour in the US and Canada.<ref name="sm" />

In May 1981, Simple Minds' first release on Virgin, the single "The American" reached No. 59 on the UK singles chart.<ref name="sm" /> The band recorded their next album with producer [[Steve Hillage]] and an abundance of new material under much time pressure.<ref name="sm" /> At the end of the recording sessions drummer Brian McGee decided to leave the band, citing exhaustion at Simple Minds' constant touring schedule,<ref name="Larkin"/> and a desire for more time at home with family.<ref name="sm" /> In an interview shortly after, he also cited disappointment that he was not getting enough credit in the band. McGee joined Glasgow band [[Endgames (band)|Endgames]],<ref>{{cite web | title=''The Beginning of the End (Betty Page makes the first move against Glasgow's Endgames)'', Record Mirror, 5 June 1982 | url =http://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/g8gAAOSwMmBVwIuH/s-l1600.jpg}}</ref> and later [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spirit-of-rock.com/en/band/Propaganda |title=Propaganda |publisher=Spirit of Rock }}</ref> In August, "[[Love Song (Simple Minds song)|Love Song]]" was released and became their highest charting single to date, peaking at No. 47 on the UK singles chart<ref name="oc" /> and an international hit, reaching the top 20 in Australia and Sweden, and no.38 in Canada.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|author-link=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970–1992|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|page=275|isbn=0-646-11917-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Simple+Minds&titel=Love+Song&cat=s|title=Swedishcharts.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.0444.pdf| title=RPM Top 50 Singles - January 16, 1982}}</ref> 

In September 1981, Virgin released the entirety of Simple Minds recent studio sessions on two albums: ''[[Sons and Fascination]]'' and ''[[Sister Feelings Call]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/><ref name="sm" /> The latter album was initially included as a bonus disc with the first 10,000 vinyl copies of ''Sons and Fascination'', but it was later re-issued as an album in its own right.<ref name="Larkin"/> (For the CD release, it was paired on a single disc with ''Sons and Fascination''{{spnd}}at first with two tracks deleted, but in full on later issues). The album reached No. 11 on the UK albums chart,<ref name="oc" /> and was subsequently placed as No. 18 on [[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] "Album of the Year"-chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/sounds.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910230125/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/sounds.html |url-status=usurped |archive-date=10 September 2012 |title=''Sounds'' End of Year Lists |publisher=Rocklist.net }}</ref> The next single "Sweat in Bullet" was a remixed version by [[Peter Walsh (producer)|Peter Walsh]] and included two songs recorded live at [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in September.<ref name="sm" /> During this period, the band's visual aesthetic was established, masterminded by [[Malcolm Garrett]]'s graphic design company Assorted iMaGes. Characterised at first by hard, bold typography and photo-collage, Garrett's designs for the band later incorporated pop-religious iconography in clean, integrated package designs that befitted the band's idealised image as neo-romantic purveyors of European anthemic pop.

To replace McGee as drummer (although not as full band member), Simple Minds hired Kenny Hyslop (ex-[[Skids (band)|Skids]], [[Slik]], Zones) to play on the first leg of the Sons and Fascination tour, which included Simple Minds first visit to Australia, touring with [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]].<ref name="Larkin"/><ref name="sm" /> Hyslop also played on the studio recording of "[[Promised You a Miracle]]", a song originating in a riff from a tape of funk music Hyslop played on the tour bus, that would become the band's next single.<ref name="pyam">{{cite web|url=http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/discog/ngd/pyam1.htm |title=Promised You a Miracle |publisher=Dream Giver Redux }}</ref> Despite this contribution, Hyslop ultimately "didn't fit in" with the band or their management and was replaced for the second leg of the Sons and Fascination tour<ref>[http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/tours/t1981-2/index.htm Sons and Fascination tour] Dream Giver Redux</ref> by the [[Kilmarnock]]-born percussionist [[Mike Ogletree]] (the former drummer for [[Café Jacques (band)|Café Jacques]]) in early 1982.<ref name="Larkin"/>

====''New Gold Dream (81–82–83–84)''====

Simple Minds started working on their next album in an old farmhouse in [[Fife]].

The band embarked on their extensive New Gold tour in September 1982, which included dates in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.<ref name="NGT">{{cite web|url=http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/tours/t1982-2/index.htm |title=New Gold Tour |publisher=Dream Giver Redux}}</ref> Mike Ogletree played on the first leg of the tour, but was asked to leave the band in November 1982, later joining [[Fiction Factory]].<ref name="NGT" /> Mel Gaynor was recruited for the remaining dates<ref name="NGT" /> and retained afterwards, eventually becoming the band's longest-standing drummer (and longest-standing member other than mainstays Burchill and Kerr) despite thrice leaving and returning in the following decades. The band's late 1982 UK dates included a show at City Hall in Newcastle that was recorded by Virgin and later included on the 2003 ''Seen the Lights'' DVD.<ref name="NGT" /> On these dates the band was supported by [[China Crisis]].<ref name="NGT" />

The second leg of the New Gold Dream tour started in March 1983 and included dates in Europe, USA and Canada. In July they performed at festivals such as [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark and [[Rock Werchter]] in Belgium.<ref name="NGT" /> Prior to the tour the band had started working on their next album. In August the new song "[[Waterfront (song)|Waterfront]]" was premiered in a live concert. In September the band recorded a BBC session for David Jensen, including "Waterfront" and the newly written "The Kick Inside of Me". In October their next album was recorded with producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] at [[Townhouse Studios]] in London. In November "Waterfront" was released as a single and the band embarked on their Sparkle in the Rain Tour. The opening show at Barrowlands Ballroom in Glasgow was filmed for the "Waterfront" video.<ref name="sm" /> "Waterfront" became their most successful single to date; hitting No.&nbsp;1 in New Zealand, No. 5 in Ireland, the Top 20 in Australia and Sweden, and No. 13 on the UK chart.<ref name="oc" />

''[[Sparkle in the Rain]]'' was released in February 1984.<ref name="Larkin"/> It entered the UK albums chart at number one.<ref name="oc" /> It was preceded by the single "[[Speed Your Love to Me]]" which reached No.20 on the singles chart.<ref name="oc" /> A third single from the album, "[[Up on the Catwalk]]", was subsequently released and also reached the Top 30 in the UK.<ref name="oc" /> ''Sparkle in the Rain'' hit the top 20 in several other countries (including Canada, where it reached No.&nbsp;13).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.6325a&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=kjerdnvbvl3a8p4jfufutrc7u6 |title=Item Display – RPM – Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |access-date=1 September 2011}}</ref> The band spent much of 1984 touring the world, including Australia, Europe, North America and Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/tours/t1983-1/index.htm |title=Sparkle in the Rain Tour |publisher=Dream Giver Redux}}</ref> In 1984, Jim Kerr married [[Chrissie Hynde]] of the [[Pretenders (band)|Pretenders]] (who renamed herself Christine Kerr).<ref name="Larkin"/> Simple Minds headlined a North American tour supported by [[China Crisis]] during the Canadian leg and supported the Pretenders in the US while Hynde was pregnant with Kerr's daughter. The marriage lasted until 1990.

====North American breakthrough====
[[File:Simple Minds at Live Aid, 1985.png|thumb|right|Simple Minds performing "[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]" at [[Live Aid]] from [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]], United States, 1985]] 

with the bands early popularity in the UK, Europe, Canada and Australia, Simple Minds was starting to crack the US charts in 1983. The band's UK releases on Arista were not picked up by Arista USA who had 'right of first refusal' for their releases but these releases were still played on American radio in 1983 and 1984. With The 1985 film ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'', it thrusted Simple Minds up into the top 10 of the US market, when the band achieved their only No.&nbsp;1 U.S. pop hit in April 1985 with the film's opening track, "[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]",<ref name="Larkin"/> a song written by [[Keith Forsey]] and Steve Schiff;<ref name="Larkin"/> which had previously been offered to [[Billy Idol]] and [[Bryan Ferry]] before Simple Minds agreed to record it. The song soon became a chart-topper in many other countries around the world.

At around this point, the camaraderie that had fuelled Simple Minds began to take a load on the band, and in time over the next ten years the band's line-up underwent frequent changes. Jim Kerr subsequently recalled "We were knackered. We were desensitized. The band started to fracture. We were lads who had grown up together, we were meant to grow together, politically, spiritually and artistically. But we were getting tired with each other. There was an element of the chore creeping in. We were coasting and this whole other thing was a challenge."<ref>Interview with Jim Kerr in ''Scottish Sunday Times'', 23 September 2001</ref> The first casualty was bassist Derek Forbes, who was beginning to squabble with Kerr. Forbes began failing to turn up for rehearsals, and was dismissed. Forbes remained in touch with the band (and was soon reunited with another former Simple Minds bandmate, drummer Brian McGee, in [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]]).

To replace Forbes, Simple Minds hired former [[Brand X]] bass player [[John Giblin]], who owned the band's rehearsal space and was a session musician who had worked with [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Kate Bush]]. Giblin made his debut with Simple Minds at [[Live Aid]] in [[Philadelphia]], where the band performed "Don't You (Forget About Me)", a new track called "[[Ghost Dancing (Simple Minds song)|Ghost Dancing]]" and "Promised You a Miracle".<ref>{{Cite web|date=13 July 1985|title=Simple Minds Play Live Aid - 1985|url=https://www.simpleminds.com/1985/07/13/simple-minds-play-live-aid-1985/|access-date=2 December 2020|website=SIMPLEMINDS.COM|language=en-GB}}</ref>

====''Once Upon a Time''====

During 1985, Simple Minds were in the studio with former [[Tom Petty]]/[[Stevie Nicks]] producer [[Jimmy Iovine]]. In November, ''[[Once Upon a Time (Simple Minds album)|Once Upon a Time]]'' was released;<ref name="Larkin"/> former [[Chic (band)|Chic]] singer [[Robin Clark]], who performed call-and-response vocals with Kerr throughout the album (effectively becoming a second lead singer), and was heavily featured in Simple Minds music videos of the time. The record reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK and No.&nbsp;10 in the US, despite the fact that their major-league breakthrough single "Don't You (Forget About Me)" was not included.<ref name="Larkin"/> ''Once Upon a Time'' went on to generate four worldwide hit singles: "Alive and Kicking", "Sanctify Yourself", "Ghost Dancing" and "All the Things She Said",<ref name="Larkin"/> the last of which featured a music video directed by [[Zbigniew Rybczyński]] that used techniques developed in music videos for bands such as [[Pet Shop Boys]] and [[Art of Noise]]. The band also toured, with both Robin Clark and percussionist Sue Hadjopoulos added to the live line-up.

Because of Simple Minds' powerful stage presence and lyrics that were now beginning to adopt [[Christian symbolism]], the band was criticised by some in the music press as a lesser version of [[U2]], despite the fact that both bands were now heading in different musical directions.<ref name="Larkin"/> The two groups were well-acquainted with one another, and [[Bono]] joined Simple Minds on-stage at the [[Barrowlands]] in Glasgow in 1985 for a live version of "New Gold Dream". Bono also appeared on stage at Simple Minds Croke Park concert and sang "Sun City" during the "Love Song" medley. Derek Forbes also appeared on stage at the Croke Park concert and performed on several songs during the encore. To document their worldwide ''Once Upon a Time Tour'', Simple Minds released the double-live set ''[[Live in the City of Light]]'' in May 1987,<ref name="Larkin"/> which was recorded primarily over two nights in Paris in August 1986.

===Continued success and hiatus (1988–1993)===
====Bonnie Wee Studio====
[[File:Mandela voting in 1994.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Simple Minds wrote the song "[[Mandela Day (song)|Mandela Day]]" as a homage to South African President [[Nelson Mandela]]]] 

By 1988, Simple Minds had built their own recording premises — the Bonnie Wee Studio — in Scotland. Following the lengthy period of touring to support ''Once Upon a Time'', the remaining core members (Kerr, Burchill and MacNeil) began new writing sessions in Scotland: Gaynor and Giblin pursued session work elsewhere while waiting to be called in. Initially the band began work on an instrumental project called ''Aurora Borealis'' (mostly written by Burchill and MacNeil). This project was then supplanted by an increase in the band's political activism, something which they had begun to stress in recent years (by giving all of the income from the "Ghostdancing" single to Amnesty International, and playing cover versions of Little Steven's "(Ain't Gonna Play) Sun City" on tour), inspired by [[Peter Gabriel]] with whom they had toured in the early 1980s.

Simple Minds were the first band to sign up for [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute|Mandela Day]], (which most of the band members now regret as this just made things worse in South Africa), a concert held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], London, as an expression of solidarity with the then-imprisoned [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref name="Larkin"/> Bands involved were asked to produce a song especially for the event – Simple Minds were the only act which produced one. This was "[[Mandela Day (song)|Mandela Day]]", which the band played live on the day (alongside cover versions of "Sun City" with Little Steven and a cover version of Peter Gabriel's "Biko" on which Gabriel himself took on lead vocals). "Mandela Day" was released on the ''Ballad of the Streets'' EP, which reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK Singles Chart (the only time the band did so).<ref>[http://www.theofficialcharts.com/search.php "Belfast Child" No.&nbsp;1 in UK Singles Chart] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729033254/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/search.php |date=29 July 2007 }}. Retrieved 19 August 2007.</ref> Another EP track, "[[Belfast Child]]", was a rewrite of the [[Celtic music|Celtic folk]] song "[[She Moved Through the Fair]]"<ref name="Larkin"/> (which had been introduced to Kerr by John Giblin) with new lyrics written about the ongoing conflict in Northern Ireland). The single was also an expression by Simple Minds of their support for the campaign for the release of [[Beirut]]-held hostage [[Brian Keenan (writer)|Brian Keenan]], kidnapped by the [[Islamic Jihad Organization|Islamic Jihad]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

====''Street Fighting Years''====

The next album ''[[Street Fighting Years]]'' (produced by [[Trevor Horn]] and [[Stephen Lipson]]) moved away from the American soul and gospel influences of ''Once Upon a Time'' in favour of soundtrack atmospherics and a new incorporation of acoustic and folk music-related ingredients. The lyrics were also more directly political, covering topics including the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Poll Tax]], the [[Soweto]] townships, the [[Berlin Wall]] and the stationing of nuclear submarines on the Scottish coast. The band underwent further line-up changes during the recording of ''Street Fighting Years''.<ref name="Larkin"/> Mel Gaynor and John Giblin both contributed to the recording (and, in Giblin's case, to some of the writing) but both had left the band by the time of the album's release, by which time the band was officially listed as a trio of Kerr, Burchill and MacNeil. In a new development for the band, various bass guitar and drum tracks were performed by high-profile guesting session musicians. Gaynor's departure from the band was brief (he was rehired for the following tour).

Released in 1989, the album rose to No.&nbsp;1 in the UK charts<ref>[http://www.theofficialcharts.com/search.php ''Street Fighting Years'' No.&nbsp;1 in UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729033254/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/search.php |date=29 July 2007 }}. Retrieved 19 August 2007.</ref> and received a rare five-star review from ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine. It received a less positive review in ''Rolling Stone'' which criticised the band for what the reviewer considered to be political vacuity.  "This Is Your Land" was chosen as the lead single for the U.S., and even with guest vocals from [[Lou Reed]], the single failed to make a mark on the pop charts. Reunited with Mel Gaynor, Simple Minds hired Malcolm Foster (ex-[[Pretenders (band)|Pretenders]]) as the new bass player, following a failed attempt to re-recruit Derek Forbes (who declined due to family reasons and a lack of affinity with the new music).<ref>[https://postpunkmonk.com/2023/11/20/simple-minds-bassist-extraordinaire-derek-forbes-unleashes-his-autobiography/ "Simple Minds’ Bassist Extraordinaire Derek Forbes Unleashes His Autobiography"] - review in ''Post Punk Monk'', 20 November 2023</ref><ref>[https://crazyonclassicrock.com/2024/01/05/book-review-a-very-simple-mind-on-tour-by-derek-forbes/ "Book Review: A Very Simple Mind: On Tour by Derek Forbes"] - review in ''Crazy on Classic Rock'' by angiemoonthemod, 5 January 2024</ref> The live band was once again expanded by recruiting three additional touring members: Level 42 backing singer Annie McCaig, percussionist Andy Duncan and violinist [[Lisa Germano]]. Touring began in May 1989, and included the first and only time that the group headlined [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]],<ref>{{cite web |website=WembleyStadium.com|title=Wembley Stadium Concerts history|url=http://www.wembleystadium.com/GloriousPast/greatmemories/stadiumConcerts/stadium+concert+artists.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109022230/http://www.wembleystadium.com/GloriousPast/greatmemories/stadiumConcerts/stadium+concert+artists.htm|archive-date=9 January 2011|access-date=26 September 2011}}</ref> where they were supported by fellow Scottish bands [[The Silencers (band)|The Silencers]], [[Texas (band)|Texas]] and [[Gun (band)|Gun]]. In September, the concert in the Roman amphitheatre [[Verona Arena]] in Italy was recorded for the live video ''Verona'', released by Virgin in 1990, and later included on the ''Seen the Lights'' DVD in 2003.

At the end of the Street Fighting Years tour, Simple Minds laid plans to go to Amsterdam to begin recording a new album. Just before the end of the tour, keyboardist Michael MacNeil announced to the band that he would not be joining them as he needed a break. MacNeil played his last concert with Simple Minds in Brisbane a week later. At the time, MacNeil's departure was put down to health concerns, but he had been gradually suffering disillusionment with the band's lifestyle and touring schedule (as well as what Kerr has referred to as "a number of animated quarrels".<ref name="diary">[https://www.simpleminds.com/2009/12/01/the-spirit-of-macneil/ "The Spirit of MacNeil"] (Jim Kerr online diary entry on Simple Minds website, dated 1 December 2009)</ref>) At around the same time, long-term manager Bruce Findlay was dismissed and over the next few years the band gradually altered to the point where it was a shifting set of musicians around the only remaining core members, Kerr and Burchill.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} In December 2009, Kerr retrospectively defended the changes in an online diary entry, although he said that MacNeil's departure had been a "colossal fracture". He also paid tribute to his former bandmate and said that MacNeil had been irreplaceable.<ref name="diary" /> 

Simple Minds continued to record, hiring keyboard players as and where required. The first of these was session keyboard player [[Peter-John Vettese]] who played live with the band at the Nelson Mandela Freedom Concert and on a short German tour. He was subsequently replaced in the live band by Mark Taylor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

====''Real Life'' and hiatus====

In 1991, Simple Minds returned with ''[[Real Life (Simple Minds album)|Real Life]]''. The album's cover showed a trio of Kerr, Burchill and Gaynor and the writing credits for all songs was Kerr/Burchill.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK, where it also spawned four Top 40 singles. In the US, "[[See the Lights]]" was the band's last Top 40 pop single. The band toured to support the release, playing as a basic five-piece (Kerr, Burchill, Gaynor, Foster and Taylor) and cutting down on the extended arrangements of the last few large tours. Mel Gaynor left the band in 1992 to pursue session work and other projects, and for the next two years Simple Minds were on hiatus, releasing the compilation album ''[[Glittering Prize 81/92]]'' in 1992.

===Return from hiatus (1994–1999)===
====''Good News from the Next World''====
[[File:Simple Minds live in 1995.png|thumb|left|Simple Minds performing at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in [[Paris]], France, October 1995]] 
Simple Minds returned to activity later in 1994. By now the band was officially a duo of Kerr and Burchill (with the latter taking on keyboards in the studio, as well as guitar). Hiring Keith Forsey (the writer of "Don't You (Forget About Me)") as producer, they began to put together an album which returned to the uplifting arena rock feel of their ''Once Upon a Time'' days. With Gaynor now out of the picture, the remaining instrumentation was covered by session musicians (although Malcolm Foster was included among the bass players used for recording). ''[[Good News from the Next World]]'' was released in 1995.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK and produced the Top 10 hit "[[She's a River]]" and the Top 20 single "Hypnotised". The band toured to promote ''Good News from the Next World'', with Malcolm Foster and Mark Taylor as touring bass and keyboard players and Mark Schulman (who had played on the album) on drums. This was Foster's last work with the band, and Schulman returned to session work at the end of the tour.

After being released from their contract with [[Virgin Records]], Simple Minds made use of the skills of their original rhythm section, Derek Forbes and Brian McGee (returning after respective eleven- and fourteen-year absences). Although McGee was not involved beyond the rehearsal stage, Forbes formally rejoined Simple Minds in July 1996. The band then reunited with Mel Gaynor for a studio session in early 1997. Gaynor was reinstated as a full-time member for the European tour (which once again featured Mark Taylor on keyboards). After the tour, album recording sessions were interrupted by Kerr and Burchill's decision to play live (without Forbes, Taylor or Gaynor) as part of the Proms tour (a series of orchestral concerts featuring a mixture of light classical and pop music). The duo played versions of "Alive And Kicking", "Belfast Child" and "Don't You (Forget About Me)" backed by a full orchestra and were billed as Simple Minds.

====Chrysalis Records and ''Néapolis''====

The new album, ''[[Néapolis (album)|Néapolis]]'' featured Forbes playing bass guitar on all tracks, and Gaynor on one song, "War Babies". Other drum tracks were recorded by session players Michael Niggs and Jim McDermott, with additional percussion programming by [[Transglobal Underground]]/[[Furniture (band)|Furniture]] drummer Hamilton Lee. It was the only Simple Minds album released by [[Chrysalis Records]], who refused to release the album in the U.S., citing lack of interest. The music video for "Glitterball", the album's lead single, was the first production of any kind to film at the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|Guggenheim Museum]] in [[Bilbao]], Spain. A European tour followed between March and July 1998, undermined by problems with ill-health and contractual fiascos (including a pull-out from the Fleadh Festival to be replaced by British [[Rock music|rock]] band [[James (band)|James]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2025}}

As Simple Minds' main writing team, Kerr and Burchill had continued to demo and originate material by themselves. For the latest sessions they had shared studio space with a band called Sly Silver Sly who featured Jim Kerr's brother Mark (previously the drummer with [[Gun (band)|Gun]]) and bass guitarist Eddie Duffy, and who were working with American songwriter Kevin Hunter. While in the studio, the two writing and recording projects (including the Hunter co-writes) merged to become the sessions for the next Simple Minds album, ''[[Silver Box#Disc 5: Our Secrets Are the Same|Our Secrets Are the Same]]''. Once again, Forbes and Gaynor found themselves out of the band: Mark Kerr became the new drummer and Eddie Duffy joined on bass guitar. The new-look Simple Minds made their début with a short set of greatest hits at the Scotland Rocks For Kosovo festival, with Mark Taylor returning on keyboards. The displaced Forbes and Gaynor, having apparently been told that the band was not appearing at the festival, formed a new band of their own to play the same concert.{{citation needed|date=July 2025}}

===Second hiatus, return and decline (1999–2005)===

Having delivered ''[[Silver Box#Disc 5: Our Secrets Are the Same|Our Secrets Are the Same]]'' to Chrysalis, Simple Minds then found themselves caught up in record company politics while Chrysalis, [[EMI]] and other companies attempted to merge with each other. Originally due for release in late 1999, the album remained unreleased after the band mired themselves in lawsuits with Chrysalis. In 2000, the situation became even more complicated when ''Our Secrets Are the Same'' was leaked on the internet. Discouraged with their label's failure to resolve the problems, and with both momentum and potential album sales lost, the band once again went on hiatus. Eddie Duffy, Mark Taylor and Mark Kerr all moved on to other projects. Jim Kerr moved to Sicily and took up a part-time career as a hotelier, although both he and Burchill continued working together on various business interests and kept the idea of the band alive.{{citation needed|date=July 2025}}

In 2001, Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill began working with [[multi-instrumentalist]] Gordon Goudie (ex-[[The Primevals (band)|Primevals]]) on a new Simple Minds album to be called ''[[Cry (Simple Minds album)|Cry]]''. Mark Kerr also contributed to the project (this time as an acoustic guitarist and Burchill's co-writer on several songs) while Kerr brought in various Italian musicians as collaborators, including Planet Funk and Punk Investigation. In parallel to ''Cry'', Simple Minds also recorded an album of covers called ''[[Neon Lights (album)|Neon Lights]]'', featuring Simple Minds versions of songs from artists including [[Patti Smith]], [[Roxy Music]] and [[Kraftwerk]]. ''Neon Lights'' was the first to be completed and released (later in 2001). In the video for the ''Neon Lights'' single "Dancing Barefoot", the band consisted of Jim Kerr, Charlie Burchill, Gordon Goudie and Mark Kerr. A 2-CD compilation, ''[[The Best of Simple Minds]]'', was released soon afterwards.

''[[Cry (Simple Minds album)|Cry]]'' was released in April 2002. Although the album did not sell in great numbers in the U.S., Simple Minds felt confident enough to mount a North American leg of their Floating World tour (named after the instrumental track which closes ''Cry''), their first in seven years. With Goudie opting to remain studio bound (and Mark Kerr leaving the band again), Simple Minds once again recruited Mel Gaynor as tour drummer. The live band was completed by the returning Eddie Duffy on bass guitar and by new keyboard player/programmer Andy Gillespie (of SoundControl). On 28 October 2003, Capitol released ''Seen The Lights – A Visual History'', the first-ever Simple Minds commercial (double) DVD, featuring over four hours and twenty minutes of archive footage. The first disc includes the majority of the band's promotional videos. The second disc is devoted to ''Verona'', the band's first live home video release, which was originally released in VHS format in 1990. It was upmixed to 5.1 surround sound for the DVD, but otherwise remains the same as the original VHS copy. 

On 18 October 2004, Simple Minds released a five-CD compilation entitled ''[[Silver Box]]''. This mostly comprised previously unreleased demos, radio and TV sessions and live recordings from 1979 to 1995, but also included the long-delayed ''[[Silver Box#Disc 5: Our Secrets Are the Same|Our Secrets Are the Same]]''. In July 2005, the band embarked on the "Intimate Tour", a series of low-key European and UK gigs at smaller venues which ended in December 2005. Andy Gillespie was unable to appear at all the gigs, and Mark Taylor returned to cover for him on several occasions. From this point onwards, the two alternated as Simple Minds' live keyboard player, depending on Gillespie's schedule with his other projects.

===Return to prominence (2005–2009)===
[[File:Simple Minds.jpg|thumb|left|Frontman Jim Kerr performing with Simple Minds, 2006]] 

With the Kerr/Burchill/Duffy/Gaynor lineup, Simple Minds released ''[[Black & White 050505]]'' (their fourteenth studio album), on 12 September 2005. The album's first single, "Home", received airplay on alternative rock radio stations in the US. It reached No.&nbsp;37 in the UK and was not released in North America. The band spent 2006 touring throughout Europe, the Far East, Australia and New Zealand on the Black And White Tour (with Mark Taylor on keyboards).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpleminds.org/sm/tours/t2006/index.htm |title=Black and White Tour 2006 |publisher=Dream Giver Redux}}</ref>
