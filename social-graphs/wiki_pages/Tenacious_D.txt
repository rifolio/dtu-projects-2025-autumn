Black and Gass eventually wrote their first song after Black was dumped by a girlfriend, a non-comedic song.

Gass told Black that they could not write the best song in the world, but Black put a twist on it and said they could "write a tribute". Gass played an A-minor chord on his guitar at the apartment and the two spent three days crafting the song. When it was done, Gass said they "knew they had something". The song made the duo realize their comedic potential.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Guitarings/videos/vb.115431963700/10100946341944973/?type=3&theater|title=Guitarings|website=Facebook.com|language=en|access-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref> The duo briefly called themselves Responsive Chord while rehearsing the comedy act.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Deville |first1=Chris |title=''Tenacious D'' Turns 20 |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2161666/tenacious-d-turns-20/reviews/the-anniversary/ |website=Stereogum |access-date=June 14, 2024 |language=en |date=September 24, 2021}}</ref>

===Rise to popularity===
The band's first on-stage appearance was at Highland Grounds in Los Angeles, a coffee shop, where they performed as ''The Axe Lords Featuring Gorgazon's Mischief,'' though the production was technically part of a variety event for the Actor's Gang''.<ref name="kerrang.com" />'' In the audience was the actor and comedian [[Harry Shearer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/let-it-d-tenacious-d-the-greatest-band-in-the-world-or-maybe-the-second-gre/|title=Let It D: Tenacious D, The Greatest Band in the World (or Maybe the Second Greatest, They're Still W|date=February 3, 2012|website=Relix.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 27, 2019}}</ref>

Tenacious D continued to generate momentum on the Los Angeles music scene, notably performing headline shows at Al's Bar, Pedro's, [[Largo (nightclub)|Largo]] and The Actors' Gang studio. [[Maynard James Keenan]], lead vocalist of the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]], had also met Cross on the Los Angeles scene, and therefore had also become involved in ''Mr. Show''.

Grohl changed his stance and went to see the band perform a couple of weeks later and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Tenacious D recorded their songs "Tribute", "Kyle Quit the Band", "Krishna" and "History" and released them in a demo tape called ''Tenacious Demo'' in the late 1990s with Andrew Gross. They distributed it to various record companies until HBO offered them a TV show based on the tape and Black's work on ''Mr. Show''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Tenacious-D-Demo-/release/2862109 |title=Discogs, Tenacious Demo, 1997 |year=1994 |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=April 12, 2012}}</ref>

{{Main|Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny}}
Black and Gass had dreamt of producing a Tenacious D motion-picture since forming the band; archived footage of banter at an early Tenacious D show records Black as saying "a movie - that would be the pinnacle".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2012/05/gods-of-rock-in-their-own-minds-the-early-days-of-tenacious-d.html|title=Gods of Rock (In Their Own Minds): The Early Days of Tenacious D|first=Cameron|last=Tung|date=May 16, 2012|website=Vulture.com}}</ref>

The duo conceptualized numerous ideas for a film, though the first actual known draft of a script was published on November 7, 2000. The script was based on many songs that would later be released on [[Tenacious D (album)|the duo's eponymous debut album]] that would be released the following year. There is little known about the script, other than it being based around the band playing coffee shops and Black becoming fascinated by [[Atlantis]]. Black and Gass both fall in love with a girl called Simmeon who has written books about the fictional island. They later meet Ronnie James Dio, and are sent on a road trip to Miami. This concept was later scrapped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tenaciousjoes.com/tenaciousdmovie.html|title=Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny|date=June 3, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603003749/http://www.tenaciousjoes.com/tenaciousdmovie.html|access-date=November 16, 2019|archive-date=June 3, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tenaciousjoes.com/tenaciousdmoviescript.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20051230145940/http://www.tenaciousjoes.com/tenaciousdmoviescript.html|url-status=dead|title=Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny|archive-date=December 30, 2005|access-date=March 16, 2014}}</ref>

On March 26, 2012, a 6-minute film was uploaded to the Tenacious D channel on YouTube. The mockumentary, titled 'Tenacious D - To Be the Best', documents the uncertain future Tenacious D faced after the box-office failure of ''The Pick of Destiny'', KG's subsequent breakdown and incarceration in "an institution", and Jack's embracing of an indulgent Hollywood lifestyle. The film shows a deranged Kyle escaping the facility and attempting to kill Jack and then himself, before they each realize their importance to each other and revive the band. They produce a new album in 75 minutes in the studio, described as "awful", but try again and emerge with another new album, described at the end of the film as "the greatest album recorded by anyone, ever". The film features numerous cameo appearances, including [[Maria Menounos]], [[Val Kilmer]], Dave Grohl, [[Yoshiki Hayashi]], [[Josh Groban]], Richard Ghagan, [[Mike White (filmmaker)|Mike White]], [[Tim Robbins]] and [[Jimmy Kimmel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nai7w1frB1E | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211102/nai7w1frB1E| archive-date=November 2, 2021 | url-status=live|title=Tenacious D - To Be The Best | date=March 26, 2012|via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=April 26, 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

The band spent the first twelve years of their career playing acoustic concerts; just Black and Gass on acoustic guitars, with no backing instruments apart from occasional guests. Black and Gass have expressed angst they experience before concerts saying: "We're always looking for a loophole. Pretty much every concert we've ever done, we're trying to find a way to cancel the show at the last minute."<ref name="Relix" /> The band mainly spent their first five years performing in Los Angeles, with occasional concerts in New York and Colorado. The band embarked on their first ever tour in 1999. In 2001, Tenacious D started their second nationwide [[Concert|concert tour]], performing at larger venues, many of which sold out.<ref name="AMG" /> In 2001, Black and Gass toured with [[Weezer]] alongside [[Jimmy Eat World]], performing in large arenas. In 2002, the band supported [[Kid Rock]] at a handful of concerts, before starting their third domestic tour, ''Le Tour!'', playing many medium-sized theaters. Later that year and in early 2003, the band would perform three small European tours, and an Australian tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/concert-map/tenacious-d-2bd6d4ae.html|title=Tenacious D Concert Map|website=Setlist.fm|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref>

In 2006, the band launched their first ever major tour, [[The Pick of Destiny Tour (2006–2007)|The Pick of Destiny Tour]]. Black and Gass wished to recruit electric guitarist [[John Konesky]] and bassist [[John Spiker]], both members of Gass's side-project [[Trainwreck with Kyle Gass|Trainwreck]], and had been session musicians on ''The Pick of Destiny'' album. The band also wished to recruit drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]] from [[The Vandals]]. At early rehearsals of the tour, Black and Gass contemplated whether to go ahead with the musicians, or whether to continue performing acoustic, of which they decided to try the tour with the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080923006620/en/TENACIOUS-Set-Release-COMPLETE-MASTERWORKS-2-DVD|title=TENACIOUS D Set to Release THE COMPLETE MASTERWORKS 2 DVD on November 4|date=September 23, 2008|publisher=Businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The tour would continue into 2007, with two US legs, a European leg and an Australian leg.

Apart from two performances in Stockholm and Amsterdam, until 2012, the band had never performed to non-English speaking countries. Black claimed it was because foreign concerts were "a little funky" because "the subtleties do get lost in translation".<ref name="Relix" /> In June, the band would perform at [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]] festivals in Germany, which broke the band's attendance records. In October, the band embarked on a large tour of Europe, including returns to Germany.{{citation needed|date=February 2024}}

Following the Rize of the Fenix Tour, the band toured smaller venues as ''Old School Acoustic Style Tour'' in early 2013, performing in North America and Australia.
