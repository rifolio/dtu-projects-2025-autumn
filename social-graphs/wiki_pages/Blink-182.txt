Its current and most widely recognized line-up consists of bassist and vocalist [[Mark Hoppus]], guitarist and vocalist [[Tom DeLonge]], and drummer [[Travis Barker]]. Though its sound has diversified throughout their career, its musical style, described as [[pop-punk]], blends catchy [[pop music|pop]] melodies with fast-paced [[punk rock]]. Its lyrics primarily focus on relationships, adolescent frustration, and maturity, or lack thereof. The group emerged from a suburban, [[Punk rock in California|Southern California skate punk scene]] and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent humor.

The band's debut, ''[[Cheshire Cat (Blink-182 album)|Cheshire Cat]]'', and second studio album, ''[[Dude Ranch (album)|Dude Ranch]]'', were released in 1995 and 1997 respectively, through independent imprint Grilled Cheese, a subdivision of [[Cargo Music|Cargo Records]]. These releases helped the band gain moderate success around the local San Diego punk scene and abroad (namely Australia), which brought attention from major labels amid the punk rock resurgence on a mainstream scale post-''[[Dookie]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Green Day's Dookie Fertilized A Punk Rock Revival|work=idobi |date=September 16, 2004|url=https://idobi.com/news/how-green-days-dookie-fertilized-a-punkrock-revival/}}</ref> After years of independent recording and touring, including stints on the [[Warped Tour]], the group signed to [[MCA Records]]. Its third and fourth albums—''[[Enema of the State]]'' (1999) and ''[[Take Off Your Pants and Jacket]]'' (2001)—had the greatest commercial success while the singles "[[All the Small Things]]", "[[Dammit]]", and "[[What's My Age Again?]]" became [[hit song]]s and [[MTV]] staples. Later efforts, including [[blink-182 (album)|an untitled album]] (2003), ''[[Neighborhoods (Blink-182 album)|Neighborhoods]]'' (2011), and an [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Dogs Eating Dogs]]'' (2012), marked stylistic shifts. Hoppus is the only member to remain in the band throughout its history. DeLonge left the group twice, a decade apart, before returning again. Founding drummer [[Scott Raynor]] recorded and toured with the group before being dismissed in 1998 and replaced by Barker. During DeLonge's absence from 2015 to 2022, the band included [[Alkaline Trio]] singer and guitarist [[Matt Skiba]], with whom it recorded two albums, ''[[California (Blink-182 album)|California]]'' (2016), and ''[[Nine (Blink-182 album)|Nine]]'' (2019), and toured in support of both. Their ninth album, ''[[One More Time...]]'', was released on October 20, 2023.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=2023-09-18 |title=blink-182 Announce Track List, Release Date for 'One More Time...'

==History==
===Formation and initial years (1992–1994)===
[[File:Blink-182 at the Gorilla Pit in October 1993.jpg|left|thumb|Blink at the Gorilla Pit in 1993]]
Blink-182 was formed in August 1992 in [[Poway, California]], a northern [[suburb]] of [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]]. Guitarist [[Tom DeLonge]] was expelled from [[Poway High School]] for being drunk at a basketball game and was forced to attend another school, [[Rancho Bernardo High School]], for one semester. There, he performed at a Battle of the Bands competition, where he was introduced to drummer [[Scott Raynor]].<ref name="lat95">{{cite news|last=Roos|first=John|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-12-21-ca-16336-story.html|title=OC LIVE : POP MUSIC : Punk Evolution: Blink-182 Adds Melody, Humor|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 21, 1995|access-date=May 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526000530/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-21/entertainment/ca-16336_1_pop-music|archive-date=May 26, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ut">{{cite news|title=With a wink to a sound that's fast, fun, Blink set to run for the tundra|first=Mikel|last=Toombs|work=[[San Diego Union Tribune]]|date=March 30, 1995}}</ref> He also befriended Kerry Key, who was also interested in punk rock music. Key was dating Anne Hoppus, sister of bassist [[Mark Hoppus]], who had recently moved from [[Ridgecrest, California]], to work at a [[record store]] and attend college. Both Hoppus and DeLonge grew up listening to punk rock music, with both particularly enamoured by bands like [[Screeching Weasel]] and [[the Descendents]].<ref name=totalguitar/><ref name="rb"/> [[Southern California]] had a large punk population in the early 1990s, aided by an active surfing, skating, and snowboarding scene.<ref name="p18shoo"/> In contrast to [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] punk music, the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] wave of groups typically introduced more melodic aspects.<ref name="p18shoo"/> "New York is gloomy, dark and cold.

Anne introduced her brother to DeLonge on August 2, 1992.<ref name=p8-9>Hoppus, 2001. pp. 8–9</ref> The pair instantly connected and played for hours in DeLonge's garage, exchanging lyrics and co-writing songs—one of which became fan favorite "[[Carousel (Blink-182 song)|Carousel]]".<ref name="p8-9"/> Hoppus, hoping to impress DeLonge, fell from a lamppost in front of DeLonge's home and cracked his ankles, putting him on crutches for three weeks.<ref name=p10shoo>Shooman, 2010. pp.&nbsp;10–11</ref> The trio began to practice together in Raynor's bedroom, spending time writing music, seeing movies and punk concerts, and playing practical jokes.<ref name=p10-11>Hoppus, 2001. pp.&nbsp;10–11</ref> The trio first operated under a variety of names, including Duck Tape<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/on1080216036 |title=Rock chronicles: every legend, every line-up, every look |date=2019 |publisher=Firefly Books |isbn=978-0-2281-0159-8 |editor-last=Roberts |editor-first=David |edition=Third |location=Richmond Hill, Ontario |pages=72 |oclc=on1080216036}}</ref> and Figure 8, until DeLonge rechristened the band "Blink".<ref name=p13shoo>Shooman, 2010. pp.&nbsp;13–14</ref> Hoppus' girlfriend of the time was annoyed by his constant attention to the band, and demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band not long after its formation.<ref name=p13-15>Hoppus, 2001. pp. 13–15</ref> Shortly thereafter, DeLonge and Raynor borrowed a [[Multitrack recording|four-track recorder]] from friend and collaborator Cam Jones and were preparing to record a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]], with Jones on bass.<ref name="p13shoo"/> Hoppus promptly broke up with his girlfriend and returned to the band.<ref name="p13-15"/> ''Flyswatter''—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor's bedroom in May 1993.<ref name=p16>Hoppus, 2001. p. 16</ref>
[[File:Early Blink-182 show at the Soul Kitchen.jpg|thumb|Blink-182 performing in 1993|left]]
The band began booking shows, and were on stage nearly every weekend, even at [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodges]] and [[YMCA]] centres.<ref name="p21"/> DeLonge constantly called clubs in San Diego asking for a spot to play, as well as local high schools, convincing them that Blink was a "motivational band with a strong [[Just Say No|antidrug]] message" in hopes to play at an assembly or lunch.<ref name=p21>Hoppus, 2001. p. 21-23</ref> San Diego at this time was "hardly a hotbed of [musical] activity", according to journalist Joe Shooman and the band's popularity grew as did punk rock concurrently in the mainstream.<ref name="p16"/> They quickly became part of a circuit that also included bands such as [[Ten Foot Pole]] and [[Unwritten Law]], and Blink soon found its way onto the bill as the opening band for acts performing at [[Soma San Diego|Soma]], a local all-ages venue. "The biggest dreams we ever had when we started was to [headline] a show at Soma", Hoppus said later.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Q&A: Mark Hoppus of Blink-182|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-mark-hoppus-of-blink-182-231197/|date=February 5, 2004|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=Austin|last=Scaggs|access-date=December 31, 2019|archive-date=December 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231055445/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/qa-mark-hoppus-of-blink-182-231197/|url-status=live}}</ref> Meanwhile, Hoppus' manager at the record store, Patrick Secor, fronted the group money to properly record another demo at a local studio Doubletime.<ref name=p24-27>Hoppus, 2001. pp. 24–27</ref> The result was ''[[Buddha (album)|Buddha]]'' (1994), which the members of the band viewed as the band's first legitimate release.<ref name="p15shoo"/><ref name=p24-27/> That year, however, Raynor's family relocated to [[Reno, Nevada]], and he was briefly replaced by musician Mike Krull.<ref name=shooman24>Shooman, 2010. p. 24</ref> The band saved money and began flying Raynor out to shows, and he eventually moved back and in with Hoppus in mid-1995.

The heart of the local independent music scene was [[Cargo Music|Cargo Records]], which offered to sign the band on a "trial basis", with help from [[Otis Barthoulameu|O]], guitarist for local punk band [[Fluf]], and Brahm Goodis, a friend of the band whose father was president of the label.<ref name=p29>Hoppus, 2001. p. 29</ref> Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a [[Minor (law)|minor]].<ref name=p30>Hoppus, 2001. p. 30</ref> The band recorded their debut album—''[[Cheshire Cat (Blink-182 album)|Cheshire Cat]]'', released in February 1995—in three days at [[Westbeach Recorders]] in [[Los Angeles]], fueled by both new songs and re-recordings of songs from previous demos.<ref name=p31>Hoppus, 2001. p. 31</ref> "[[M+M's]]", the band's first single, garnered local radio airplay from [[XETRA-FM|91X]], and Cargo offered the band a small budget to film a music video for it.<ref name=p35-36>Hoppus, 2001. pp.&nbsp;35–36</ref> Meanwhile, the record also drew the attention of Irish band [[Blink (band)|Blink]]. Unwilling to engage in a legal battle, the band agreed to change their name.<ref name="p39"/> Cargo gave the band a week, but the trio put off the decision for more than two afterward. Eventually, Cargo called the trio, demanding that they "change the name or [we'll] change it for you", after which the band decided on a random number, 182.<ref name=name>{{Cite episode |title=Episode 4–4–11 |series=Hoppus on Music |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPJMUzMrFP0 |network=Fuse |airdate=April 14, 2011 |season=2 |access-date=December 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922171538/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPJMUzMrFP0 |archive-date=September 22, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="rstruth">{{cite magazine |last=Edwards |first=Gavin |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-half-naked-truth-about-blink-182-20000803 |title=Blink-182: The Half-Naked Truth |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=August 3, 2000 |access-date=July 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203033034/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-half-naked-truth-about-blink-182-20000803 |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The band soon hired a manager, Rick DeVoe, who had worked with larger bands such as [[NOFX]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] and [[the Offspring]].<ref name=p39>Hoppus, 2001. p. 39</ref> In addition, the group drew the attention of Rick and Jean Bonde of the Tahoe booking agency, who were responsible for "spreading the name of the band far and wide".<ref name="p39"/><ref name=shooman32>Shooman, 2010. pp.&nbsp;32–33</ref> In late 1995, the trio embarked on their first national tour, promoting the surf video ''Good Times'' with Unwritten Law, [[Sprung Monkey]] and [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]]. ''Good Times'' was directed by filmmaker [[Taylor Steele (filmmaker)|Taylor Steele]], who was a friend of DeVoe. In preparation for the trek, the band members purchased their own tour van, which they nicknamed the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.<ref name=p44>Hoppus, 2001. p. 44</ref> The ''Good Times'' tour extended outside the States with a leg in [[Australia]]; the trio were financially unable to go, but Pennywise's members paid for their plane tickets.<ref name=p52-53>Hoppus, 2001. pp.&nbsp;52–53</ref> [[Fletcher Dragge]], guitarist of Pennywise, believed in the band strongly. He demanded that [[Kevin Lyman]], founder of the traveling rock-based [[Warped Tour]], sign the band for its 1996 iteration, predicting they would become "gigantic".<ref name="onenineninefour">{{cite AV media | people=[[Jai Al-Attas|Al-Attas, Jai]] (Director) | year=2009 | title=[[One Nine Nine Four]] | medium=Motion picture | location=US| publisher=Robot Academy}}</ref> That year, the band toured heavily, with several domestic shows on and off the Warped Tour, trips to Canada and Japan, and more Australian dates. Australia was particularly receptive to the band and their humorous stage antics, which gained the band a reputation, but also made them ostracized and considered a joke.<ref name="nyt"/><ref name="MTV influence"/>

By March 1996, the trio began to accumulate a genuine buzz among major labels, resulting in a bidding war between [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], [[MCA Records|MCA]] and [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]].<ref name=shooman37>Shooman, 2010. p. 37</ref> MCA promised the group complete artistic freedom and ultimately signed the band,<ref name=p64>Hoppus, 2001. p. 64</ref> but Raynor held a great affinity for Epitaph and began to feel half-invested in the band when they chose MCA.<ref name=shooman55>Shooman, 2010. p. 55</ref> The group, discouraged by Cargo's lack of distribution and faith in the group, held no qualms about signing to a major label but were fiercely criticized in the punk community.<ref name="shooman37"/><ref name=p44.1>Footman, 2002. p. 44</ref><ref name=p61>Hoppus, 2001. p. 61</ref> After nonstop touring, the trio began recording their follow-up LP, ''[[Dude Ranch (album)|Dude Ranch]]'', over the period of a month in late 1996 with producer [[Mark Trombino]].<ref name=p69>Hoppus, 2001. p. 69</ref> The record was released the following June, and the band headed out on the 1997 Warped Tour.

==Public image==
Over the band's career, the public image of Blink-182 has evolved with their sound. Whereas other punk acts emerged from sometimes dangerous urban environments, Blink-182 professed a love for their upbringing in the suburbs—"beige little boxes in a row", Hoppus extolled in one song.<ref name="Mathews 2016 k124">{{cite web | last=Mathews | first=Joe | title=Blink-182, Jerry Brown sing different California songs | website=San Diego Union-Tribune | date=July 22, 2016 | url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/commentary/sdut-california-blink182-politicians-2016jul22-story.html | access-date=February 18, 2024}}</ref> "They weren't selling out; they were buying in," observed [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] critic Jeremy Gordon.

British publication ''[[NME]]'' was particularly critical, with reviewer Steven Wells comparing them to "that sanitized, castrated, shrink-wrapped '[[New wave music|new wave]]' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on the 'punk' bandwagon."<ref name=nme>{{cite magazine |last=Wells |first=Steven |date=June 18, 2001 |title=''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'': Review |magazine=[[NME]] |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/5230  |location=[[London]] |issn=1049-0434 |access-date=February 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202233519/http://www.nme.com/reviews/5230 |archive-date=February 2, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A 2001 [[Federal Trade Commission]] report condemned the [[entertainment industry]] for marketing lewd lyrics to American youth, specifically naming Blink-182 as among the most explicit acts.<ref name="Burr 2001 m610">{{cite magazine | last=Burr | first=Ty | title=The FTC raps the music industry's knuckles | magazine=Entertainment Weekly | date=April 30, 2001 | url=https://ew.com/article/2001/04/30/ftc-raps-music-industrys-knuckles/ | access-date=February 18, 2024}}</ref><ref name="Adweek 2001 q725">{{cite web | title=Adult Music Pitched To Kids: FTC | website=Adweek | date=April 25, 2001 | url=https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/adult-music-pitched-kids-ftc-48258/ | access-date=February 18, 2024}}</ref> Their goofy public image and juvenilia also found detractors.

The band's conventional appeal, as well as partnerships with MTV, [[boardsport]] companies, and clothing brands, led to accusations that they were betraying the independent spirit of punk rock.<ref name="spin99">{{cite book|last=Rotter|first=Jeffery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjh_OmCmm-0C&q=blink+182&pg=PA118|title=Naughty by Nature|publisher=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 1999|access-date=September 7, 2012|archive-date=August 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210828052327/https://books.google.com/books?id=yjh_OmCmm-0C&q=blink+182&pg=PA118|url-status=live}}</ref> The band were considered sellouts from the underground punk scene as early as 1996, when they first partnered with music conglomerate UMG.

"Many of Blink's best songs endure because they turn inward: the lovelorn boy has sense enough to wonder what's wrong with ''him''," observed Kelefa Sanneh.<ref name="newyorker16"/> To this end, the band has also been examined through a [[homosocial]] lens, with the band's internal drama and the friendship between DeLonge and Hoppus scrutinized in this light: "A [[queer]] reading of Blink-182 may almost be too obvious to make," admitted Spencer Kornhaber of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', "but playing with and panicking at the idea of being gay was actually vital to the band's identity [...] the guys' [brotherhood] is part of what inspires "[[Shipping (fandom)|shipping]]" blogs and slash [[fanfiction]]."<ref name="Kornhaber 2015 f063">{{cite web | last=Kornhaber | first=Spencer | title=Blink-182's Beautiful, Twisted, Kind of Gay Romance | website=The Atlantic | date=January 29, 2015 | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/01/blink-182/384936/ | access-date=February 18, 2024}}</ref>

Blink-182 was one of the most popular rock bands at the turn of the millennium, and spearheaded the second wave of [[pop-punk]] and its journey into the mainstream.<ref name=rsency>Romanowski, Patricia.

The band's glossy production instantly set them apart from the other crossover punk acts of the era, such as [[Green Day]].<ref name="nyt" /> Its third LP ''Enema of the State'' catapulted the band to stardom, creating what ''New York''{{'s}} Abebe described as a "blanket immersion among America's twenty-some million teenagers."<ref name="newyork" /> At the band's commercial peak, albums such as ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'' and ''Enema '' sold over 14 and 15 million copies worldwide, respectively.<ref name="MTV influence" /><ref name="sdreader">{{cite news |last=Leighton |first=Ken |date=September 14, 2011 |title=Naming Rights |newspaper=[[San Diego Reader]] |url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2011/sep/14/blurt1/ |access-date=February 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927074908/http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2011/sep/14/blurt1/ |archive-date=September 27, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> According to [[Kelefa Sanneh]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Blink-182 "spawned more imitators than any American rock band since [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].

Despite this, the band never received particularly glowing reviews, with many reviewers dismissing them as a joke. Nevertheless, subsequent reviews of the band's discography have been more positive.
