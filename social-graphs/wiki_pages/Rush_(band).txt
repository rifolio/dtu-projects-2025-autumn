'''Rush''' was a Canadian [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Toronto]] in 1968 that consisted primarily of [[Geddy Lee]] (vocals, bass, keyboards), [[Alex Lifeson]] (guitars) and [[Neil Peart]] (drums, percussion). The band's original line-up consisted of Lifeson, drummer [[John Rutsey]], and bassist and vocalist [[Jeff Jones (bassist)|Jeff Jones]], whom Lee immediately replaced. After Lee joined, the band went through a few line-up changes before arriving at its classic [[power trio]] line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their [[Rush (Rush album)|self-titled debut album]]; this line-up remained unchanged for the remainder of the band's career.

Rush first achieved moderate success with their second album, ''[[Fly by Night (album)|Fly by Night]]'' (1975). The commercial failure of their next album ''[[Caress of Steel]]'', released seven months after ''Fly by Night'', resulted in the band nearly getting dropped from their then-record label [[Mercury Records]]. Rush's fourth album, ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'' (1976), reignited their popularity, becoming their first album to enter the top five of the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Albums Chart. Their next two albums, ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'' (1978), were also successful, with the former becoming Rush's first to enter the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The band saw their furthest commercial success throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with most albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including ''[[Permanent Waves]]'' (1980), ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' (1981), ''[[Signals (Rush album)|Signals]]'' (1982), ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' (1984), ''[[Roll the Bones]]'' (1991), ''[[Counterparts (Rush album)|Counterparts]]'' (1993), and ''[[Test for Echo]]'' (1996). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band went on a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' (2002), ''[[Snakes & Arrows]]'' (2007), and ''[[Clockwork Angels]]'' (2012). Rush performed their final concerts in 2015, with Peart retiring from music later that year. Lifeson confirmed in January 2018 that the band decided not to resume activity following the [[R40 Live Tour|R40 Tour]], which was later cemented by Peart's death in January 2020. Lee and Lifeson have continued to periodically work together since Peart's death, including performing at the 25th anniversary celebration of ''[[South Park]]'' and tributes to then-recently deceased [[Foo Fighters]] drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] in 2022.

Rush are known for their virtuosic musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs, which drew primarily on [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]] and [[philosophy]]. The band's style changed over the years, from a [[blues]]-inspired [[hard rock]] beginning, later moving into [[progressive rock]], then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock in the 1990s and 2000s. ''Clockwork Angels'' marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls in various years.

As of 2024, Rush ranks 90th in the US with sales of 26 million albums<ref>{{cite web |title=RIAA – Top Selling Artists |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists |access-date=March 21, 2022 |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |archive-date=December 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209120422/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists |url-status=live}}</ref> and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 42 million.

The band was formed in the neighbourhood of [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale]] in Toronto, Ontario, by guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]], bassist and frontman [[Jeff Jones (bassist)|Jeff Jones]], and drummer [[John Rutsey]], in August 1968.<ref name="RV88"/> Lifeson and Rutsey had been friends since a young age and played together in a short-lived band, The Projection (formerly known as The Lost Cause).{{sfn|Daly|Hansen|2019|p=16-17}}<ref name=familytree>{{cite web |url=https://www.rushisaband.com/blog/2018/09/17/5149/50th-anniversary-of-Rushs-first-show |title=Rush is a Band Blog: 50th anniversary of Rush's first show |website= rushisaband.com |access-date=April 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= Banasiewicz |first= Bill |title= Rush Visions: The Official Biography (excerpt) |url= http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/BanasiewiczVisions.htm |access-date=March 10, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011130610/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/BanasiewiczVisions.htm |archive-date= October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Afterward the two stuck together and brought in Jones to form a new group; their first gig was in September at the Coff-Inn, a youth centre in the basement of St. Theodore of Canterbury Anglican Church in Willowdale; they were paid CA$25.<ref name=RV88/><ref name="PROG13">{{cite web |last=Elliot |first=Paul |date=April 2013 |title=PROG: Rush Limited Edition – Men at Work |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20130400prog.htm |access-date=December 27, 2018 |website=Prog |issue=35 |archive-date=December 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228035100/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20130400prog.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> They had not named themselves at the time of the booking; Rutsey's brother Bill thought they needed a name that was short and to the point.

Due to increasing difficulties in getting to Lifeson's house for practise, Jones suggested that Lifeson get his schoolmate Gary "Geddy" Weinrib to step in on lead vocals and bass.<ref name="JONES22">{{cite web |last=Daly |first=Andrew |date=November 7, 2022 |title=Rush before Geddy Lee: meet the bass player who stepped aside |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/rush-before-geddy-lee-meet-the-bass-player-who-stepped-aside |access-date=December 13, 2022 |publisher=Loudersound }}</ref> Weinrib replaced Jones as Rush's frontman, adopting the stage name [[Geddy Lee]]. Rush rehearsed a set mainly formed of covers by various rock artists, including [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and [[John Mayall]]. The band underwent several line-up configurations that included Lindy Young (who was recruited in early 1969) on keyboards and various instruments, and Mitch Bossi on second guitar (later on, in 1971).<ref name=RV88/> Shortly after becoming a four-piece band of Lee, Lifeson, Young and Rutsey, [[Ray Danniels]] was hired to be their manager. As Lee recounted years later, 
{{blockquote|Ray came along. He had no real reputation yet as a manager or anything. He was just kind of an agent working in Toronto. So he started directing the band and he just thought I wasn't suitable, for whatever reasons he had. I don't know whether it was the way I looked, or my religious background – who the f--- knew? Anyway, he influenced them and they went along with it, Alex Lifeson and John Rutsey, and I was out.<ref name=UCR_Lee_talks>[https://ultimateclassicrock.com/geddy-lee-talks-about-getting-fired-from-rush-in-the-early-days/ "Geddy Lee Talks About Getting Fired From Rush In The Early Days"]. ultimateclassicrock.com, June 2, 2012.</ref>}}

With Lee kicked out of the band in spring 1969, Rutsey recruited new bassist and vocalist Joe Perna, and the group of Lifeson, Rutsey, Young and Perna named themselves Hadrian. But after a disastrous gig with Perna, Rutsey invited Lee back in September 1969 and the group resumed as Rush.<ref name=PROG13/> Lee stated, "I started a blues band (named Ogilvie, then Judd, and joined by Lindy Young<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.cygnus-x1.net/2018/09/geddy-lee-joined-rush-fifty-years-ago.html |title=Geddy Lee Joined Rush Fifty Years Ago Today |date=September 25, 2018}}</ref>) and I was, frankly speaking, doing better than they were. Then I got a call from John and he said, 'Can we get together?' Basically, 'Can you come back? We're sorry.{{'"}}<ref name=UCR_Lee_talks /> Second guitarist Mitch Bossi joined during the first half of 1971<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.2112.net/powerwindows/tours/700000mitchbossi.htm|title=Rush With Mitch Bossi, Fall 1970 - Spring 1971|website=2112.net|access-date=August 29, 2025}}</ref> but after that, the band stabilized as a trio of Lifeson, Rutsey and Lee.{{sfn|Daly|Hansen|2019|p=35-36}} They kept Danniels as their manager, with his business partner and agent Vic Wilson sharing duties.<ref name=RV88/>

Rush honed their skills with regular gigs, initially touring the Ontario high school circuit. In 1971, the legal drinking age was decreased from 21 to 18, allowing the band to play bars and clubs. Lee said it was at this point that Rush turned "from a basement garage band that played the occasional high school gig to a regular working band playing six days a week."<ref name=PROG13/><ref name=SUP85/> A demo tape was then shipped to various record labels, but Rush were unable to secure a deal, leading to the formation of their own label, [[Moon Records (Canada)|Moon Records]], with Danniels.<ref>{{cite web |last=Somers |first=Marcie |date=July 4, 2007 |title=Geddy Lee of Rush – Making Music |url=http://www.popentertainment.com/rush.htm |access-date=July 15, 2019 |website=Pop Entertainment |archive-date=July 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715043928/http://www.popentertainment.com/rush.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> Rush entered the studio in 1973 to record their first single; their cover of "[[Not Fade Away (song)#Rush version|Not Fade Away]]" by [[Buddy Holly]] was chosen as it had become a crowd favourite. "You Can't Fight It", an original song, was put on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Released in September, it went to No. 88 on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart. That same month, Rush performed their first major gig, opening for the [[New York Dolls]] in Toronto, and finished putting down tracks for their first album. The initial sessions produced undesirable results over the sound quality, so tracks were recut and remixed with a new engineer, [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]].<ref name=MR74/> Danniels sold his management company to help raise funds to make the record.<ref name=BH82/> Rutsey wrote the lyrics, but tore them up on the day Lee was to record them and would not produce a new set. Lee quickly wrote a fresh set based on earlier versions, which was used on the final takes.{{sfn|Popoff|2004|pp=13–14}}

The debut album, ''[[Rush (Rush album)|Rush]]'', was released in March 1974; the initial pressing of 3,500 copies quickly sold out.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kerridge-Porter |first=Nathan |date=March 21, 2014 |title=Rush Reissue Their 1974 Self-Titled Moon Records |url=https://entertainment-focus.com/2014/03/21/rush-reissue-their-1974-self-titled-moon-records/ |access-date=January 4, 2021 |publisher=Entertainment Focus |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204163117/https://entertainment-focus.com/2014/03/21/rush-reissue-their-1974-self-titled-moon-records/ |url-status=live}}</ref> It went on to peak at No. 86 on the ''RPM'' Top Albums chart.

She added "[[Working Man]]" to the station's regular playlist, and the song's blue-collar theme resonated with hard rock fans in the predominantly working class city.<ref>{{cite web |last=Halper |first=Donna |title=The Rush Discovery Story |url=http://www.rushtrader.com/interviews/discovery.htm |access-date=February 6, 2017 |website=RushTrader |archive-date=June 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624191019/http://www.rushtrader.com/interviews/discovery.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> In June 1974, Danniels signed Rush to the American booking agency ATI, of which executive Ira Blacker sent a copy of ''Rush'' to [[Mercury Records]].

Following a series of Canadian dates, Rutsey played his last gig with the band on July 25. His preference for more straightforward rock was incompatible with the more complex music that Lifeson and Lee had written, and Lee recalled that Rutsey had a general distaste for life as a touring musician.<ref name="SUP85">{{cite web |last=Gett |first=Steve |year=1985 |title=Books – Success Under Pressure by Steve Gett |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19850100gettsuccess.htm |access-date=January 4, 2021 |archive-date=September 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190915145909/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19850100gettsuccess.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> His [[Type 1 diabetes]] caused further complications, as he required frequent hospital visits to have tests and receive insulin.<ref name=PROG13/><ref name="TCS11">{{cite web |date=April 6, 2011 |title=The Girl Who Loved Rush: Donna Halper |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20110406clevelandsound.htm |access-date=January 1, 2021 |website=The Cleveland Sound |archive-date=February 4, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210204004803/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20110406clevelandsound.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> Since October 1973, Rutsey's health had often been too critical for him to perform; in the months prior to his departure, Rush temporarily replaced him with a substitute drummer, Gerry Fielding.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Taylor|first=Peter|date=October 20, 1973|title=Nuts & Bolts|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RPM-IDX/IDX/70s/RPM-1973-10-20-OCR-Page-0007.pdf |access-date=April 22, 2024 |magazine=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]}}</ref><ref name=LS16/>

The band followed ''Fly by Night'' quickly with ''[[Caress of Steel]]'' (1975), a five-track album featuring two extended multi-chapter songs, "The Necromancer" and "The Fountain of Lamneth".

In light of these events, Rush's record label tried to pressure the members into moulding their next album in a more commercially friendly and accessible fashion; the band ignored the requests and developed their next album ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'' (1976) with a 20-minute title track divided into seven sections. Despite this, the album was the band's first taste of significant commercial success as it reached No. 5 in Canada,<ref name="worldradiohistory.com" /> becoming their first to reach double platinum certification.<ref name="CRIA" />

Rush toured in support of ''2112'' between February 1976 and June 1977 with concerts in Canada, the US, and for the first time Europe, with dates in the UK, Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=SUP85/>{{sfn|Popoff|2004|p=44}} The three sold-out shows at [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto in June 1976 were recorded for Rush's debut live album, ''[[All the World's a Stage (album)|All the World's a Stage]]''.

===1977–1981: peak progressive era===
After the conclusion of the ''2112'' tour, Rush went to Wales to record ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'' (1978) at [[Rockfield Studios]]. These albums saw the band members expanding the progressive elements in their music. "As our tastes got more obscure", Lee said in an interview, "we discovered more progressive rock-based bands like [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Van der Graaf Generator]] and [[King Crimson]], and we were very inspired by those bands. They made us want to make our music more interesting and more complex, and we tried to blend that with our own personalities to see what we could come up with that was indisputably us."<ref>Wanderman, David. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110615053316/http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/rush/geddylee.asp "Geddy Lee Interview"]. UGO.com,</ref> Increased synthesizer use, lengthy songs, and highly dynamic playing featuring complex [[time signature]] changes became a staple of Rush's compositions. To achieve a broader, more progressive sound, Lifeson began to experiment with [[Classical guitar|classical]] and [[twelve-string guitar]]s, and Lee added [[Moog Taurus|bass-pedal synthesizers]] and [[Minimoog]]. Likewise, Peart's percussion became diversified in the form of [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], [[glockenspiel]], wood blocks, [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbells]], [[timpani]], [[gong]], and [[tubular bell|chimes]]. Beyond instrument additions, the band kept in stride with progressive rock trends by continuing to compose long, conceptual songs with science fiction and fantasy overtones. As the new decade approached, Rush gradually began to dispose of their older styles of music in favour of shorter and sometimes softer arrangements, due in part to the band's exhaustion from recording ''Hemispheres''. The lyrics up to this point were heavily influenced by classical poetry, fantasy literature, science fiction, and the writings of novelist [[Ayn Rand]], as exhibited most prominently by their 1975 song "Anthem" from ''Fly By Night'' and a specifically acknowledged derivation in ''2112'' (1976).<ref>2112 and Ayn Rand [http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#62 Rush FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222184534/http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#62 |date=February 22, 2017}}.

Rush's popularity reached its pinnacle with the release of ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' in February 1981. ''Moving Pictures'' essentially continued where ''Permanent Waves'' left off, extending the trend of accessible and commercially friendly progressive rock that helped thrust them into the spotlight.

''Moving Pictures'' was Rush's last album to feature an extended song, the 11-minute "[[The Camera Eye]]".

===1981–1989: synthesizer-oriented era===

The band underwent another stylistic change with the recording of ''[[Signals (Rush album)|Signals]]'' in 1982.<ref name="Signals Review by Greg Prato">{{Cite web |last=Prato |first=Greg |title=Signals – Rush |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r17139 |access-date=2008-03-22 |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> While Lee's synthesizers had been featured instruments since the late 1970s, keyboards were shifted from the background to the melodic front-lines<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=October 28, 1982 |title=Signals Review |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/signals-19821028 |access-date=December 18, 2010 |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-date=August 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805041700/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/signals-19821028 |url-status=live}}</ref> in songs like "[[Countdown (rush song)|Countdown]]" and the opening track, "[[Subdivisions (song)|Subdivisions]]".

''Signals'' also represented a drastic stylistic transformation apart from instrumental changes. The album contained Rush's biggest hit single, "New World Man", while other more experimental songs such as "Digital Man", "The Weapon", and "Chemistry" expanded the band's use of [[ska]], reggae, and [[funk]].<ref name=BBH100/><ref>{{cite web |title=The Band: 40 Million Records. 40 + Years – About Rush (Moving Pictures) |url=https://www.rush.com/band |website=Rush.com |access-date=May 3, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Visions, the Official Rush Biography, Chapter 10 |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/BanasiewiczVisions.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185510/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/BanasiewiczVisions.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |access-date=May 6, 2006 |website=Power Windows |publisher=2112.net}}</ref> The second single, "Subdivisions" reached No. 36 in Canada and No. 5 on the US Album Rock Tracks Chart.

Although the band members consciously decided to move in this overall direction, creative differences between the band and longtime producer Terry Brown began to emerge. The band felt dissatisfied with Brown's studio treatment of ''Signals'', while Brown was becoming more uncomfortable with the increased use of synthesizers.<ref>Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage Documentary</ref> Ultimately, Rush and Brown parted ways in 1983, and the experimentation with new electronic instruments and varying musical styles would come into further play on their next studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rushvault.com/2011/12/27/terry-brown-differed-with-band-on-electronics/ |title=Terry Brown: Differed with Band on Electronics |website=Rushvault.com |date=December 27, 2011 |access-date=February 16, 2022}}</ref>

The style and production of ''Signals'' were augmented and taken to new heights on ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' (1984). It was Peart who named the album, as he borrowed the words of [[Ernest Hemingway]] ("Courage is grace under pressure"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/ernest_hemingway_131094|title=Ernest Hemingway - Courage is grace under pressure|website=Brainyquote.com}}</ref>) to describe what the band had to go through after making the decision to leave Brown. Producer [[Steve Lillywhite]], who gained fame with successful productions of [[Simple Minds]] and [[U2]], was enlisted to produce ''Grace Under Pressure''. He backed out at the last moment, however, much to the ire of Lee, Lifeson and Peart. Lee said, "Steve Lillywhite is really not a man of his word ... after agreeing to do our record, he got an offer from Simple Minds, changed his mind, blew us off ... so it put us in a horrible position." Rush eventually hired [[Peter Henderson (record producer)|Peter Henderson]] to co-produce and engineer the album instead. Henderson was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on [[Supertramp]]'s ''[[Breakfast in America]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Grace Under Pressure |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/GUPlyrics.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121230808/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/GUPlyrics.htm |archive-date=November 21, 2009 |access-date=February 16, 2008 |website=Power Windows |publisher=2112.net}}</ref>

With new producer [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], the band released ''[[Power Windows (album)|Power Windows]]'' (1985) and ''[[Hold Your Fire]]'' (1987). The music on these two albums gives far more emphasis and prominence to Lee's multi-layered synthesizer work, and he switched to an English-made [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] MK1 bass. While fans and critics took notice of Lifeson's diminished guitar work, his presence was still palpable. Lifeson, like many guitarists in the mid to late 1980s, experimented with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord bursts and thin leads. ''Power Windows'' went to No. 2 in Canada while peaking at No. 9 and 10 in the UK and US, respectively. The lead track, "[[The Big Money]]" made the Top 50 in Canada, the UK and US, plus No. 4 on the US Mainstream Rock Chart. ''Hold Your Fire'' represents both an extension of the guitar style found on ''Power Windows'', and, according to AllMusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia, the culmination of this era of Rush.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |title=Hold Your Fire – Rush |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r17147 |access-date=2007-09-20 |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> ''Hold Your Fire'' only went gold in the US, whereas the previous five Rush albums had gone platinum, although it managed to peak at No. 13 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hold your Fire |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/HYFlyrics.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121230824/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/HYFlyrics.htm |archive-date=November 21, 2009 |access-date=September 14, 2007 |website=Power Windows website |publisher=2112.net}}</ref> and made the Top 10 in Canada, the UK and Finland.

A third live album and video, ''[[A Show of Hands]]'' (1989), was also released by Anthem and Mercury following the ''Power Windows'' and ''Hold Your Fire'' tours, demonstrating the aspects of Rush in the '80s.

Rush started to deviate from its 1980s style with the albums ''[[Presto (album)|Presto]]'' (1989) and ''[[Roll the Bones]]'' (1991). Produced by record engineer and musician [[Rupert Hine]], these two albums saw Rush shedding much of its keyboard-saturated sound. Beginning with ''Presto'', the band opted for arrangements notably more guitar-centric than the previous two studio albums. Although synthesizers were still used, they were no longer featured as the centrepiece of Rush's compositions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gregory Heaney |title=Presto |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/presto-mw0000654443 |access-date=November 24, 2013 |website=AllMusic.com |archive-date=June 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610072302/http://www.allmusic.com/album/presto-mw0000654443 |url-status=live}}</ref> Continuing this trend, ''Roll the Bones'' extended the use of the standard three-instrument approach with even less focus on synthesizers than its predecessor. While musically these albums do not deviate significantly from a general pop-rock sound, Rush incorporated other musical styles such as [[funk]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] in "[[Roll the Bones (song)|Roll the Bones]]" and jazz in the instrumental track "[[Rush instrumentals#Where's My Thing?|Where's My Thing?]]".<ref>''Roll the Bones'' [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r17152|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic:].

On November 18, 2013, Lifeson said the band would take a year off, following the completion of the world tour in support of ''Clockwork Angels''. "We've committed to taking about a year off", Lifeson said. "We all agreed when we finished this [''Clockwork Angels''] tour [in early August], we were going to take this time off and we weren't going to talk about band stuff or make any plans. We committed to a year, so that's going to take us through to the end of next summer, for sure. That's the minimum. We haven't stopped or quit. Right now we're just relaxing.

==Reputation and legacy==
{{Further|List of awards and nominations received by Rush}}
More than 40 years of activity provided Rush with the opportunity for musical diversity across their discography. As with many bands known for experimentation, changes inevitably resulted in dissent among critics and fans. The bulk of the band's music included synthetic instruments, and this has been a source of contention among fans and critics, especially the band's heavy usage of synthesizers and keyboards during the 1980s, particularly on ''Grace Under Pressure'', ''Power Windows'', and ''Hold Your Fire''.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r17142|pure_url=yes}} "Grace Under Pressure"].

It has sold about 343,000 units to date.

Rush's triple-CD live album, ''Rush in Rio'' (2003), was certified gold, marking the fourth decade in which a Rush album had been released and certified at least gold. In 2004, ''Feedback'' cracked the top 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and received radio airplay. The band's 2007 album, ''[[Snakes & Arrows]]'', debuted at No. 3 (just one position shy of Rush's highest-peaking albums, ''Counterparts'' (1993) and ''Clockwork Angels'' (2012), which both debuted at No. 2) on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling about 93,000 in its first week of release.<ref>{{cite web |title=Snakes & Arrows chart rankings |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/News.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185503/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/News.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |access-date=August 7, 2007 |website=Power Windows |publisher=2112.net}}</ref> This marks the 13th Rush studio album to appear in the Top 20 and the band's 27th album to appear on the chart.

==Live performances==
The members of Rush shared a strong work ethic, desiring to accurately recreate songs from their albums when playing live performances. To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush included a capacious rack of [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound "events" in real time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members shared duties throughout most songs. Each member had one or more [[MIDI controller]]s, which were loaded with different sounds for each song, and they used available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s).<ref>{{cite web |date=September 2002 |title=Rush Rolls Again |url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm |archive-date=October 18, 2002 |access-date=December 18, 2010 |publisher=OnStage Magazine}}</ref> It was with this technology that the group was able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans had come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.<ref>{{cite web |date=March 1990 |title=Backstage Club Newsletter |url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm |access-date=December 31, 2011 |website=Power Windows |publisher=2112.net |archive-date=March 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302025240/http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> The members' coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to "play" sampled instruments and audio events was subtly visible in their live performances, especially on the R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour, their 2005 concert DVD.{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}

A staple of Rush's concerts was Neil Peart's drum solos, which included a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour saw his solos become more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart used [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to elicit sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], glockenspiel, [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], tubular bells, and [[vibraslap]], as well as other, more esoteric percussion.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

One prominent feature of Rush's concerts were props on stage, at one point called "diversions". These props have included washing machines, vintage popcorn poppers, animations, and inflatable rabbits emerging from giant hats behind the band.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Joyce |first=Mike |date=May 9, 1990 |title=Colorful Diversions From Rush |newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref> Starting in the mid-'90s, the props often took up Lee's side of the stage ([[Blocking (stage)|stage left]]) as a way to balance out the amp stacks on Lifeson's side (stage right) when Lee opted to use a venue's house system instead of amps.

==Philanthropy==
Rush actively participated in philanthropic causes. The band were one of several hometown favourites to play [[Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto]], also dubbed SARStock, at [[Downsview Park]] in Toronto on July 30, 2003, with an attendance of over half a million people. The concert benefited the Toronto economy after the [[SARS]] outbreaks earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 31, 2003 |title=Stones, AC/DC Rock Toronto Benefit |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69754/stones-acdc-rock-toronto-benefit |access-date=November 24, 2019 |website=Billboard.com |archive-date=August 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819224610/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69754/stones-acdc-rock-toronto-benefit |url-status=live}}</ref> The band has also sustained an interest in promoting human rights. They donated $100,000 to the [[Canadian Museum for Human Rights]] after a concert they held in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on May 24, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |date=May 29, 2008 |title=Rush Contribute to Canadian Museum for Human Rights |url=http://www.winnipegfirst.ca/article/2008/05/29/rush_contribute_to_canadian_museum_for_human_rights |access-date=July 25, 2008 |publisher=Winnipeg First |archive-date=September 22, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922025237/http://www.winnipegfirst.ca/article/2008/05/29/rush_contribute_to_canadian_museum_for_human_rights |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Rockers Rush donate cash to human rights museum |publisher=CBC News |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/rockers-rush-donate-cash-to-human-rights-museum-1.743170?ref=rss |date=May 28, 2008 |access-date=July 25, 2008 |archive-date=September 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200930063208/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/rockers-rush-donate-cash-to-human-rights-museum-1.743170?ref=rss |url-status=live}}</ref>

On July 24, 2013, Rush performed a benefit concert in Red Deer, Alberta, at the [[ENMAX Centrium]], with all proceeds going to the [[Canadian Red Cross]] to help victims of the 2013 flooding that devastated many regions of southern Alberta. The original venue for the show, the [[Scotiabank Saddledome]], was heavily damaged from the flooding and was unavailable for the concert date as originally planned.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 11, 2013 |title=To Perform Alberta Flood Relief Benefit Concert |url=http://www.rush.com/rush-to-perform-alberta-flood-relief-benefit-concert/ |access-date=August 7, 2013 |publisher=RUSH |archive-date=July 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715021852/http://www.rush.com/rush-to-perform-alberta-flood-relief-benefit-concert/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Rush have also been big supporters of [[Little Kids Rock]], a nonprofit that works to restore and revitalize music education programs in disadvantaged US public schools. They teamed up with [[Musician's Friend]] and [[Sabian Cymbals|Sabian]] to help Little Kids Rock provide percussion to public schools nationwide. They donated $500 of the proceeds from every Neil Peart Paragon Cymbal Pack sold, each of which came with a free splash cymbal personalized, autographed, and dated by Peart.
