==History==
===1962–1967: Formative years===
Status Quo were formed in 1962 under the name The Paladins<ref>{{cite sign |title=Celebrating Seven Decades of Quo |year=2023 |type=Exhibition caption |location=[[Barbican Library]], London |quote=The Scorpions have always been cited as the band's first name and this is ingrained into Quo history. However, this has now been exposed as an urban myth. [...] We called ourselves 'The Paladins' for a short while – before changing to The 'Spectres'. – [[Alan Lancaster]]}}</ref> by [[Francis Rossi]] (vocals, guitar) and [[Alan Lancaster]] (bass) at [[Sedgehill School|Sedgehill Comprehensive School]], [[Catford]], London, along with classmates Jess Jaworski (keyboards) and Alan Key (drums).<ref name="Status Quo: Just Doin' It!"/> In 1963, Key was replaced by [[John Coghlan (drummer)|John Coghlan]] and the band changed their name to The Spectres.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> After changing their name, Lancaster's father arranged for the group to perform weekly at a venue called the Samuel Jones Sports Club in [[Dulwich]], London, where they were noticed by Pat Barlow, a [[gasfitter]] and budding [[Talent manager|pop music manager]]. Barlow became the group's manager and secured them spots at venues around London, such as El Partido in [[Lewisham]] and Café des Artistes in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].<ref name="I Talk Too Much: My Autobiography">{{cite book |last1=Rossi |first1=Francis |title=I Talk Too Much: My Autobiography|publisher=Constable |isbn=978-1472130204 |page=Loc. 544–553 of 4402 (in the Amazon Kindle version) |ref=I Talk Too Much: My Autobiography |date=14 March 2019}}</ref> In 1965, when Rossi, Lancaster and Jaworski left school, Jaworski opted to leave the band and was replaced by Roy Lynes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quoticker.de/SQTICKERUKYEARREVIEW65.htm |title=QUOTICKER – Year review 1965 |website=Quoticker.de |access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref>

During 1965, the band played a summer season residency at [[Butlins]] Holiday Camp in Minehead, during which they met [[Rick Parfitt]], who was playing guitar with a cabaret band called The Highlights. By the end of the residency, Rossi and Parfitt – who had become close friends – made a commitment to stay friends and work together at some point in the future. On 18 July 1966, the Spectres signed a five-year deal with [[Piccadilly Records]], releasing two singles that year, "[[I (Who Have Nothing)]]" (first recorded by [[Joe Sentieri]] and most famously covered by [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]) and "[[Hurdy Gurdy Man (The Spectres song)|Hurdy Gurdy Man]]" (an original song by Alan Lancaster), and one the next year called "[[(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet]]" (originally recorded by New York psychedelic band the [[Blues Magoos]]).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> All three singles failed to make an impact on the [[record chart|charts]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{cite book |first=David |last=Roberts |year=1998 |title=Guinness Rockopedia |edition=1st |publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd. |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/417 417] |isbn=0-85112-072-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/417 }}</ref>

In 1967, the group's sound began moving towards [[psychedelia]] and they renamed themselves Traffic, but were soon forced to change it to Traffic Jam to avoid confusion with [[Steve Winwood]]'s new band [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], following an argument over who had registered the name first.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> The band secured an appearance on BBC Radio's ''[[Saturday Club (BBC Radio)|Saturday Club]]'', but in June their next single, "[[Almost But Not Quite There]]" (an original song by Francis Rossi), underperformed. The following month saw Parfitt, at the request of manager Pat Barlow, joining the band as rhythm guitarist and vocalist. Shortly after Parfitt's recruitment, in August 1967, the band officially became The Status Quo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quoticker.de/SQTICKERUKYEARREVIEW67.htm |title=QUOTICKER – year review 1967 |website=Quoticker.de |access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref>

===1968–1971: Breakthrough and development of classic style===
[[File:Status Quo, 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|The Status Quo in 1968, from a promotional poster for the single "Black Veils of Melancholy" – clockwise from top: [[Francis Rossi]], [[John Coghlan (drummer)|John Coghlan]], [[Rick Parfitt]], Roy Lynes, [[Alan Lancaster]]]]
In January 1968, the group released the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-flavoured "[[Pictures of Matchstick Men]]".<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> The song hit the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching number seven; "Matchstick Men" became the group's only Top 40 hit in the United States, peaking at number twelve on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Although Status Quo's albums have been released in the United States throughout their career, they never achieved the same level of success there as they have in Britain.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Though the follow-up was the unsuccessful single "Black Veils of Melancholy", they had a hit again the same year with a pop song penned by [[Marty Wilde]] and [[Ronnie Scott (songwriter)|Ronnie Scott]], "[[Ice in the Sun]]", which climbed to number eight.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> All three singles were included on the band's first album ''[[Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from the Status Quo]]'', released in September 1968. After the breakthrough, the band management hired [[Bob Young (artist)|Bob Young]] as a [[roadie]] and [[tour manager]]. Over the years Young became one of the most important songwriting partners for Status Quo, in addition to occasionally playing harmonica with them on stage and on record.

After their second album, 1969's ''[[Spare Parts (album)|Spare Parts]]'', failed commercially, the band's musical direction moved away from psychedelia towards a more [[hard rock]]/[[boogie]] rock sound. The change in sound also brought a change in image, away from [[Carnaby Street]] fashions to faded denims and T-shirts, an image which was to become their trademark throughout the 1970s.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> The new direction was displayed on the band's third album, 1970's ''[[Ma Kelly's Greasy Spoon]]'' and its preceding single "[[Down the Dustpipe]]". Lynes left the band in 1970 with the remaining members continuing as a four-piece, although they were often joined in the [[recording studio|studio]] by guest keyboard players including Jimmy Horowitz, Tom Parker and [[Andy Bown]], the latter an ex-member of [[The Herd (UK band)|The Herd]] and [[Judas Jump]] and part of the Peter Frampton Band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quoticker.de/SQTICKERUKYEARREVIEW70.htm|title=QUOTICKER – year review 1970 |website=Quoticker.de|access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref> In 1976, Bown also began playing live with the band and was eventually made an official member of Status Quo in 1981. The band's first recording without Lynes was the late 1970 single "[[In My Chair]]", followed by their fourth album ''[[Dog of Two Head]]'' in 1971.

===1972–1981: Signing to Vertigo and major success===

In 1972 the band left Pye Records and signed with the heavy rock and progressive label [[Vertigo Records]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Their first album for Vertigo, ''[[Piledriver (album)|Piledriver]]'', was released in 1972, going Top 5 in the UK. ''Piledriver'' heralded an even heavier, self-produced sound.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> This album was essentially the stylistic template for their next four albums, ''[[Hello! (album)|Hello!]]'' (1973), ''[[Quo (Status Quo album)|Quo]]'' (1974), ''[[On the Level]]'' (1975) and ''[[Blue for You]]'' (1976).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> ''Hello!'' was the band's first UK No. 1 album, while ''Quo'' reached No. 2 and ''On the Level'' and ''Blue for You'' both also reached No. 1.  In 1976, they signed a pioneering sponsorship deal with [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> The following year the group released a double ''[[Live! (Status Quo album)|Live!]]'' album, which reached No. 3 in the UK.

Quo's hit singles from this era, with peak UK chart position and year, include:  "[[Paper Plane (song)|Paper Plane]]" (No. 8 in 1972), "[[Caroline (Status Quo song)|Caroline]]" (No. 5 in 1973), "[[Break the Rules (Status Quo song)|Break The Rules]]" (No. 8 in 1974), "[[Down Down]]" (No. 1 in 1975), "[[Roll Over Lay Down]]" (No. 10 in 1975), "[[Rain (Status Quo song)|Rain]]" (No. 7 in 1976), "[[Mystery Song]]" (No. 11 in 1976), "[[Wild Side of Life]]" (No. 9 in 1976), "[[Rockin' All Over the World]]" (No. 3 in 1977), "[[Again and Again (Status Quo song)|Again and Again]]" (No. 13 in 1978), "[[Whatever You Want (Status Quo song)|Whatever You Want]]" (No. 4 in 1979), "[[Living on an Island]]" (No. 16 in 1979), "[[What You're Proposing]]" (No. 2 in 1980), the [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]] "[[Lies (Status Quo song)|Lies]]" and "[[Lies (Status Quo song)|Don't Drive My Car]]" (No. 11 in 1980), "[[Somethin' 'Bout You Baby I Like]]" (No. 9 in 1981) and "[[Rock 'n' Roll (Status Quo song)|Rock 'n' Roll]]" (No. 8 in 1981).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/status-quo-mn0000745241/biography|title=Status Quo &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=21 July 2021}}</ref> "Down Down" topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January 1975, becoming their only [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1970s|UK No. 1]] single to date.<ref name="500 Number One Hits">{{cite book |first=Jo |last=Rice |year=1982 |title=The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits |edition=1st |publisher=Guinness Superlatives Ltd |location=Enfield, Middlesex |page=164 |isbn=0-85112-250-7}}</ref>

From 1977 onwards, the band's sound became more polished as they began to employ outside producers. [[Roger Glover]] of [[Deep Purple]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] was the first outside producer to work with Quo since [[Pye Records|Pye]]'s [[John Schroeder (musician)|John Schroeder]] in the early 1970s, and produced the non-album single "Wild Side of Life" and its [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] "All Through The Night" in 1976. The next three studio albums, ''[[Rockin' All Over the World (album)|Rockin' All Over the World]]'' (1977), ''[[If You Can't Stand the Heat...]]'' (1978) and ''[[Whatever You Want (album)|Whatever You Want]]'' (1979), were produced by [[Pip Williams]], while the band's first two albums of the 1980s, ''[[Just Supposin']]'' (1980) and ''[[Never Too Late (Status Quo album)|Never Too Late]]'' (1981), were produced by John Eden. All five of these albums went Top 5 in the UK. The [[Rockin' All Over the World (song)|title track]] of ''Rockin' All Over the World'', a minor hit for its writer [[John Fogerty]] (formerly of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]), became one of Status Quo's most enduring anthems.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> In 1980 the band released a No. 3 charting greatest hits album ''[[12 Gold Bars]]''.

===1981–1990: Lineup changes, Live Aid and ''In The Army Now''===
Tensions within the band saw Coghlan leaving late in 1981.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> His replacement was [[Pete Kircher]] from the 1960s pop band [[Honeybus]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Andy Bown also became an official member of the band at this time. This line-up recorded three albums, ''[[1+9+8+2]]'', ''[[Live at the N.E.C.]]'' (both 1982) and ''[[Back to Back (Status Quo album)|Back to Back]]'' (1983). Although contracted to record more albums, this line-up played its last full-length gig on 21 July 1984 at the [[Milton Keynes Bowl]]. "Everybody was [[Cocaine dependence|coked-up]] and hating each other", Rossi recalled, "and I'd started drinking [[tequila]] on that tour. I don't remember that show at all – the encores or anything; just falling flat on my back at one point."<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Dave |last=Ling |title=Again again again… |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |issue=36 |date=January 2002|page=69}}</ref> "Deciding to retire from the road – all that was about was getting Francis a solo career," declared Lancaster. "Nobody on the outside knew it, but he didn't want to work with me or Rick anymore."<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Dave |last=Ling |title=Again again again… |magazine=Classic Rock |issue=36 |date=January 2002 |page=73}}</ref> In 1984, the band released a cover of "[[The Wanderer (Dion song)|The Wanderer]]" by [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]] as a single from ''[[12 Gold Bars Vol. 2]]'', which reached No. 7 while the album reached No. 12.<ref name=":0" />

Status Quo's final appearance with the Kircher line-up opened the [[Live Aid]] charity event at Wembley Stadium in July 1985.<ref name=":2" /> That year, Rossi recorded and released two solo singles with long-time writing partner Bernie Frost. Parfitt recorded a solo album, ''Recorded Delivery'', with bass player [[John Edwards (musician)|John "Rhino" Edwards]] and drummer [[Jeff Rich]]. The album remains unreleased, although some tracks were reworked and released sporadically as Quo B-sides until 1987.

In mid-1985, Rossi, Parfitt and Bown, with Edwards and Rich, started work on a new Quo album. Lancaster – by this time more or less settled in Australia – took out a [[Injunction|legal injunction]] to stop the band using the Status Quo name,<ref>{{cite news |last=McIver |first=Joel |date=27 September 2021 |title=Alan Lancaster obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/sep/27/alan-lancaster-obituary |access-date=7 April 2024 |work=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> citing increasing musical differences, notably during sessions for ''Back to Back''. The specific dispute concerned two tracks that became hits for the group around that time. Lancaster had co-written "[[Ol' Rag Blues]]", but was angered when the producers chose to release a version with Rossi singing the lead vocal instead of one sung by himself. The injunction also prevented the release of a single, "Naughty Girl", for which a catalogue number was issued by Vertigo.

An out-of-court settlement was made in January 1986, giving Rossi and Parfitt the rights to the band's name,<ref>{{cite news |date=9 December 2005 |title=The enduring appeal of Status Quo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4513178.stm |access-date=7 April 2024 |work=[[BBC]] }}</ref> enabling the new Status Quo line-up to continue recording ''[[In the Army Now (album)|In The Army Now]]'',<ref>{{cite web |last=Ling |first=Dave |date=26 September 2022 |title=The life, music and troubled times of Status Quo's Alan Lancaster |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-life-music-and-troubled-times-of-status-quos-alan-lancaster |access-date=7 April 2024 |website=loudersound }}</ref> for which "Naughty Girl" was reworked as "Dreamin'". Lancaster remained in Australia, and in 1986 joined an Australian [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], [[The Party Boys]], featuring [[Angry Anderson]] of [[Rose Tattoo]], [[John Brewster (musician)|John Brewster]] of [[The Angels (Australian band)|the Angels]] and [[Kevin Borich]], but achieved little success outside Australia. Lancaster left Status Quo formally in 1987.

In 1986, Quo supported [[Queen (band)|Queen]] on the latter's [[Magic Tour (Queen)|Magic Tour]]. The commercially successful ''In the Army Now'' album was released later that year, peaking at No.&nbsp;7 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |date= |title=STATUS QUO |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/17941/status-quo/ |access-date=28 March 2024 |website=Official Charts }}</ref> Its title track became one of the band's biggest UK singles, reaching No.&nbsp;2.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> The following album, ''[[Ain't Complaining]]'', in 1988, was less successful but produced the No.&nbsp;5 hit "[[Burning Bridges (Status Quo song)|Burning Bridges]]".<ref name=":0" /> Rerecorded (with new lyrics) in April 1994 with [[Manchester United F.C.]] as "[[Come On You Reds]]", the single would have given the band their second UK No.&nbsp;1, but it was credited as 'by Manchester United'. The following album, 1989's ''[[Perfect Remedy]]'', became their first since 1971's ''Dog of Two Head'' not to go Top 20 in the UK. In 1990 the band scored their last UK Top 10 single with "[[The Anniversary Waltz (Status Quo song)|The Anniversary Waltz Part One]]", a medley of rock and roll classics to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Rossi and Parfitt's first meeting. The track was recorded for a new greatest hits album ''[[Rocking All Over the Years]]'', which reached No.&nbsp;2 in the UK, while a follow-up medley "[[The Anniversary Waltz (Status Quo song)|The Anniversary Waltz Part Two]]" appeared as a single at the end of the year.<ref name=":0" />

===1991–2009: ''Rock 'Til You Drop'', ''Don't Stop'' and touring===
The early-to-mid-1990s saw falling album sales for the band. To promote the release of the ''[[Rock 'til You Drop]]'' album (1991), Quo performed four arena gigs in Sheffield, Glasgow, Birmingham and London in the space of 12 hours, earning them a place in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2IBSoKMsgQC |title=Every Chart Topper Tells a Story: The Seventies |last=Davis |first=Sharon |year=2012 |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |isbn=9781780574103 |page=125}}</ref> 1992 brought the band's third live album, ''[[Live Alive Quo]]''. The next studio album, 1994's ''[[Thirsty Work]]'', included a cover of the [[Jennifer Warnes]] song "[[I'm Restless]]" revealing an alternative and lighter sound to the band.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> ''[[Don't Stop (Status Quo album)|Don't Stop]]'' (1996) and ''[[Famous in the Last Century]]'' (2000) consisted almost entirely of [[cover version]]s, with the only exception being the title track to the latter.  The former reached No. 2 in the UK Album Charts, the band's highest-charting studio album of the 1990s, and produced three UK Top 40 singles with covers of  [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]]' "[[When You Walk in the Room]]",  [[The Beach Boys]]' "[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]" and [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s "[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]".

In December 2005, it was announced that Parfitt had been taken ill and was undergoing tests for [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]]. All subsequent dates of the UK tour were cancelled as a result.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=9 December 2005 |title=Quo star in throat cancer scare |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/quo-star-throat-cancer-scare-1599779 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821224208/https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/quo-star-throat-cancer-scare-1599779 |archive-date=21 August 2016 |access-date=4 September 2025 |website=Chronicle Live}}</ref> However, the growths in Parfitt's throat were found to be [[benign]] and were successfully removed.
