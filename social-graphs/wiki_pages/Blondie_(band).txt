'''Blondie''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in New York City in 1974 by singer [[Debbie Harry]] and guitarist [[Chris Stein]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chater |first=David |title=The X Factor; Iraq: The Legacy; Outnumbered; Blondie; Peter Serafinowicz |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5318731.ece |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |location=London |date=December 13, 2008 |access-date=April 26, 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The band was a pioneer in the American [[New wave music|new wave]] genre and scene of the mid-1970s.

The band's first two albums also contained strong elements of [[Punk rock|punk]]. Although successful in the UK and Australia, Blondie was regarded as an [[underground music|underground band]] in the US until the release of their critically acclaimed third album in 1978, ''[[Parallel Lines]]''. Over the next two years, the band released a string of hit singles,<ref>[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/blondie "Blondie"].

Blondie disbanded after the release of their sixth studio album, ''[[The Hunter (Blondie album)|The Hunter]]'', in 1982.

===1974–1978: Early career===
Inspired by the burgeoning new music scene at the [[Mercer Arts Center]] in [[Manhattan]], musician Chris Stein sought to join a similar band. He joined the Stilettoes in 1973 as their guitarist and formed a romantic relationship with Debbie Harry, who was one of the band's vocalists, a former waitress and [[Playboy Bunny]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Camuto |first=Robert |title=Does Blondie Really Have More Fun? |url=http://www.rip-her-to-shreds.com/archive_press_magazines_boulevardsfeb81.php |url-status=dead |magazine=Boulevards |date=February 1981 |access-date=July 30, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027050842/http://www.rip-her-to-shreds.com/archive_press_magazines_boulevardsfeb81.php |archive-date=October 27, 2006 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Harry had been a member of a folk-rock band, [[The Wind in the Willows (band)|The Wind in the Willows]], in the late 1960s.<ref name=":1" /> In July 1974, Stein and Harry parted ways with the Stilettoes and Elda Gentile, the band's originator, forming a new band with ex-Stilettoes bandmates Billy O'Connor (drums; born 1953, died 2015)<ref name=post-gazette>{{cite news

The band's first commercial success occurred in Australia in 1977, when the music television program ''[[Countdown (music show)|Countdown]]'' mistakenly played their video "[[In the Flesh (Blondie song)|In the Flesh]]", which was the B-side of the single "X-Offender".<ref name=blondie/> Jimmy Destri later credited the show's [[Molly Meldrum]] for their initial success, commenting that "we still thank him to this day" for playing the wrong song.<ref>{{cite web |last=Matera |first= Joe  | title = Blondie, for the Big Takeover No.&nbsp;53 | url=http://archive.blondie.net/jimmy_destri_interview_200308_b.shtml |publisher=Blondie official website |date=August 2003 |access-date=July 25, 2006}}</ref> In a 1998 interview, drummer Burke recalled seeing the episode in which the wrong song was played, but he and Stein suggested that it may have been a deliberate subterfuge on the part of Meldrum. Stein asserted that "X-Offender" was "too crazy and aggressive [to become a hit]", while "In the Flesh" was "not representative of any punk sensibility. Over the years, I've thought they probably played both things but liked one better. That's all." In retrospect, Burke described "In the Flesh" as "a forerunner to the [[power ballad]]".<ref name="paulcashmere">{{cite web |first= Paul |last= Cashmere | title = The Blondie Interview| work = Undercover Media | year= 1998 |access-date = July 24, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231163913/http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/blondie.html|archive-date=December 31, 2006| url =http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/blondie.html  }}</ref>

In November 1980, Blondie's fifth studio album and third with Chapman, ''[[Autoamerican]]'' (UK number three,<ref name=occ/> US number seven, Australia number eight<ref name=kent/>), was released. ''Autoamerican'' contained two more US number one hits: the reggae-styled "[[The Tide Is High]]", a cover version of a 1967 song written by [[John Holt (singer)|John Holt]] of [[the Paragons]],<ref name=":1" /> and the [[rap music|rap]]-flavored<ref name="PARELES1999"/> "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]", which was the first song featuring rapping to reach number one in the US.<ref name="Taylor"/> In the song, Harry mentions the [[hip hop]] and graffiti artist [[Fab Five Freddy]] who also appears in the video for the song.

The album went platinum in both the US and the UK.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

Blondie took a break for most of 1981. Debbie Harry appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in February 1981 as both the guest host-actor and as a singer, with Stein and Burke backing her during musical performances. Harry and Destri both released solo albums.

Infante was initially not included in the new album due to friction with other group members, but began legal proceedings and was later reinstated after an out-of-court settlement.<ref name=":1" /> In contrast to their earlier commercial and critical successes, ''The Hunter'' was poorly received. The album had two moderate hit singles: "[[Island of Lost Souls (song)|Island of Lost Souls]]" (UK number&nbsp;11,<ref name="occ" /> US number&nbsp;37, Australia number 13<ref name="kent" />) and "[[War Child (song)|War Child]]" (UK number&nbsp;39<ref name="occ">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/16742/blondie/|title=Official Charts > Blondie|date=February 18, 1978 |publisher=[[Official Charts Company|The Official UK Charts Company]]|access-date=May 26, 2016}}</ref>).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-hunter-r2081/review |title=The Hunter – Blondie &#124; AllMusic |publisher=Allmusic.com |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref> The album also included "For Your Eyes Only", a track the band had been commissioned to write and record for the [[For Your Eyes Only (film)|1981 James Bond film of the same name]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=The best Bond themes that never made it |url=https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200218-the-best-james-bond-themes-that-never-made-it-to-the-screen |access-date=2023-11-25 |website=www.bbc.com|date=February 18, 2020 }}</ref> which was rejected by the film's producers who ultimately chose another [[For Your Eyes Only (song)|song with the same title]] recorded by [[Sheena Easton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/03/blondies-debbie-harry-it-wasnt-a-great-idea-to-be-as-reckless-as-i-was|work=The Guardian|title=Blondie's Debbie Harry: 'It wasn't a great idea to be as reckless as I was'|first1=Dave|last1=Simpson|date=March 3, 2022}}</ref>

In June 1982, Harry contributed backing vocals to [[the Gun Club]]'s second album, ''[[Miami (The Gun Club album)|Miami]]'', being credited as "D.H. Lawrence Jr".

Harry embarked on solo career in the mid-1980s, including two singles—the 1983 track "Rush Rush" from the film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', and the 1985 track "Feel The Spin"—released while she continued to feature in films. Harry released the album ''[[Rockbird]]'' in 1986, with active participation from Stein. The album was a moderate success in the UK where it reached gold certification and gave her a UK top 10 hit with "[[French Kissin' (song)|French Kissin']]". Meanwhile, Burke became a much-in-demand session drummer, playing and touring with [[Eurythmics]] for their 1986 album ''[[Revenge (Eurythmics album)|Revenge]]'', and Destri maintained an active career as a producer and session musician.<ref name=":1" />

A [[remix]] album entitled ''[[Once More into the Bleach]]'' was released in 1988, and featured remixes of classic Blondie tracks and material from Harry's solo career, including "Denis".<ref name=":1" /> Harry continued releasing solo albums, [[Def, Dumb & Blonde|''Def, Dumb and Blonde'']] (1989) and ''[[Debravation]]'' (1993), while continuing to tour.

===1997–2007: Re-formation, ''No Exit'' and ''The Curse of Blondie''===
[[File:Blondie (Roskilde Festival 1999) (3668215038).jpg|thumb|Blondie at [[Roskilde Festival]] 1999]]
During the 1990s, Blondie's past work began to be recognized again by a new generation of fans and artists including [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] and [[No Doubt]].<ref name=undercover/><ref name = prnewswire>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/01-31-2006/0004271713&EDATE= "Blondie Announces Release of Greatest Hits – Sound & Vision, Featuring Brand New Mash-Up With The Doors"].

Harry continued her moderately successful solo career after the band broke up, releasing albums in 1989 and 1993 which helped keep the band in the public eye. In 1990, she reunited with Stein and Burke for a summer tour of mid-sized venues as part of an "Escape from New York" package with [[Jerry Harrison]], the [[Tom Tom Club]] and the [[Ramones]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Tom Tom Club, Ramones Rev Up 'Escape' Road Show|date= July 18, 1990 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1990/07/18/tom-tom-club-ramones-rev-up-escape-road-show/  |access-date=April 21, 2017}}</ref>

In 1996, Stein and Harry began the process of reuniting Blondie and contacted original members Burke, Destri, and Valentine. Valentine had by this time moved to London and become a full-time writer under his real name, [[Gary Lachman]]—his ''New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation'' (2002) is a memoir of his years with the band.<ref>{{Cite book

In 1997, the original five-piece band re-formed—including Valentine on bass—and made three live appearances, all at outdoor festivals sponsored by local radio stations.

A new album, ''[[No Exit (Blondie album)|No Exit]]'' (UK number&nbsp;three,<ref name=occ/> US number&nbsp;eighteen), was released in February 1999. The band was now officially a four-piece, consisting of core original members Harry, Stein, Burke and Destri. By this point, Valentine had left the group and did not play on the album or contribute to the writing of any songs—two songs on the album co-authored by "Valentine" were in fact co-authored by [[Kathy Valentine]] of [[the Go-Go's]], no relation to Gary Valentine. Session musicians Leigh Foxx (bass) and Paul Carbonara (guitar) played on this and subsequent Blondie releases.<ref>Foxx had been in Harry's backing band as early as her January 17, 1987, musical guest appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', later touring with her on the 1990 "Escape from New York" tour before both became members of the re-formed band's formal lineup in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>

''No Exit'' reached number three on the UK charts<ref name=occ/> and the first single "[[Maria (Blondie song)|Maria]]", which Destri had written thinking about his high school days,<ref>{{cite web | url =http://archive.blondie.net/archives/archived20030811/transcript_twec_onlinechat_1999dec06.html | title = Blondie online chat | publisher = Blondie.net | date= December 6, 1999 | access-date = July 23, 2006 }}</ref> became Blondie's sixth UK number one single<ref name=occ/> 20 years after their first chart-topper "Heart of Glass". This gave the band the distinction of being one of only two American acts to reach number one in the UK singles charts in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (the other being [[Michael Jackson]] who had number&nbsp;one hits with [[the Jacksons]] and solo in the same decades).{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

The re-formed band released the follow-up album ''[[The Curse of Blondie]]'' (UK number&nbsp;36,<ref name=occ/> US number&nbsp;160) in October 2003. ''Curse'' proved to be Blondie's lowest-charting album since their debut in 1976, although the single "[[Good Boys (song)|Good Boys]]" managed to reach number 12 in the UK charts.<ref name=occ/>

In 2004, Jimmy Destri left the group in order to deal with drug addiction, leaving Harry, Stein and Burke as the only members of the original line-up still with the band. Though Destri's stint in rehab was successful, he was not invited back into the band.<ref>[http://archive.blondie.net/blondie_jimmy_destri.shtml "Jimmy Destri"]. Blondie.net.

Blondie undertook a North American tour of mid-sized venues with [[Pat Benatar]] and [[the Donnas]] in the summer of 2009.

On December 21, 2019, Blondie announced through their social media that they would release an EP and mini-documentary entitled ''Vivir en La Habana''. It was recorded during the band's residency in [[Havana]], Cuba, in March 2019, and directed by Rob Roth and was shown at several film festivals around the globe. The EP is not entirely a "live" recording as Stein, who was not present at the Havana concerts, added guitar parts in the studio to enhance the live tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Blondie/photos/a.10150257301163389/10157719718913389/?type=3&theater |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/76174813388/10157719718913389 |archive-date=2022-02-26 |url-access=limited|title=Coming soon... the ''Vivir en La Habana'' EP and mini documentary series.|last=Blondie|date=December 21, 2019|website=Facebook|access-date=December 27, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In October 2020, Harry and Stein appeared in [[The Gregory Brothers|Schmoyoho's]] parody of the [[2020 United States presidential debates|2020 US presidential debates]] between vice presidential candidates [[Kamala Harris]] and [[Mike Pence]] in a song titled "One Heartbeat Away", where they played the role of moderators.
