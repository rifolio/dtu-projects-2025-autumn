==Early years==
Ondrasik was born in Los Angeles, California, a child of a musical family. He is of [[Slovaks|Slovak]] descent. His mother was a piano teacher who taught at [[John F. Kennedy High School (Los Angeles)|John F. Kennedy High School]] in [[Granada Hills, Los Angeles]], where he graduated.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mailtribune.com/happening-now/2018/01/19/the-transformation-of-piano-man-john-ondrasik/ | title=The transformation of piano man John Ondrasik | access-date=December 1, 2022 | archive-date=December 1, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221201195153/https://www.mailtribune.com/happening-now/2018/01/19/the-transformation-of-piano-man-john-ondrasik/ | url-status=dead }}</ref> He learned the piano as a child.  In his teens, he learned to play the guitar and started to write music. While he also learned to sing opera, taught by [[Ron Anderson (voice coach)|Ron Anderson]], he soon decided that he wanted to be a singer and songwriter.<ref name="Savio">{{Cite web |last=Savio |first=Jason |title=Five for Fighting brings band together for tour, plus other Cape Cod concerts to check out |url=https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/entertainment/2022/07/26/cape-cod-music-five-fighting-kevin-bacon-brothers-ani-difranco/10070408002/ |access-date=2023-05-13 |website=Cape Cod Times |language=en-US}}</ref>

While in college, Ondrasik continued to pursue music in his spare time. He graduated from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] with a degree in [[applied science]] and [[Applied mathematics|mathematics]].<ref name="Mlive">{{cite web |title=Five fun facts about the man behind Five for Fighting |url=https://www.mlive.com/onthetown/2015/07/five_fun_facts_about_the_man_b.html |website=MLive.com |date=July 27, 2015 |access-date=December 2, 2021}}</ref>

==Career==
=== Early musical career (1988–1995) ===
After graduating from UCLA in 1988, Ondrasik became associated with the [[glam metal]] scene. He befriended [[Whitesnake]] bassist [[Rudy Sarzo]]<ref>{{cite web|via=[[YouTube]]|title=#68: JOHN ONDRASIK, Five for Fighting, Multi-Platinum Artist: On Persistance|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2UD4zsregI|language=en|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref> and later formed a band with [[Scott St. Clair Sheets]], best known for his work with [[Pat Benatar]], called John Scott. Ondrasik later described the band's genre as "pop metal", comparing their sound to [[Bon Jovi]]. John Scott signed a management deal in the early 1990s, but any hopes of mainstream success were shattered with the rise of [[grunge]]. "We had some good songs and had some interest and were about to do a big management deal and then this little band called [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] came out and the whole hair-metal thing blew up," said Ondrasik.<ref name="Savio"/> Despite this, several John Scott recordings have survived.<ref>{{Cite web |title=John Scott (1990-91) |url=http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhdafredByfkanZOPzAIcaoN5CaZ5MC0H |access-date=2024-07-04 |website=YouTube |language=en}}</ref>

Three John Scott songs co-written by Sheets and Ondrasik appeared on a 1997 [[arena rock]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/St-Clair-St-Clair/release/6266471|title=St. Clair – St. Clair|website=Discogs.com|year=1997 |language=en|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref> album from Sheets' band, St. Clair, which also featured Sarzo. Ondrasik did not perform on the album, but received writing credits for the re-recorded John Scott songs "After the Fire", "Shadow of Myself", and "Turn the Wheel" (a re-written version of "On the Streets Again" by John Scott).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://labibledelawestcoast.blogspot.com/2019/12/st-clair-st-clair-1997-aor.html|title=La Bible de la Westcoast Music – Cool Night -: St. Clair "St. Clair" (1997) -AOR|date=September 12, 2019|website=Labibledelawestcoast.blogspot.com|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETWZqhlPc-U&list=PLhdafredByfkanZOPzAIcaoN5CaZ5MC0H&index=3 |title=John Scott - On the Streets Again (1990) |date=2024-05-24 |last=Ondrasik Archive |access-date=2024-07-04 |via=YouTube}}</ref> Sheets and Ondrasik would collaborate again much later, in 2008, when Ondrasik provided vocals for Sheets' song "Fly Me Away".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gcnews.com/articles/former-resident-in-songwriter-finals/|title=Former Resident In Songwriter Finals|date=April 18, 2008|website=Garden City News|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref>

After John Scott parted ways, Ondrasik says he then "went back to the piano, where I belonged."<ref>{{cite web|title=#68: JOHN ONDRASIK, Five for Fighting, Multi-Platinum Artist: On Persistance|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2UD4zsregI|publisher=[[YouTube]]|language=en|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref>

Ondrasik spent the early 1990s playing singer-songwriter gigs around Los Angeles. He signed with an [[EMI]] music publisher, Carla Berkowitz,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mike |first=Boehm |date=1988-06-07 |title=Songwriters Pay to Play Their Works, Then Pray : Seminar on Creating, Selling Pop Songs No Place for Fragile Egos |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-06-07-ca-3778-story.html |access-date=2023-08-27 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> who discovered him in a bar on Melrose and Vine.

===Becoming "Five for Fighting" and first album (1995–1999)===
In 1995, Ondrasik signed with EMI Records. He adopted Five for Fighting as a "band name" that same year<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/five-for-fighting-mn0000796281/credits|title=Five for Fighting {{!}} Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Interview and 100 Years Live on SportsCenter|date=March 31, 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltbv7kqZqjU |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/ltbv7kqZqjU |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|language=en|access-date=November 11, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> at the request of EMI executives, who found Ondrasik's name difficult to pronounce.<ref name="Heuston">{{cite web|url=https://mailtribune.com/news/happening-now/the-transformation-of-piano-man-john-ondrasik|title=The transformation of piano man John Ondrasik|last=Heuston|first=Laurie|date=January 19, 2018|website=Mail Tribune|access-date=November 11, 2019|archive-date=November 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111013427/https://mailtribune.com/news/happening-now/the-transformation-of-piano-man-john-ondrasik|url-status=dead}}</ref> EMI also had concerns that the male singer-songwriter was "dead" in the mid-1990s. According to Ondrasik, the label "loved" the name Five for Fighting even though it sounded like a "heavy-metal band".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Q&A: Five for Fighting's John Ondrasik |url=https://www.nhl.com/kings/news/q-a-five-for-fightings-john-ondrasik/c-597240 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230827192529/https://www.nhl.com/kings/news/q-a-five-for-fightings-john-ondrasik/c-597240 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2023-08-27 |access-date=2024-11-16 |website=NHL.com |language=en-US}}</ref> "Five for fighting" is an [[ice hockey]] expression that means a five-minute major [[Penalty (ice hockey)|penalty]] for [[Fighting in ice hockey|participating in a fight]]. 

Five for Fighting's first album, ''[[Message for Albert]]'', was released by EMI in March 1997. However, EMI Records' American division closed that June.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/21/business/emi-shutting-2-new-york-based-record-labels.html|title=Emi Shutting 2 New York-Based Record Labels|date=June 21, 1997|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 11, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Although the album itself had already been released, there were no singles from ''Message''. "Bella's Birthday Cake" was intended as the lead single, judging by the existence of radio promos and demos featuring the song. The song "Ocean" appears alongside "Bella's Birthday Cake" on some promotional cassettes, suggesting it was viewed as a potential second single.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Five-For-Fighting-Bellas-Birthday-Cake-Ocean/release/1012569|title=Five For Fighting – Bella's Birthday Cake / Ocean|website=Discogs|year=1997 |language=en|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref>

[[AllMusic]] called ''Message for Albert'' "intelligent and well-crafted", concluding that it was "a promising debut that sadly lost its shot when EMI spontaneously combusted after the record's release."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/message-for-albert-mw0000095038|title=Message for Albert – Five for Fighting {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref>

After the demise of EMI's American branch, Ondrasik tried to have ''Message for Albert'' re-released through [[Capitol Records]] or [[Virgin Records]], but was unsuccessful.<ref name="songwriteruniverse.com"/> Five for Fighting left EMI in the aftermath and recorded demos of "[[Easy Tonight]]" and "Jainy",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Aware-Seven-The-Compilation/release/8605726|title=Various – Aware Seven: The Compilation|website=Discogs|year=1999 |language=en|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> both of which were re-recorded for 2000's ''[[America Town]]'' album. [[Capitol Records]] eventually did re-release ''Message'' after the success of ''America Town''.

=== Breakthrough and peak commercial success (2000–2006) ===
Aware Records' Mark Cunningham made initial contact with Ondrasik.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_SSmith.html |title=Interview with Steve Smith |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=October 29, 2003 |access-date=October 7, 2011}}</ref> Cunningham then passed Ondrasik's demos to the label's new A&R Steve Smith.<ref name="hitquarters" /> After a discussion with Aware head [[Gregg Latterman]], Smith met with Ondrasik and set up a deal in partnership with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="hitquarters" />

His second album, ''[[America Town]]'', was released on September 26, 2000. In addition to 10 all-new songs, ''America Town'' included two re-recorded songs from the ill-fated ''Message for Albert'' album ("The Last Great American" and "Love Song"). "Easy Tonight" became the album's lead single in 2000. It received moderate airplay and peaked at number 26 on the Adult Top 40.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/five-for-fighting/chart-history/ | title=Five for Fighting | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}</ref>

The second single, "[[Superman (It's Not Easy)]]", was a commercial success, reaching number 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and number 1 on the Adult Top 40. The song became an anthem after the [[September 11 attacks]] and Ondrasik performed the song at [[The Concert for New York City]] on October 20, 2001. "Superman" was nominated for a [[44th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy in 2002]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/five-fighting/15808 |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 23, 2022 |archive-date=May 26, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220526201819/https://www.grammy.com/artists/five-fighting/15808 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After the success of "Superman", two more songs were released as singles – the title track "America Town" and "Something About You" in 2002 and 2003, respectively – but neither song charted. While ''America Town'' did not reach the top 50 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, the album was certified Platinum in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gold & Platinum: Five for Fighting America Town |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Five+for+Fighting&ti=America+Town&format=Album&type=#search_section |website=riaa.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |author=Billboard Staff |date=2004-12-23 |title=Usher Leads Year-End RIAA Certs |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/usher-leads-year-end-riaa-certs-1422876/ |access-date=2023-11-14 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref>

His third album, ''[[The Battle for Everything]]'', debuted at number 20 on ''Billboard'' 200 chart in February 2004. Some versions of the album were paired with a bonus CD, a five-song EP called ''2 + 2 Makes 5''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Five-For-Fighting-The-Battle-For-Everything/release/479949|title=Five For Fighting – The Battle For Everything|website=Discogs|date=October 26, 2004 |language=en|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> ''Battle'' included the single "[[100 Years (song)|100 Years]]", which reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart and stayed at number one for 12 non-consecutive weeks.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2002-08-31/adult-contemporary Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart info] ''Billboard''. Retrieved August 29, 2010.</ref> "Devil in the Wishing Well" was the album's second single, reaching number 23 on the Adult Top 40. A third single, a cover of "Silent Night" from the ''2 + 2 Makes 5'' EP, reached number 2 on the US Adult Contemporary charts.

''The Battle for Everything'' was certified Platinum by the RIAA, making it Five for Fighting's second straight Platinum-selling album. It received mixed reviews from critics, with [[AllMusic]] praising the record's "nice craftsmanship" and noting that it was "one of the more interesting, detailed" records in its genre. However, AllMusic was critical of the "pompous narcissism" of the lyrics, calling Ondrasik "deadly serious".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-battle-for-everything-mw0000326540|title=The Battle for Everything – Five for Fighting {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> Todd Goldstein of [[PopMatters]] also criticized the album's "pomposity", but enjoyed "Angels and Girlfriends" for its "unexpected chord changes" and "uncharacteristically quirky" lyrics. He singled out "The Taste" for its surprising energy, writing that during "the only pure guitar-rocking song among the twelve midtempo ballads, John Ondrasik ''screams''. It's a raucous, Howlin' [[Pelle Almqvist]] moment of sheer unselfconscious exuberance."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/fiveforfighting-battle-2495904096.html|title=Five for Fighting: The Battle for Everything|date=June 23, 2004|website=PopMatters|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> Another writer said Ondrasik seemed like a "contradictory figure" for his blend of romanticism and irreverence on ''The Battle for Everything'': "There's '100 Years,' the first single, a meditation on the poetry of time passing. But then there's 'The Taste,' whose delicate opening gets pulverized by slashing electric guitar and a raw, screaming vocal." According to Ondrasik, when recording ''Battle'', he and producer [[Bill Bottrell]] "were ambitious to the point of absurdity. If we wanted drama, we'd get a thirty-piece orchestra. If we wanted a rock edge, we went after it with reckless abandonment."<ref>{{cite web|title=John Ondrasik {{!}} Yamaha Artists|url=https://www.yamaha.com/artists/johnondrasik.html|access-date=September 28, 2020|website=Yamaha.com}}</ref>

=== Continued mainstream success (2006–2009) ===
Two years later, the album ''[[Two Lights (album)|Two Lights]]'' was released; this became his first career top 10 album, debuting at number eight on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart in August 2006. Its first single, "[[The Riddle (Five for Fighting song)|The Riddle]]", became Ondrasik's third career top 40 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 40. It reached number three on the AC charts and number seven on the Hot AC charts. The second single, "[[World (Five for Fighting song)|World]]", reached number 14 on Hot AC charts, and the music video has been used to raise funds for various charities and as a theme for NASA's International Space Station (see [[#Philanthropy|Philanthropy]] below).

Five for Fighting released three live albums in 2007: ''Rhapsody Originals'' in January, ''iTunes Exclusive'' in June, and ''[[Back Country]]'' in October.

His fifth studio album, titled ''[[Slice (album)|Slice]]'', was released on October 13, 2009, and appeared on the iTunes top 10 albums on the first day. The album was produced by Gregg Wattenberg ("Superman", "100 Years"). Academy Award-winning composer [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], who penned the songs for musicals such as [[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]], [[Godspell]] and [[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]], co-wrote the title track, as well as the track "Above the Timberline". On July 21, 2009, the first single from Slice, called "[[Chances (Five for Fighting song)|Chances]]", was released for digital download. "Chances" was featured during the end credits of the hit film [[The Blind Side (film)|''The Blind Side'']]. "Chances" reached number 11 on the Hot AC radio chart.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

=== Career downturn and new record label (2010–2013) ===
By the early 2010s, Five for Fighting's "commercial success was in the rearview" and Ondrasik was not able to "reclaim his pop star status" from the 2000s.<ref name=":0"/> Five for Fighting and [[Columbia Records]] parted ways in 2010 after ten years. In a later [[Tedx Talk]] about songwriting, Ondrasik revealed that he was "dropped" from Columbia after one of his singles, "[[Slice (song)|Slice]]", turned out not to be a hit.<ref>{{Citation |title=Where songs come from: John Ondrasik at TEDxMidwest | date=June 26, 2012 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OukUOjhArQM |access-date=2024-02-10 |language=en}}</ref> He even wondered whether he was "done" with the music industry.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Moraski |first=Lauren |date=2013-09-16 |title=Five For Fighting on the "miracle" of new album, "Bookmarks" - CBS News |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/five-for-fighting-on-the-miracle-of-new-album-bookmarks/ |access-date=2024-02-10 |website=www.cbsnews.com |language=en-US}}</ref> However, [[Wind-up Records]] signed Five for Fighting and re-released the ''Slice'' album.<ref name="Five For Fighting | Official Site">{{cite web |url=http://www.fiveforfighting.com |title=Five For Fighting Official Site |access-date=May 17, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803102051/https://fiveforfighting.com/ |archive-date=August 3, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Shortly after Five for Fighting left Columbia, two compilation albums were released. One was a [[Greatest hits album|best of album]] called ''The Very Best of Five for Fighting.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Five-For-Fighting-Playlist-The-Very-Best-Of-Five-For-Fighting/release/9879878|title=Five For Fighting – Playlist: The Very Best Of Five For Fighting|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> It was released in 2011 and featured 14 songs in chronological order of their recording, beginning with "Bella's Birthday Cake" from 1997 and ending with 2010's "Slice". The other compilation album, also from 2011, was a bundle of Five for Fighting's two Platinum-selling albums, ''America Town'' and ''The Battle for Everything''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Five for Fighting - America Town/The Battle for Everything Album Reviews, Songs & More {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/america-town-the-battle-for-everything-mw0002185443 |access-date=2024-02-10 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Changing the field of play (2014–2020) ===
As Ondrasik entered his fifties, he decided to "change the field of play"<ref name=":1" /> rather than continuing to pursue chart position and record sales: "I just can't be doing it the same way I've always done it."<ref name=":0" /> Much of his activity in these years focused on television. Ondrasik and [[Stephen Schwartz]] sold a TV show called ''Harmony'' to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=2017-11-02 |title=The Next 'Cop Rock'?

=== Recent activity (2021–present) ===

In the 2020s, Ondrasik released a trio of songs about current geopolitical events. The first of these was "Blood on My Hands", a 2021 song critical of the [[Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)|withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan]]. The song prompted media discussion over censorship in music following YouTube's banning and subsequent restoration of the song's graphic music video on its platform.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lanum |first=Nikolas |date=January 10, 2022|title=John Ondrasik warns of 'political' censorship after YouTube temporarily removed Afghan withdrawal music video |url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/john-ondrasik-political-censorship-youtube-afghanistan-music-video |access-date=February 10, 2024 |website=[[Fox News]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

In March 2022, Ondrasik released "Can One Man Save the World?"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ondrasik |first1=John |title=Can One Man Change the World? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG91y8Jwt7c |website=You Tube |date=March 14, 2022 |access-date=March 18, 2022}}</ref> about the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], which he then performed on July 9, 2022, in [[Kyiv]] with the Ukrainian Orchestra. Ondrasik said:<blockquote>
I was honored to perform my new Ukraine tribute song Can One Man Save the World? with the Ukrainian Orchestra in the ruins of the Antonov Airport—in front of the Ukrainians' beloved Mriya, the world’s largest cargo plane that Russia destroyed at the outset of the war. In sharing this musical collaboration on such hallowed ground, I saw firsthand the fortitude and grace of the Ukrainian people, who whether playing a violin or driving a tank, will not be deterred by [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]]'s atrocities and aggressions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Uitti |first1=Jacob |title=John Ondrasik of Five for Fighting Performs "Can One Man Save the World?" with Ukrainian Orchestra in Kyiv |url=https://americansongwriter.com/john-ondrasik-of-five-for-fighting-performs-can-one-man-save-the-world-with-ukrainian-orchestra-in-kyiv/ |website=[[American Songwriter]] |date=July 10, 2022 |access-date=July 17, 2022}}</ref> 
</blockquote>

On January 18, 2024, Ondrasik released "OK" in response to the [[2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel|October 7, 2023 attack on Israel]] by [[Hamas]] and the subsequent global rise in [[antisemitism]]. He referred to the song as "a call to action to stand for good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, and call evil by name without 'context' or equivocation".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Spiro |first1=Amy |title=Five for Fighting pens October 7 ballad: 'We are not OK' |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/five-for-fighting-pens-october-7-ballad-we-are-not-ok/amp/ |website=[[The Times of Israel]] |date=January 23, 2024 |access-date=January 24, 2024}}</ref>

=== Musical style and influences ===
Ondrasik has been variously compared to other piano singer-songwriters like [[Elton John]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Dave Matthews]], and [[Ben Folds]], albeit "while still maintaining a harder rock edge exclusive to Five For Fighting."<ref name="themaneater.com">{{cite web|title=Maneater {{!}} Five for Fighting finds inspiration in Americana|url=https://www.themaneater.com/stories/arts/five-fighting-finds-inspiration-americana|access-date=September 28, 2020|website=Themaneater.com}}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> His more [[heartland rock]]-oriented tracks have been compared to those of [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Tom Petty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musicplayers.com/2006/09/john-ondrasik-riddles-justice-five-fighting/|title=John Ondrasik: Riddles, Justice, and Five for Fighting|date=September 1, 2006|website=MusicPlayers.com|language=en-US|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref> Ondrasik lists [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (and [[Freddie Mercury]] in particular<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fiveforfighting.com/bio/|title=Bio – Five For Fighting|language=en-US|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref>), [[Steve Perry]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Elton John]], [[Billy Joel]], and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] among his musical influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Musician-Band/fiveforfighting/about/|title=Five For Fighting|website=Facebook.com|language=en|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref>

Ondrasik makes heavy use of falsetto vocals in his music, with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' describing this as "a pleasant two-tone voice -- a tenor for setting up a situation and a higher register for driving a point home".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gallo|first1=Phil|date=March 1, 2004|title=Five for Fighting|url=https://variety.com/2004/music/markets-festivals/five-for-fighting-1200534762/|access-date=September 28, 2020|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref> ''[[PopMatters]]'' wrote that Ondrasik sings in a "[[Eddie Vedder|Vedder]]-lite croon," with an "instantly recognizable falsetto," also referring to it as "that kickass falsetto",<ref>{{Cite web |date=2004-06-23 |title=Five for Fighting: The Battle for Everything, PopMatters |url=https://www.popmatters.com/fiveforfighting-battle-2495904096.html |access-date=2023-05-13 |website=PopMatters |language=en-US}}</ref> while ''[[AllMusic]]'' compared his voice to "Eddie Vedder singing a lullaby."<ref>{{Citation |title=Five for Fighting - America Town Album Reviews, Songs & More {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/america-town-mw0000616265 |access-date=2023-05-14 |language=en}}</ref> Ondrasik's earliest surviving recordings, as the singer in John Scott, feature louder and raspier vocals, with ''[[Consequence (publication)|Consequence]]'' writing that he was "pretty convincing as a metal frontman."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-02-25 |title=10 Pop Rock and Alternative Rock Bands That Used to Be Heavy |url=https://consequence.net/list/pop-alternative-rock-bands-that-started-heavy/five-for-fighting/ |access-date=2025-03-07 |language=en-US}}</ref>

In addition to piano, Ondrasik plays the harmonica and acoustic guitar. He also plays electric guitar on studio recordings of some songs.<ref>"America Town CD Jacket," Aware and Columbia Records, 2000.

[[Grunge]] influences can also be heard in earlier albums, such as in "Wise Man" on ''Message for Albert'', "Michael Jordan" on ''America Town'', and a non-album song called "Big Cities". Accordingly, Ondrasik has acknowledged [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] as one of his influences.<ref name="encyclopedia.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/five-fighting|title=Five for Fighting {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

On his style at the turn of the millennium, when "Superman" became his first mainstream hit, Ondrasik said, "I kind of fancy myself as a rocker and a rock guy and here was this ballad." Even though the song was softer than his style at the time, Ondrasik is "so grateful that I had that chance to be heard with that song. It will always be my firstborn."<ref>{{cite web|date=September 1, 2020|title=John Ondrasik Goes Behind the Song On Five for Fighting Smash, "Superman"|url=https://americansongwriter.com/superman-by-five-for-fighting-behind-the-song-interview/|access-date=September 2, 2020|website=American Songwriter|language=en-US}}</ref> Five for Fighting's style became softer in the 2000s, with ''AllMusic'' calling this era of Five for Fighting an "adult alternative [[Mother ship|mother-ship]]" and "full-blown soft rock".<ref>{{Citation |title=Two Lights - Five for Fighting {{!}} Album {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/two-lights-mw0000778288 |access-date=2025-03-07 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Slice - Five for Fighting {{!}} Album {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/slice-mw0000827836 |access-date=2025-03-07 |language=en}}</ref>

Five for Fighting's live performances take a variety of forms: sometimes Ondrasik appears alone, switching between acoustic guitar and piano. Five for Fighting sometimes appears with touring musicians on bass, electric guitar, and drums. Five for Fighting also began playing orchestral shows in the early 2010s, often accompanied by a string quartet; Ondrasik has also appeared with the backing of full symphony orchestras for these shows. He often covers songs like "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]", "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]", "[[Message in a Bottle (The Police song)|Message in a Bottle]]",<ref>{{cite web|title=081719 Five For Fighting in Concert at Lake Mission Viejo Pt 2| date=August 23, 2019 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utPHwPumq_g |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/utPHwPumq_g |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|publisher=YouTube|language=en|access-date=November 11, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> and "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.idsnews.com/article/2018/09/entfivefighting092318|title=Five for Fighting finishes tour at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater|website=Indiana Daily Student|access-date=November 11, 2019}}</ref> at the end of live performances.

Ondrasik, under the auspices of the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO), performed for service members on a USO/Armed Forces Entertainment tour of [[Guantánamo Bay]] and other bases in Cuba in February and March 2007. He followed up with another USO tour in November 2007 of Japan, Guam and Hawaii. "I am struck by the sacrifices the troops and their families make for our way of life and I felt it was important to show my support", says Ondrasik.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

In November 2007, Ondrasik coordinated the release of 13 free songs for US military members called ''CD for the Troops''. There have been five CDs for the troops, and over one million copies have been given away. The songs donated included tracks from [[Billy Joel]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] and [[Sarah McLachlan]]. Subsequent volumes became available in 2008 (including songs by [[Gretchen Wilson]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Trace Adkins]]), 2009 (an album of comedy tracks with material from comedians such as [[Chris Rock]], [[Ray Romano]] and [[Adam Sandler]]), 2010 (featuring songs by [[Matchbox 20]], [[Brandi Carlile]], [[Ingrid Michaelson]], and [[Gavin DeGraw]]), and 2011 (artists including [[Sara Bareilles]], [[Mayday Parade]] and [[REO Speedwagon]]).

In February 2022 Ondrasik joined [[Tom Morello]], [[Victoria Williams]], [[Beth Hart]], and others on the song "God Help Us Now" about Afghan girls suffering in Afghanistan.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Selin |first=Alicia|date=2022-02-18 |title=Tom Morello, Serj Tankian + More Join Afghan Girls Group on Moving New Song 'God Help Us All' |url=https://loudwire.com/tom-morello-serj-tankian-afghan-girls-god-help-us-all/ |access-date=2023-11-14 |website=Loudwire |language=en}}</ref>

In May 2024, UCLA students established an encampment to protest against Israel.

During his statement,<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q757T-dVkTk |title=UCLA - Press Conference 5/3/24 Question for Chancellor Gene Block and message for Students |date=2024-05-07 |last= |access-date=2024-06-12 |via=YouTube}}</ref> he asked a series of hypothetical questions to UCLA faculty and administration about if they would protect Muslims if a "barbaric terrorist group" attacked them on campus. He sympathized with Jewish students nationwide, stressing that those who have not been "seduced by this mania" have been "abandoned by the administrators and presidents at this school [UCLA]". During this hypothetical questioning, he implied numerous activities that discriminate against Jewish students were being enacted at the UCLA Pro-Palestine encampment, including asking students their faith in order to access the school building. 
In June 2025, Ondrasik dedicated his 2001 hit, "[[Superman]]", which had previously been adopted as an anthem for the survivors the [[September 11 attacks]], to the [[Israeli hostages]] held in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] by [[Hamas]].<ref>https://www.wsj.com/opinion/my-2001-hit-song-superman-is-for-the-hostages-in-gaza-b3f6f739</ref>

==Personal life==
Ondrasik's year of birth has been subject to some confusion, with Encyclopedia.com listing his birth year as 1968 instead of 1965.<ref name="encyclopedia.com"/> A 2001 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article refers to him being 33 at the time rather than 36.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-02-ca-10577-story.html|title=A Fluke of Timing|date=December 2, 2001|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> A March 2002 interview from the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] gives his age as 33 at the time rather than 37.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20020308fighting4.asp|title=Music Review: 'Superman' is super for Five For Fighting|website=old.post-gazette.com|access-date=April 20, 2020|archive-date=April 21, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220421144208/http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20020308fighting4.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, Ondrasik himself referred to recently turning 55 during 2020, clearly implying that 1965 is his correct year of birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thebucket.com/podcast/five-for-fighting-dude-look-around/|title=Five for Fighting: "Dude, look around!"|date=February 13, 2020|website=The Bucket|language=en|access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>
