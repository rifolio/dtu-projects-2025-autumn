== Career ==

=== 1970s ===
[[File:The Runaways at Brumrock '76.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Jett (left) and [[Cherie Currie]] of The Runaways performing at Brumrock '76, [[Bingley Hall]], Birmingham, UK, September 25, 1976]]
At age 16, Jett became a founding member of [[the Runaways]] with drummer [[Sandy West]]. After the brief tenure of [[Michael Steele (musician)|Micki Steele]], who sang and played bass, [[Jackie Fox]], [[Lita Ford]], and [[Cherie Currie]] soon joined to complete the band which created the classic lineup. While Currie initially fronted the band, Jett shared some lead vocals, played rhythm guitar, and wrote or co-wrote some of the band's material along with Ford, West, and Currie. This lineup recorded three albums.
 
The band toured around the world and became an opening act for [[Cheap Trick]], [[Ramones]], [[Van Halen]], and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]. They found success abroad, especially in Japan. While the Runaways were popular in Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada, and South America, they could not garner the same level of success in the United States.<ref name="VH1"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Encore: Joan Jett Leaves Her Mark |work=Spin |date=March 2009 |url=http://spin-cdnsrc.texterity.com/spin/200903/?pg=90&pm=1 |access-date=March 11, 2010 |archive-date=October 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018175504/http://spin-cdnsrc.texterity.com/spin/200903/?pg=90&pm=1 |url-status=dead}}</ref> After Currie left the band, the band released two more albums with Jett handling the lead vocals: ''[[Waitin' for the Night]]'' and ''[[And Now... The Runaways]]''. While touring England with the Runaways in 1976, Jett first heard the song "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]" when she saw Arrows perform it on their weekly UK television series ''[[Arrows (TV series)|Arrows]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Paterson |first1=Colin |date=October 14, 2014 |title=Ten hits you may not know were cover versions |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29568083 |access-date=April 2, 2015 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Altogether, they produced five albums from 1975 until they disbanded in the spring of 1979.<ref>{{AllMusic|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|class=artist|id=p4612|tab=biography|label=Joan Jett biography}}</ref>

In 1979, she returned to Los Angeles, where she began fulfilling an obligation of the Runaways to complete a film that was loosely based on the band's career entitled ''We're All Crazee Now!'' Three actresses stood in for the departed band members, including [[Rainbeaux Smith]], who was also a rock drummer.<ref name="MTV">{{cite web |title=Kenny Laguna |url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/kenny-laguna/biography/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131125220823/http://www.mtv.com/artists/kenny-laguna/biography/ |archive-date=November 25, 2013 |access-date=April 18, 2014 |publisher=MTV}}</ref> The plug was pulled on the project halfway through shooting after Jett fell ill, but in 1984, after she became famous, producers looked for a way to use the footage from the incomplete film.<ref name="MTV"/> Parts of the original footage of Jett were eventually used in another project, an underground film called ''Du-beat-eo'', which was produced by Alan Sacks, but not commercially released.<ref name="MTV"/>

In 1979, Jett was in England pursuing a solo career. She recorded three songs there with the [[Sex Pistols]]' [[Paul Cook]] and [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], one of which was an early version of [[Arrows (British band)|Arrows]]' "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]". This version appears on the 1993 compilation album ''[[Flashback (Joan Jett album)|Flashback]]''.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 1, 1970 |title=Joan Jett 'I Love Rock and Roll' Classic Tracks |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb10/articles/classictracks_0210.htm |access-date=November 8, 2013 |work=Sound on Sound}}</ref> While working on ''We're All Crazee Now!'', Jett met songwriter and producer [[Kenny Laguna]], who was hired by her manager Toby Mamis to help Jett with writing some [[Soundtrack|tracks for the film]].<ref name="MTV"/> They became friends and decided to work together and Jett relocated to [[Long Beach, New York]], where Laguna was based.

=== 1980s ===
Jett and Laguna entered [[the Who]]'s [[Ramport Studios]] with the latter at the helm, and Jett's self-titled solo debut was released by [[Ariola Records]] in Europe on May 17, 1980. In the US, after the album was rejected by 23 major labels,<ref>{{cite web |title=Joan Jett and the Blackhearts |url=http://www.joanjett.com |access-date=August 25, 2010 |website=JoanJett.com}}</ref> Jett and Laguna released it independently on their new [[Blackheart Records]] label, which they started with Laguna's daughter's college savings. Laguna remembers, "We couldn't think of anything else to do but print up records ourselves."<ref name="MTV"/> With Laguna's assistance, Jett formed [[Joan Jett and the Blackhearts|the Blackhearts]]. It has undergone many lineup changes since its inception, with Jett and Laguna being its only consistent members.

It's beautiful, and I still have it, but it's heavy as shit. I jump and run around a lot onstage, and it was really getting to my shoulder, so I was looking for a lighter guitar. I heard from one of our [[road crew]] that [[Eric Carmen]] from the [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]] was selling a Melody Maker, so I ended up buying it. Now, this is the guitar that he played on "Go All the Way" and all those [Raspberries] hits. And then I played it on "I Love Rock 'n' Roll", "Crimson and Clover", "Do You Want to Touch Me", "Bad Reputation" ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It's so beautiful. It's white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It's an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don't even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it. I'm actually kind of afraid to bring out the original. It's got a great heritage.

=== Sexuality ===
For years Jett refused to either confirm or deny rumors that she is lesbian or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]]. In a 1994 interview with ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine she said, "I'm not saying no, I'm not saying yes, I'm saying believe what you want.

In 2016, former Runaways guitarist [[Lita Ford]] revealed in her memoir that she temporarily quit the band because the other members were "all gay," saying "First I found out that [[Sandy West|Sandy]], the one I had bonded with the most, was a lesbian. Then I found out that [[Cherie Currie|Cherie]] was messing around with Joan. I was so freaked out that I quit the band. When I found out that the girls were all gay in the band, I wasn't sure how to take it. I didn't know what it was."<ref>{{cite web |last=Brekee |first=Kira |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lita-ford-left-the-runaways-after-learning-about-gay-bandmates_n_56ce07d9e4b041136f193847 |title=Lita Ford Reveals She Quit The Runaways Because Her Bandmates 'Were All Gay' |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=February 29, 2016 |access-date=May 23, 2021}}</ref>

In a 2018 interview with ''the New York Times'', when asked about how an LGBT film festival did not want to show her documentary because she was not "out", Jett said: "They don't want the movie there because I don't declare? [Holding up her necklace] What the [expletive] is that? Two [[labrys]]es, or axes, crossing each other, inside of two women's symbols crossing each other. It's not been off since I got it.

=== Kim Fowley rape allegation ===
In July 2015, attorney [[Jackie Fox|Jackie Fuchs]] (formerly Jackie Fox of [[the Runaways]]) alleged that [[Kim Fowley]] raped her on New Year's Eve 1975, at a party following a Runaways performance at an Orange County club. Sixteen years old at the time, Fuchs was reportedly given [[Quaalude]]s by a man she thought was a roadie, and while she was incapacitated, Fowley allegedly raped her in full view of a group of partygoers and her bandmates Currie, West, and Jett; Ford was not present.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Cherkis |first=Jason |title=Jackie Fox of the Runaways Opens Up About Her Traumatic Rape |url=https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/the-lost-girls/ |access-date=October 6, 2020 |work=Huffington Post}}</ref> ''[[Look Away (2021 film)|Look Away]]'', a documentary about sexual abuse in the rock music industry features Fuchs' story.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mangan |first=Lucy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/13/look-away-review-horrifying-stories-of-abuse-at-the-hands-of-male-rock-stars |title=Look Away review – horrifying stories of abuse at the hands of male rock stars |work=The Guardian |date=September 13, 2021 |access-date=September 13, 2021}}</ref>

Fuchs said that her last memory of the night was seeing Currie and Jett staring at her as Fowley raped her.<ref name=":0"/> Kari Krome (co-founder and songwriter for the group) stated that she saw, "Jett and Currie sitting off to the side of the room for part of the time, snickering" during the rape.<ref name=":0"/> In 2015, Jett stated "Anyone who truly knows me understands that if I was aware of a friend or bandmate being violated, I would not stand by while it happened. For a group of young teenagers thrust into '70s rock stardom there were relationships that were bizarre, but I was not aware of this incident. Obviously Jackie's story is extremely upsetting and although we haven't spoken in decades, I wish her peace and healing."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://consequence.net/2015/07/joan-jett-on-runaways-jackie-fox-rape-allegations-i-was-not-aware-of-this-incident/ |title=Joan Jett on Runaways' Jackie Fox's rape allegations: "I was not aware of this incident" |work=Consequence |date=July 10, 2015 |access-date=April 4, 2022 |author=Kaye, Ben}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Joan Jett and Cherie Currie Respond to Jackie Fox's Rape Allegations |url=https://jezebel.com/joan-jett-and-cherie-currie-respond-to-jackie-foxs-rape-1717399575 |access-date=October 6, 2020 |work=Jezebel |date=July 13, 2015 |language=en-us}}</ref> [[Victory Tischler-Blue]] (Fuchs's replacement in the group) said that all the members of the group "have always been aware of this ugly event".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Herman |first=Maureen |date=October 21, 2015 |title=The Jackie Fox rape disclosure shows we still have a lot to learn |url=https://boingboing.net/2015/10/21/the-jackie-fox-rape-disclosure.html |access-date=October 6, 2020 |work=Boing Boing |language=en-US}}</ref>
