In an interview for the February 2013 edition of ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' (released in mid-January), Koenig described the album as "darker and more organic" and "very much the last of a trilogy." Said Koenig, "Things that we might have found boring in the past, we've started to find more fresh. This album has more piano and acoustic guitar and organ." ''Modern Vampires of the City'' also continued the use of digital voice modulation as heard in the songs "Diane Young" and "Ya Hey", a technique first used in the song "California English" on ''Contra'' <ref>Eliscu, J.

In March 2017, Koenig revealed in an elaborate Instagram update that during 2016 he had spent countless hours researching and writing music in libraries with grad students. Additionally, he revealed that the album, given the working title of "Mitsubishi Macchiato", would feature a more 'spring-time' vibe and one of the songs would be entitled ''Flower Moon''. Koenig revealed that LP4 would be partially inspired by the songwriting of country singer, [[Kacey Musgraves]], after he attended one of her shows in September 2016. In an interview with [[Stereogum]], he stated, "I'm the type of person who has spent hours poring over the avant-garde poetic lyrics of certain songwriters, and there was something that felt so good [about Musgraves' songs and how] from the first verse, you knew who was singing, who they were singing to, what kind of situation they were in. After the show I realized there's not a ton of Vampire Weekend songs where you could listen to the first verse and immediately answer the question of who's singing and who are they singing to."<ref>{{cite web|title=New Vampire Weekend Album Is Inspired By Kacey Musgraves, Features Ariel Rechtshaid And Rostam|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1975166/new-vampire-weekend-album-is-inspired-by-kacey-musgraves-features-ariel-rechtshaid-and-rostam/news/|website=Stereogum|date=11 December 2017}}</ref> Furthermore, in a September 2017 interview with [[Zane Lowe]], Ezra briefly spoke about ''LP4'' and stated that it was "about 80% done."
