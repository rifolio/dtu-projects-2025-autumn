'''Dashboard Confessional''' is an American [[emo]] band from [[Boca Raton, Florida]], formed in 1999 and led by singer [[Chris Carrabba]].<ref name="Ambrose, Anthony">{{cite web |url = http://intunemusiconline.com/2010/12/07/dashboard-confessional-river-city-extension-cory-branan-john-lefler-nyc-1272010/ |title = inTuneMusicOnline: Dashboard Confessional / River City Extension / Cory Branan / John Lefler @ NYC 12/7/2010 |access-date = March 8, 2011 |last = Ambrose |first = Anthony |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://archive.today/20130126110302/http://intunemusiconline.com/2010/12/07/dashboard-confessional-river-city-extension-cory-branan-john-lefler-nyc-1272010/ |archive-date = January 26, 2013 }}</ref> The name of the band is derived from the song "The Sharp Hint of New Tears" off their debut album, ''[[The Swiss Army Romance]]''.

==History==

===Early history (1999–2002)===
Dashboard Confessional's first recording was the 2000 album ''[[The Swiss Army Romance]]'', initially a solo side project of Chris Carrabba while he was in the band [[Further Seems Forever]]. The following year, [[Further Seems Forever]], with [[Chris Carrabba]], recorded its debut album, ''[[The Moon Is Down (album)|The Moon Is Down]]''. Carrabba left the band before the album was released<ref>{{Cite web|title=Further Seems Forever: A Tale of Three Singers (S1 Ep1)|url=https://soundcloud.com/tooth-and-nail-records/further-seems-forever-a-tale-of-three-singers-s1-ep1|language=en|access-date=November 14, 2018}}</ref> to record and release his second solo album, ''[[The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most]]'', and a follow-up EP, ''So Impossible''; both were released under the name Dashboard Confessional.

By 2002, three other musicians had joined Dashboard Confessional. After the success of his second album, Carrabba was asked to perform on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', and the subsequent [[MTV Unplugged 2.0|live release]] marked the first time many of the songs were recorded with a full band. Also in 2002, the music video for "[[Screaming Infidelities]]" won the MTV2 award at the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, beating out [[Norah Jones]], [[The Strokes]], [[The Hives]], [[Nappy Roots]], and [[Musiq]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilcha|first=Kristin|date=September 6, 2002|title=SuperMega/Palomar and FM Rocks Top MTV Awards|url=http://www.shootonline.com/node/28469|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413011520/https://www.shootonline.com/node/28469|archive-date=April 13, 2016|access-date=|website=SHOOTonline|publisher=DCA Business Media LLC.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458151/20021015/dashboard_confessional.jhtml |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040419003358/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458151/20021015/dashboard_confessional.jhtml |url-status= dead |archive-date= April 19, 2004 |first=Joe|last=D'Angelo|title=New Dashboard Confessional: Still Emotional, But More Musical |date=October 15, 2002|publisher=[[MTV]]|access-date=July 9, 2009}}</ref> This video starred Carrabba in both the performance and the storyline.

===''A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar'' (2003–2005)===
In 2003, Dashboard Confessional released its third album, ''[[A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar]]''. Peaking at No.&nbsp;2 on the United States ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, the album proved to be the band's most commercially viable album yet. In the fall of 2003, Dashboard Confessional toured with [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chicagomaroon.com/2003/10/06/brand-new-gives-the-teenage-girls-tremors-dashboard-goes-unnoticed/|title=Brand New gives the teenage girls tremors; Dashboard goes unnoticed|first=James|last=Cocoran|date=October 6, 2003|work=[[The Chicago Maroon]]}}</ref><ref name="DC_BrandNew">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57213/dashboard-brand-new-re-team-for-fall-tour|date=September 18, 2006|title=Dashboard, Brand New Re-Team for Fall Tour|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2010/11/qa-dashboard-confessionals-chris-carrabba/|title=Q&A: Dashboard Confessional's Chris Carrabba|first=Kevin|last=O'Donnell|date=November 19, 2010|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref>

In the summer of 2004, Dashboard Confessional recorded the song "[[Vindicated (song)|Vindicated]]" for the film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. It was featured on the soundtrack and played over the film's end credits.<ref>{{cite news|last=Valmero|first=Anna| date=May 27, 2010 |url=http://loqal.ph/arts-and-entertainment/2010/05/27/chris-carabba-shares-stories-behind-dashboard-confessionals-music/| title=Chris Carrabba shares stories behind Dashboard Confessional's music|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217075253/http://loqal.ph/arts-and-entertainment/2010/05/27/chris-carabba-shares-stories-behind-dashboard-confessionals-music/ |archive-date=December 17, 2011|work=loQal.ph}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Richardson |first=Sean|date=June 24, 2004|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/events/future/documents/03910180.asp |title=Vindication: Emo superhero Chris Carrabba puts a new spin on ''Spider-Man''| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402062609/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/events/future/documents/03910180.asp |archive-date=April 2, 2013|work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/super/super/view/20100529-272645/Chris-Carrabba-knows-how-to-be-funny|first=Jed-Angelo Q.|last=Segovia|title= Chris Carrabba knows how to be funny|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209101724/http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/super/super/view/20100529-272645/Chris-Carrabba-knows-how-to-be-funny |archive-date=December 9, 2013|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=May 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=kNxzdnZVIp0|title=Dashboard Confessional – Vindicated}}</ref> Due to such usage, the band gained a sizable audience for their next release the following summer, ''[[Dusk and Summer]]''. "Vindicated" was not, however, released on ''A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar'' but was included on most versions and deluxe edition versions of ''Dusk and Summer''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Dashboard-Confessional-Dusk-And-Summer-Deluxe-Edition/release/1288391|title=Dashboard Confessional – ''Dusk and Summer'': Deluxe Edition|publisher=[[Discogs]]|access-date=January 23, 2014}}</ref>

===''Dusk and Summer'' (2005–2006)===
In May 2005, Dashboard Confessional entered the studio to record their fourth album with producer [[Daniel Lanois]]. The album, ''[[Dusk and Summer]]'', was released on June 27, 2006; its first single was "[[Don't Wait (Dashboard Confessional song)|Don't Wait]]". Following the release of ''Dusk and Summer'', Dashboard Confessional went on a summer tour of the U.S. with special guests [[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything]] and [[Ben Lee]],<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.spin.com/2006/05/dashboard-tour-through-dusk-summer/|title=Dashboard to Tour Through Dusk, Summer|date=May 11, 2006|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref> followed by co-headlining an arena tour with [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]].<ref name="DC_BrandNew" />

===''The Shade of Poison Trees'' (2007–2009)===
In 2007, Dashboard Confessional released its follow-up to ''Dusk and Summer'', ''[[The Shade of Poison Trees]].'' Unlike its predecessor, this album reflects back on the earlier influence of Carrabba's acoustic harmonies from ''The Swiss Army Romance'' and ''The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most''.

===''Alter the Ending, The Swiss Army Romance'' re-release (2009–2010)===
Dashboard Confessional began recording their sixth studio album, ''[[Alter the Ending]]'', in 2008. Carrabba stated that the album could have turned into a concept album:<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049381/carrabba-already-14-songs-into-next-dashboard-cd |title=Carrabba Already 14 Songs Into Next Dashboard CD|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| first=Gary|last=Graff|date=September 11, 2007}}</ref>

{{blockquote|...{{nbsp}}only with the last three has it become, like, "All right, these have a continuity, and there's something going on", so I'm excited to see where that leads.}}

On February 14, 2009, as a special [[Valentine's Day]] gift to fans, Carrabba released a free download on his [[MySpace]] page entitled "Even Now (Acoustic Version)" from their forthcoming studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.collegian.com/2009/12/17/dashboard_confessionals_new_album/|title=Dashboard Confessional's new album doesn't ''Alter'' the style|first=Ian|last=Mahan|date=November 10, 2009|work=[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]|access-date=January 23, 2014|archive-date=February 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104513/http://archives.collegian.com/2009/12/17/dashboard_confessionals_new_album/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In June 2009, the band began "sequencing the album," suggesting that the upcoming album was close to completion.

In August 2009, Dashboard Confessional contributed a song to the motion picture soundtrack for the [[dark comedy]] film ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'', titled "Finishing School."<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Zahn|url=http://www.fangoria.com/musick/reviews/3693-jennifers-body-music-from-the-motion-picture-review.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828134408/http://www.fangoria.com/musick/reviews/3693-jennifers-body-music-from-the-motion-picture-review.html |archive-date=August 28, 2009|title=Jennifer's Body – Music from the Motion Picture (Review)|publisher=[[Fangoria]]|date=August 25, 2009 }}</ref> It was not featured on ''Alter the Ending''.

In addition, Carrabba stated that Dashboard Confessional would be touring with [[New Found Glory]] and [[Never Shout Never]] in the near future.<ref>{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Carrabba |url=https://twitter.com/ChrisCarrabba |title=Chris Carrabba (ChrisCarrabba) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=February 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266856/dashboard-confessional-doubles-down-with-alter-the-ending|first=Laura|last=Leebove|title=Dashboard Confessional Doubles Down With 'After The Ending'|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 30, 2009|access-date=November 1, 2009}}</ref> On October 30, 2009, however, Carrabba announced via Twitter and [[Facebook]] that, due to a last-minute family emergency, the band would be cancelling their ''Alter the Ending'' tour with New Found Glory and Never Shout Never with the exception of a November 7 concert with the [[Louisville Orchestra]]. Although the longer tour with New Found Glory and Never Shout Never was cancelled, Carrabba announced on his website on November 10, 2009, that he and John Lefler would begin a 13-date acoustic tour with New Found Glory (who played acoustic sets as well) on November 30, 2009.

'''John C. Lefler''' (born March 18, 1975) is an American songwriter, singer, guitarist, and pianist. He is a former member of Dashboard Confessional.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p454683/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Dashboard Confessional|last=Leahey|first=Andrew|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=May 28, 2010}}</ref> Lefler has a been an freelance graphic designer since 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/johnleflerdesign/|title=John Lefler Design|website=facebook.com|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=March 2020}}

Lefler is from [[Sugar Land, Texas]]. He attended Dulles High School and graduated high school in 1993. He attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and graduated in 1997 with a degree in fine art. Lefler started playing guitar in 1989 and piano shortly thereafter. His first instrument was a PVT-60 which his father had purchased from a pawn shop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/john-lefler-my-voice-sounded-like-keanu-reeves-trying-to-be-dramatic-in-the-rush-rush-video-7071801|title=John Lefler: 'My Voice Sounded Like Keanu Reeves Trying To Be Dramatic In The "Rush, Rush" Video'|last=Grubbs|first=Eric|date=May 2, 2012|website=Dallas Observer|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> He started writing songs when he was about 18 years old, after seeing the [[John Lennon]] bio-pic, ''Imagine''. Lefler had piano lessons for a few months while in high school. "My recital piece was [[Bruce Hornsby]]'s "The Way It Is". It was terrible. I've never had another lesson (or recital) of any kind since."{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} When describing his piano technique, he stated, "I tend to play the piano with my fists more than anything."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mezzic.com/2012/04/19/interview-john-lefler-dallas/|title=Interview: John Lefler (Dallas) – Mezzic|date=April 19, 2012 |access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref>

Lefler joined Dashboard Confessional in 2002 after having flown out to meet the rest of the band in Florida. In less than two weeks, Lefler made his first official appearance as a Dashboard Confessional member on the ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' recording.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/the-black-keys-retain-their-basement-day-alchemy-while-rocking-dickies-arena-11801590|title=The Black Keys Rocked Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, But Tastefully|last=Jones|first=Preston|date=November 15, 2019|website=Dallas Observer|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> He left on his own accord after the band's hiatus began in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themorningsun.com/news/nation-world-news/sound-check-dasbhoard-confessional-rejuvinated-after-hiatus/article_51f4c6a1-08ec-5616-9389-1b2d9b280e1f.html|title=Sound Check: Dasbhoard Confessional rejuvenated [sic] after hiatus|last=Twitter|first=Gary Graff ggraff@digitalfirstmedia com, @GraffonMusic on|website=The Morning Sun|access-date=November 19, 2019}}{{Dead link|date=August 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/dashboard-confessional-s-chris-carrabba-don-t-call-it-a-comeback-7639903|title=Dashboard Confessional's Chris Carrabba: 'Don't Call It a Comeback'|last=Zimmerman|first=Lee|date=May 26, 2015|website=Miami New Times|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref>

In 2005, Lefler and his brothers Bill and Kevin formed an alternative-country band called The Wimbledons in Los Angeles, California. After much infighting between the brothers, the band completed ''The Wimbledons EP'' on Lefler's own label, Goodhang Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-wimbledons-ep-mw0000313301|title=The Wimbledons EP – The Wimbledons {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> Being influenced by bands like [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]], [[Ben Folds]], [[Crowded House]], [[The Police]], [[The Beatles]], and [[U2]], Lefler released ''Better By Design'' in June 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/John-Lefler-Better-By-Design/release/12331812|title=John Lefler – Better By Design|publisher=discogs|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> ''Better By Design'' was co-produced by Lefler, along with friends [[Salim Nourallah]] and Rip Rowan.
