==History==

===Formation and early years (2002–2004)===
The band members' musical lives were largely formed in Denver area churches where they helped lead worship, and in the Christian school three of them attended. Isaac Slade and guitarist Joe King were several years ahead of drummer Ben Wysocki at Faith Christian Academy. Wysocki and guitarist David Welsh played in the same worship band. In the spring of 2002, former schoolmates Slade and King reconnected and began regular two-man jam sessions that led to writing songs. Slade and King later added Mike Ayars on guitar, Zach Johnson on drums,<ref name="lost">{{Cite web |title=The Lost Members |url=http://www.frayawaytheedges.net/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109012915/http://www.frayawaytheedges.net/ |archive-date=January 9, 2007 |access-date=August 29, 2021 |website=Fray Away the Edges |location=About the Guys: The Lost Members}}</ref> and Slade's younger brother Caleb on bass, though Caleb was later asked to leave. Caleb's departure from the band caused a rift in his relationship with Isaac, and this rift later became the inspiration for the song "[[Over My Head (Cable Car)]]", which is about the brothers' waning relationship.<ref name="Gitlin">{{Cite magazine |last=Gitlin |first=Lauren |date=August 10, 2006 |title=Enter the Fray |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Following this Johnson left the band to attend an art school in New York.<ref name="lost" />

Ben Wysocki, a former bandmate of Isaac Slade, joined as drummer and later, Dave Welsh, who was another former bandmate of Slade and Wysocki, was added as lead guitarist to the band. The newly formed band was named the Fray. The band members decided on a name after asking people to put band names on a piece of paper from which they picked randomly. The members of the band first claimed that they found the name suitable because they frequently quarreled about the composition of the lyrics in their songs, but they have since stated they are usually on good terms while composing music and acknowledge contributions from all members.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tomlinson |first=Sarah |date=February 24, 2006 |title=Life Less Ordinary |work=The Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2006/02/24/life_less_ordinary/ |access-date=February 13, 2010}}</ref> The band has had no permanent bassist since Caleb, instead employing touring bassists on a temporary basis. The current bassist is Dane Poppin, who has been touring with the band since 2022.

The band released its first record, ''[[Movement EP]]'', in 2002. The next year, the band released ''[[Reason (The Fray EP)|Reason EP]]'' produced by "How To Save A Life" co-producer [[Aaron Johnson (musician)|Aaron Johnson]], which garnered the band local fame and acclaim.<ref name="westword.com">{{Cite web |date=December 16, 2004 |title=Let Us Fray |url=http://www.westword.com/2004-12-16/music/let-us-fray/ |access-date=April 5, 2010 |publisher=Westword.com}}</ref><ref name="allmusic.com">{{Cite web |title=The Fray biography |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p710897|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=April 5, 2010 |publisher=Allmusic.com}}</ref> ''[[Westword]]'', an [[alternative weekly|alternative newsweekly]], gave ''Reason EP'' a positive review, stating "The music is epic, no doubt, but it's played on a wholly human scale".<ref>{{Cite news |date=February 19, 2004 |title=The Fray: ''Reason EP'' (Self-Released) |publisher=Westword.com |url=http://www.westword.com/2004-02-19/music/the-fray |access-date=April 5, 2010}}</ref> Despite these reviews, the band struggled to launch a single; Denver radio station [[KTCL]] rejected eight of their songs before the band decided to submit a demo of a song then-named "Cable Car". The song found airplay on a KTCL radio show highlighting local bands, and the radio station received a large number of requests for it soon thereafter.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Smith |first=Dane |date=March 30, 2006 |title=The Fray Live the High "Life" |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9550361/the_fray_live_the_high_life |url-status=dead |magazine=RollingStone.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060915054423/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9550361/the_fray_live_the_high_life |archive-date=September 15, 2006 |access-date=February 13, 2010}}</ref> The band changed the name of the song to "Over My Head (Cable Car)", and as the song's airplay increased alongside their local following, the band was voted "Best New Band" by ''Westword'' in 2004.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> Mike Flynn, working in the [[artists and repertoire]] division of [[Epic Records]], discovered the band through the article in ''Westword''<ref name="westword.com" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=May 12, 2006 |title=Completely Frayed |publisher=Longmont Daily Times-Call}}</ref> and soon after, Epic Records officially signed the band on December 17, 2004.

He adds the band wants to model the rest of their careers after this second album. On February 13, 2009, the Fray wrote a song called "Be the One". The song was written in the space of 24 hours when the British magazine [[Q magazine|''Q'']] asked the band to write a love song for the occasion of [[Valentine's Day]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=The Fray's Valentine's Day songwriting challenge |publisher=Westword.com |url=http://blogs.westword.com/backbeat/2009/02/the_frays_valentines_day_songw.php |access-date=April 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Hear The Fray's exclusive Q Challenge track here |url=http://news.q4music.com/2009/01/hear_the_frays_exclusive_q_cha.html |access-date=February 17, 2010 |publisher=News.Q4Music.com}}</ref>

The band released "[[Never Say Never (The Fray song)|Never Say Never]]" as the second single from the album.

Like their first album, ''The Fray''{{'s}} critical reception was mixed.
