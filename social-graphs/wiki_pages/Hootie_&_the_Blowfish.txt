==History==
===Early years===
[[Darius Rucker]] and [[Mark Bryan]] met in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], in the mid-1980s when they were both freshmen at the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref name="RollingStone2005">Bashe, P. R., & George-Warren, H., ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' (Third ed.). New York, Fireside, 2005, p. 443</ref> Bryan, a guitar player, heard Rucker singing in the showers of the dormitory they shared and was impressed by his vocal ability. The pair began playing [[cover version|cover]] tunes as the Wolf Brothers.

Eventually, they collaborated with bassist Dean Felber, a former high school bandmate of Bryan, and Brantley Smith, a drummer. In 1986, they adopted the name Hootie & the Blowfish, a conjunction of the nicknames of two of their college friends,<ref name="hoot_Hoot">{{Cite web |title=Hootie & the Blowfish |url=http://www.hootie.com/about/ |access-date=January 1, 2015 |website=hootie.com |quote=The unlikely moniker was borrowed from the nicknames of two college friends}}</ref> one who wore huge, round glasses that made him look like an owl the other with big, puffy cheeks that made him look like a blowfish.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hootie & the Blowfish |url=https://americansongwriter.com/behind-the-band-name-hootie-the-blowfish/ |access-date=July 1, 2025 |website=americansongwriter.com |quote=Lead singer Darius Rucker was inspired by the nicknames of two college buddies: One wore huge, round glasses that made him look like an owl; the other had big, puffy cheeks that made him look like a blowfish (a tiny fish that swallows air and water to puff itself up). One night these two guys walked into a campus party where the band was playing. Rucker saw them and yelled, 'Look, Hootie and the Blowfish.'}}.</ref> The band is routinely featured in articles and polls about badly-named bands.<ref>{{Cite web |date=13 January 2012 |title=The Worst Band Names Ever - NME |url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-worst-band-names-ever-780296 |website=Nme.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Gelfand |first=Michael |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GC_HDgAAQBAJ&q=hootie+&pg=PT92 |title=Strategies for Success: Self-Promotion Secrets for Musicians |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=Schirmer Trade Books |isbn=9780857121974 |via=Google Books}}</ref> Rucker is often mistakenly labeled as being the "Hootie" in the band's name.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rock On The Net: Hootie & The Blowfish / Darius Rucker |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-h/hootieandtheblowfish_main.htm |access-date=December 8, 2019 |website=Rockonthenet.com}}</ref> Smith left the group after finishing college to pursue music ministry, but he has made scattered guest appearances with the band (he played cello on their ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' performance in 1996 and played drums at Gruene Hall in [[Gruene, Texas]], on June 27, 2008). Smith was replaced full time in 1989 by Jim "Soni" Sonefeld. The band's lineup has remained the same ever since.

The band independently released two cassette demo [[Extended play|EP]]s in 1991 and 1992.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} In 1993, they pressed 50,000 copies of a self-released EP, ''[[Kootchypop]]''. They were signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in August 1993 after being discovered by Atlantic [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative [[Tim Sommer]], a former music journalist and member of the art rock band [[Hugo Largo]].<ref name="sommer">{{Cite web |last=Sommer |first=Tim |date=14 July 2016 |title=My Life in the Bush of Hootie: How I Signed the Biggest Band of 1995 |url=http://observer.com/2016/07/my-life-in-the-bush-of-hootie-how-i-signed-the-biggest-band-of-1995/ |access-date=16 July 2016 |website=Observer}}</ref> Sommer recalled that other record labels were uninterested in signing Hootie & The Blowfish because their sound was radically different from the [[grunge]] music that was popular at the time.<ref name="sommer" />

===1994–1995: ''Cracked Rear View'' and mainstream success===
Their mainstream debut album was ''[[Cracked Rear View]]'' (1994). Released in July 1994, the album's popularity grew after its release, becoming the best-selling album of 1995, and was one of the fastest-selling debut albums of all time. The album was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] in the United States in January 1995, and incrementally rose to 12× platinum by January 1996, and 16× platinum by March 1999. In May 2019, the certification was updated from 16× platinum to 21× platinum.

The album featured four hits, "[[Hold My Hand (Hootie & the Blowfish song)|Hold My Hand]]" (U.S. No. 10), "[[Let Her Cry (song)|Let Her Cry]]" (U.S. No. 9), "[[Only Wanna Be with You]]" (U.S. No.&nbsp;6), and "[[Time (Hootie & the Blowfish song)|Time]]" (U.S. No. 14).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{Cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |title=The Great Rock Discography |publisher=Mojo Books |year=2000 |isbn=1-84195-017-3 |edition=5th |location=Edinburgh |page=459}}</ref> The album's last single, "[[Drowning (Hootie & the Blowfish song)|Drowning]]", was not as successful as its predecessors, peaking only on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart. In 1995, Hootie & the Blowfish and [[Bob Dylan]] reached an out-of-court settlement for the group's unauthorized use of Dylan's lyrics in their song "Only Wanna Be with You".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/rock_clock/11_3/index.jhtml?rsspartner=rssMozilla |title=Rock Clock - November 3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001030628/http://www.vh1.com/news/rock_clock/11_3/index.jhtml?rsspartner=rssMozilla |archive-date=October 1, 2007 |website=VH1 |access-date=May 25, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Miami Dolphins]]' Hall of Fame quarterback [[Dan Marino]] appeared along with several other athletes in the band's [[music video|video]] for the song "Only Wanna Be with You".<ref>Hootie and the Blowfish.

===1996–1997: ''Fairweather Johnson'' and promotional singles===
In 1995, Hootie & the Blowfish contributed the song "[[Hey, Hey, What Can I Do]]" to the ''[[Encomium (album)|Encomium]]'' tribute album to [[Led Zeppelin]]. Their [[cover version|cover]] of Canadian group [[54-40 (band)|54-40]]'s "[[I Go Blind]]", released on the soundtrack to the television series ''[[Friends]]'' in 1995, did not appear on ''Cracked Rear View'' or ''Fairweather Johnson'', but it became a hit on radio in 1996 after three singles from ''Fairweather Johnson'' had been released. Both "Hey, Hey, What Can I Do" and "I Go Blind" were later released on the compilation ''Scattered, Smothered and Covered''.

On February 28, 1996, at the [[38th Annual Grammy Awards]], Hootie & the Blowfish won the Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (for the single "Let Her Cry") and the Grammy for "Best New Artist".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/hootie-blowfish/16330|title=Hootie & the Blowfish |website=Grammy.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9602/grammy_pm/|title=CNN - Morrissette, Hootie big Grammy winners |website=www.cnn.com |date=February 29, 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/darius-rucker-my-grammy-moment-5885248/|title=Darius Rucker: My GRAMMY Moment|website=Billboard.com |date=January 24, 2014}}</ref> The band appeared on ''MTV Unplugged'' on the eve of the release of their second album, ''[[Fairweather Johnson]]'' (1996).

The band kept to an extensive touring schedule, including an annual New Year's Eve show at [[Silverton Las Vegas]] (formerly known as Boomtown Las Vegas) in [[Enterprise, Nevada]].

The band released a [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and rarities [[compilation album|compilation]] titled ''[[Scattered, Smothered and Covered]]'' (2000). This album is named in tribute of [[Waffle House]], a popular Southern chain of all-night diners. Specifically, the title refers to an order of [[hash browns]]—shredded potatoes scattered on the grill, smothered with diced onions, and covered with melted cheese.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/03/hootie.sessions/index.html Hootie & the Blowfish like songs "covered".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319162913/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/03/hootie.sessions/index.html |date=2007-03-19 }} Cnn.com Archive, November 3, 2000.

[[Tim Sommer]], the band's A&R representative at Atlantic Records, said Hootie & The Blowfish donated all the proceeds from a Seattle concert in the 1990s to a rape crisis group that had been set up in memory of [[Mia Zapata]], the lead singer of the punk band [[The Gits]], who had been murdered in 1993.
