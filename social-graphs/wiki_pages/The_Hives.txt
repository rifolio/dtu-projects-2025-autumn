'''The Hives''' are a Swedish [[garage rock]] band formed in [[Fagersta]] in 1993. After gaining success in Sweden throughout the 1990s, they rose to worldwide prominence in the early 2000s during the [[Post-punk revival|garage rock revival]]. The band's line-up{{emdash}}consisting of [[Howlin' Pelle Almqvist]] (vocals), [[Nicholaus Arson]] (lead guitar, backing vocals), [[Vigilante Carlstroem]] (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), [[Dr. Matt Destruction]] (bass), and [[Chris Dangerous]] (drums){{emdash}}remained unchanged from 1993 until 2013, when Matt Destruction retired for health reasons and was replaced by The Johan and Only, the former [[Randy (band)|Randy]] bassist.

The Hives have released seven studio albums: ''[[Barely Legal (album)|Barely Legal]]'' (1997), ''[[Veni Vidi Vicious]]'' (2000), ''[[Tyrannosaurus Hives]]'' (2004), ''[[The Black and White Album]]'' (2007), ''[[Lex Hives]]'' (2012), ''[[The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons]]'' (2023), and ''[[The Hives Forever Forever The Hives (album)|The Hives Forever Forever The Hives]]'' (2025). They have also released the compilation album ''[[Your New Favourite Band]]'' (2001), the live DVD ''[[Tussles in Brussels]]'' (2005), and the live album ''Live at Third Man Records'' (2020). Their mainstream success came with the release of ''Veni Vidi Vicious'' and its single "[[Hate to Say I Told You So]]", considered their [[signature song]]. They are known for always dressing in matching black-and-white [[tuxedo]]s and for their energetic and eccentric live shows, with critics hailing them as one of the best live rock bands of the last two decades.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Duerden |first1=Nick |title=The Hottest Band on Earth Should Get Everything They Want, No? |url=https://www.spin.com/2007/11/hottest-band-earth-should-get-everything-they-want-no/ |access-date=30 August 2018 |work=Spin (magazine) |date=2 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVuFuZEeUX0C&pg=PA18 |title=Spin Magazine 2004, The Hives |date=August 2004 |publisher=Spin Magazine |access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="Booton">{{Cite web |last=Booton |first=James |date=7 August 2023 |title="We Want That Rock And Roll Feeling!" – The Hives Speak Out |url=https://www.clashmusic.com/features/we-want-that-rock-and-roll-feeling-the-hives-speak-out/ |access-date=13 October 2023 |website=Clash |language=en-GB}}</ref>

==History==
===Beginnings of the Hives (1993–1999)===
The Hives was formed in 1993 by brothers [[Pelle Almqvist|Per "Pelle" Almqvist]] (Howlin' Pelle Almqvist) and [[Niklas Almqvist]] (Nicholaus Arson) in [[Fagersta]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=23 September 2014 |title=The Hives: The Boys Who Kicked The Hornets' Nest |url=https://magnetmagazine.com/2014/09/23/the-hives-the-boys-who-kicked-the-hornets-nest/ |access-date=13 October 2023 |website=Magnet Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> Friends of the brothers, [[Vigilante Carlstroem|Mikael Karlsson]] (Vigilante Carlstroem), [[Dr. Matt Destruction|Mattias Bernvall]] (Dr. Matt Destruction) and [[Christian Grahn]] (Chris Dangerous), soon joined the band and took punk rock-inspired stage names like the brothers.<ref name=":0" /> Drummer Dangerous suggested the name "Hives" for the band as he had read the word for the [[Hives|skin disease]] in a dictionary.<ref name=":0" /> The other members misunderstood the condition based on his description of it, as Howlin' Pelle later explained, "we thought it was a way more lethal disease, for one, and we thought it was way more contagious. So, we figured that we'd spread like a deadly disease across the land". The band went by the name Hives for some time before they realized that "all good band names are plurals", and added a 'the' to their name.<ref name=":0" />

The band's first recording was a 1994 demo titled ''Sounds Like Sushi''. In 1995, the band signed with [[Burning Heart Records]], a Swedish [[independent record label]]. The following year they released their debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Oh Lord! When? How?]]'' In 1997, the band released their debut studio album, ''[[Barely Legal (album)|Barely Legal]],'' and embarked on a tour in support of it. The ''Barely Legal'' track "The Stomp" was later featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[RocknRolla]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032755/soundtrack|title=RocknRolla (2008)|access-date=31 March 2018|publisher=IMDb}}</ref> The band's early releases would be marked by the influence of such bands as [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[New Bomb Turks]], [[Turbonegro]], and [[Dead Kennedys]].<ref>{{Cite web |year=2024 |title=The Hives |url=https://scabzine.tripod.com/hives.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240915154404/https://scabzine.tripod.com/hives.htm |archive-date=15 September 2024 |access-date=15 September 2024 |website=S.C.A.B. zine}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kaplan |first=Ilana |date=6 June 2012 |title=The Hives are Abuzz Again |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/the-hives-lex-hives |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240530003225/https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/the-hives-lex-hives |archive-date=30 May 2024 |access-date=15 September 2024 |website=Interview |quote=You start listening to music at a very young age.

In 1998, the band released their second EP, ''[[A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T]]''. Burning Heart signed a deal with [[Epitaph Records]] to distribute the band's material in the United States during that same year.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=4 August 2002 |title=Hives' Signing Creates a Hornet's Nest |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-aug-04-ca-popeye4-story.html |access-date=13 October 2023 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref>

===''Veni Vidi Vicious'' and ''Your New Favourite Band'' (2000–2002)===
The Hives released their second studio album, ''[[Veni Vidi Vicious]],'' in April 2000 through Burning Heart Records. The band members described the album as being like "a velvet glove with brass knuckles, both brutal and sophisticated at the same time". The album yielded the singles "[[Hate to Say I Told You So]]", "[[Main Offender (song)|Main Offender]]", "Die, All Right!", and "Supply and Demand". The album track "The Hives – Introduce the Metric System in Time" was included on the punk rock compilation album ''[[Punk-O-Rama#Punk-O-Rama #5 (2000)|Punk-O-Rama Volume 5]]'' from Epitaph later that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/punk-o-rama-vol-5-mw0000066378 |title=– Punk-O-Rama Vol. 5 |work=AllMusic |access-date=11 May 2014}}</ref> "Hate To Say I Told You So" was later included on the soundtrack for [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|''Spider-Man'']], and also featured in the video game [[Forza Horizon]] . The track "Main Offender" was featured in the video game ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' while "Die, All Right!" was released as downloadable content in the game's digital music store.

After seeing the video for "Hate to Say I Told You So" on German television, industry executive [[Alan McGee]] decided to sign the band to his newly formed [[Poptones]] label. Poptones released the 'best of' compilation ''[[Your New Favourite Band]]'' in 2001, which proved to be the band's breakthrough record, reaching number seven on the [[UK Albums Chart|UK album charts]]. Following the success of the album, the band re-released the singles "Hate to Say I Told You So" and "Main Offender", which reached number 23 and 24 respectively on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The band also re-released ''Veni Vidi Vicious'' in the US.

During the promotion of ''Veni Vidi Vicious'' and ''Your New Favourite Band'', the Hives signed a record deal with [[Universal Music]], reportedly worth $10&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last1=August 22 |first1=Brian Hiatt Updated |last2=EDT |first2=2002 at 04:00&nbsp;am |title=Sweden's the Hives on their next album and more |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/08/22/swedens-hives-their-next-album-and-more/ |access-date=13 October 2023 |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |language=en}}</ref> The signing was a result of Epitaph selling the rights to the band's material in the US to [[Warner Bros. Records]] without informing the members beforehand.<ref name=":0"/> A dispute followed between the Hives and the labels, who claimed that the band were still contracted for one more album, in which a lawsuit was filed against the band and settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=23 July 2002 |title=Hives Sign Worldwide Deal With Universal |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/hives-sign-worldwide-deal-with-universal-74995/ |access-date=13 October 2023 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0"/>

In 2005, the band won five Swedish [[Grammis]] awards in the categories "Artist of the Year", "Rock Group of the Year", "Album of the Year", "Producer of the Year" (with collaborator, Pelle Gunnerfeldt), while the video for "Walk Idiot Walk" won the [[MTV]] "Best Music Video" award.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhQEAAAAMBAJ&q=swedish%20grammis%20the%20hives&pg=PA58 |title=Billboard |date=19 February 2005 |access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/shownews.asp?H=The-Hives-on-form-in-Sweden&nItemID=4699 |title=The Hives on form in Sweden |publisher=Music-News.com |date=29 January 2009 |access-date=9 April 2012}}</ref>

All songwriting except covers on the band's albums are credited to "Randy Fitzsimmons". The band claims Fitzsimmons was an honorary "sixth Hive", who along with writing their music, discovered and managed the band. The band has included hidden references to a sixth member of the band, including a hidden sixth pair of legs on the back cover of the ''Tyrannosaurus Hives'' album art. "Randy Fitzsimmons" is a registered pseudonym for guitarist Niklas Almqvist.<ref name="randy">{{cite web|title=You Randy Devil!|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-hives-52-1375634|website=NME|access-date=10 February 2018|date=13 February 2002|quote=Randy Fitzsimmons, ... is none other than&nbsp;– Nicholaus himself}}</ref>
