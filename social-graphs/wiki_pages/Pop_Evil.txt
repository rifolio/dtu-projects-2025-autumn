== History ==

=== Early years (2001–2007) ===
The band was formed from pieces of other Michigan bands in 2001, including a group known as TenFive, which consisted of Kakaty, guitarists Tom Grasman and Jason Reed, bassist James Schaap, and drummer Dylan Allison. As TenFive, Kakaty and Reed recorded a debut album, ''Severn'', and another EP, ''Dam Electro'', on their own independent label. Shortly thereafter, TenFive broke up and Kakaty founded Pop Evil with Allison.<ref name="allmusic1"/>

Kakaty and the members of Pop Evil endured years of playing the clubs without much to show for it. Kakaty said "It was years of bologna sandwiches, playing so many cover shows until the early morning hours because we needed money to make good demos."<ref name="epple1">{{cite web|url=https://www.journal-news.com/entertainment/arts--theater/pop-evil-singer-talks-about-band-trying-times/paTw3FLR8kWrFvZkfU3lgK/|title=Pop Evil's singer talks about band's trying times|last=Epple|first=Aaron|website=journal-news|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> The singer also endured his share of heartache when his girlfriend died in tragic circumstances in 2004.<ref name="epple1"/>

They then independently released an album, ''War of the Roses'' (2004), and a three-song EP, ''Ready or Not'' (2006). The latter featured the concert favorite "Somebody Like You". They also  filmed a music video of the single released in 2006 starring Rossi Morreale and Britt Koth.

In November 2007, Pop Evil was referred by a music talent scout, Tracy Jule  to Erik Quintero, which began Pop Evil's success. In 2008,  Pop Evil  signed a management deal with G&G Entertainment.

=== ''Lipstick on the Mirror'' (2008–2009) ===
Pop Evil's debut studio album, ''[[Lipstick on the Mirror]]'', was released August 12, 2008, and featured radio favorites "Hero", "Somebody Like You", "[[100 in a 55]]", and "Stepping Stone".<ref name="allmusic2">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/pop-evil-mn0000981727/biography|title=Pop Evil Biography|work=AllMusic|author=Deming, Mark|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> The album was released on Pazzo Music through a [[Universal Music Group]] subsidiary, [[Fontana Distribution]]. The band offered a free, special edition of the album to their devoted local fans at a concert at The Intersection in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], on May 29, 2008.

The band worked with producer [[Al Sutton]] ([[Kid Rock]]) at Rustbelt Studios in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], and Chuck Alkazian at Pearl Sound in [[Canton, Michigan]], for ''Lipstick on the Mirror.''

In April 2008, Pop Evil released their first national radio single "Hero", which peaked inside the top 25 at Active Rock radio.

In November 2008, Pop Evil released "100 in a 55" to rock radio.

On March 6, 2009, the band announced at a live show in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], that they had signed with Universal Records, and shortly after, the band went into Mackinaw Harvest Music Studios to remix and remaster ''Lipstick on the Mirror'' and an acoustic version of "100 in a 55" produced by Michael Crittenden (Drew Nelson, Kimber Cleveland).

In April 2009, Pop Evil signed a deal with Cherry Lane Publishing.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

In May 2009, the band released the remixed/remastered ''Lipstick on the Mirror'' through Universal Republic Records. The Republic release was Engineered/Produced/Mixed by Chuck Alkazian and mastered by Chris Bellman of Bernie Grundman Mastering.  The single "100 in a 55" peaked on the Active Rock charts at No.&nbsp;8 making it one of the longest standing singles at Active Rock in 2009. The song was on the chart for 30 weeks. A "Pop Edit" version of "100 in a 55" was also released to mainstream/Top 40 radio. The vocals are mixed louder in this version, and the guitars and drums are less intense.

In July and August 2009, along with [[Whitesnake]], Pop Evil supported [[Judas Priest]] on the British Steel 30th Anniversary North American tour.

In July 2009 the band gave the fans the chance to pick their next single. After the voting had concluded, "Breathe" was announced as the new single. The single peaked at No.&nbsp;29 on the Active Rock charts.

===''War of Angels'' (2010–2012)===
In January 2010, the band announced they were heading back into the studio to record a new album, ''War of Angels''.  In June 2010, the band announced that Johnny K would be the producer of the album.  The name of the album signifies the struggle people experience when trying to leave their pasts behind.

In September 2010, the band debuted the first single from ''War of Angels'', "[[Last Man Standing (Pop Evil song)|Last Man Standing]]", in an exclusive video with UFC fighter Frank Mir.
The single was later featured on the NHL Network for the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, the NFL on Fox Post game show for the 2011 NFC Championship game between the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers, several episodes of NASCAR on Fox and ESPN's SportsCenter, and on the July 8th 2011 episode of ESPN 2 Friday Night Fights.  "Last Man Standing" peaked at No.&nbsp;5 on the Active Radio charts.

In April 2011, the band played "[[Monster You Made]]" live acoustically on the [[Bubba the Love Sponge|Bubba the Love Sponge Show]] and stated it was a song the band hoped might be an album single.

''War of Angels'' was originally expected to be released February 8, 2011, but in a press release on February 1, 2011, the band announced that ''War of Angels'' would be delayed due to "conflicts out of the bands control".

On May 22, 2011, at a concert in [[Columbus, Ohio]], the band symbolically ripped up their contract with Universal Music and announced a new deal with eOne Music. The band would later announce that ''War of Angels'' would be released nationally on July 5, 2011.  The album was also later released as a Deluxe Edition with four bonus tracks only available on [[iTunes]] and at the band's live shows.

In June 2011, the band released the second single from its upcoming ''War of Angels'' album called "Monster You Made".
Shortly after the band filmed a video for the single, drummer Dylan Allison had emergency surgery on a fractured vertebra in his neck and would not be able to perform with the band for an unspecified amount of time. Michigan drummer Josh Marunde (nicknamed "Chachi Riot") began filling in for the missing Allison. The band did not specify if or when Allison would return.  The video for "Monster You Made" debuted on July 13, 2011.

Over the course of 2011, the band toured with [[Drowning Pool]], [[Trust Company (band)|Trust Company]], and [[Anew Revolution]], later heading out with [[Papa Roach]], [[Finger Eleven]], and [[Escape the Fate]], and late in the year with [[3 Doors Down]] and [[Theory of a Deadman]], while rounding out 2011 on a small tour with [[Puddle of Mudd]] as well as a few headlining shows of their own.
