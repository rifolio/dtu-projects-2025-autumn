'''Stephen Lawrence Winwood''' (born 12 May 1948) is an English musician and songwriter whose genres include [[blue-eyed soul]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[blues rock]], and [[pop rock]]. Though primarily a guitarist, keyboard player, and vocalist prominent for his distinctive [[Soul music|soulful]] high [[tenor]] voice, Winwood also plays instruments including [[mandolin]], bass, drums and percussion.

Winwood achieved fame during the 1960s and 1970s as an integral member of three successful bands: [[the Spencer Davis Group]] (1964–1967), [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] (1967–1969 and 1970–1974), and [[Blind Faith]] (1969). During the 1980s, his solo career flourished and he had a number of hit singles, including "[[While You See a Chance]]" (1980) from the album ''[[Arc of a Diver]]'' and "[[Valerie (Steve Winwood song)|Valerie]]" (1982) from ''[[Talking Back to the Night]]'' ("Valerie" became a hit when it was re-released with a remix from Winwood's 1987 compilation album ''[[Chronicles (Steve Winwood album)|Chronicles]]'').

Winwood's 1986 album ''[[Back in the High Life]]'' marked his career zenith, with hit singles including "[[Back in the High Life Again]]", "[[The Finer Things (song)|The Finer Things]]", and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hit "[[Higher Love]]". He reached number one on the Hot 100 again with "[[Roll with It (Steve Winwood song)|Roll with It]]" (1988) from the album [[Roll with It (album)|''Roll with It'']], with "[[Don't You Know What the Night Can Do?]]" and "[[Holding On (Steve Winwood song)|Holding On]]" also charting highly the same year. Although his hit singles ceased after the 1980s, he continued to release new albums. His most recent album, ''[[Nine Lives (Steve Winwood album)|Nine Lives]]'', was released in 2008. The 2004 song "[[Call on Me (Eric Prydz song)|Call on Me]]", built on a sample of "Valerie", spent five weeks at No. 1 on the [[UK singles chart]].

In 2004, Winwood was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Traffic. He has won two [[Grammy Awards]] and an [[Ivor Novello Award]], and has been honored as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Icon. In 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Winwood the 33rd-greatest singer. In 2025, Winwood was appointed a [[Member of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the King's [[2025 Birthday Honours|Birthday Honours]].

==Career==
===Early years===
While still a pupil at Great Barr School, Winwood was a part of the Birmingham [[blues rock]] scene, playing the [[Hammond Organ|Hammond C-3 organ]] and guitar, backing [[blues]] and rock legends such as [[Muddy Waters]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[B. B. King]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Bo Diddley]] on their United Kingdom tours,{{citation needed|date=July 2023}} the custom at that time being for US singers to travel solo and be backed by [[pickup group|pick-up band]]s. At this time, Winwood was living on Atlantic Road in Kingstanding, close to the Birmingham music halls where he played. Winwood modelled his singing after [[Ray Charles]].<ref name=soul/>

In 1964, the Spencer Davis Group signed their first recording contract with [[Island Records]].

He's a musical genius and because he was with Island all the other talent really wanted to be with Island."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYU9U4Kw8KI|title=Bono Inducts Chris Blackwell into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|date=13 February 2008 |via=[[YouTube]]|access-date=26 February 2019|archive-date=23 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523081301/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYU9U4Kw8KI|url-status=live}}</ref> The group's first single "[[Dimples (song)|Dimples]]" was released 10 days after Winwood's 16th birthday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/artist/the-spencer-davis-group/uk |title=The Spencer Davis Group Discography – UK |website=45cat.com |access-date=18 April 2020 |archive-date=20 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220024116/http://www.45cat.com/artist/the-spencer-davis-group/uk |url-status=live }}</ref>

Early in Traffic's formation, Winwood and Capaldi formed a songwriting partnership, with Winwood writing music to match Capaldi's lyrics. This partnership was the source of most of Traffic's material, including popular songs such as "[[Paper Sun]]", "No Face, No Name, No Number", "Dear Mr. Fantasy", and "[[The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys (song)|The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys]]", and outlived the band, producing several songs for Winwood's and Capaldi's solo albums. Over the band's history, Winwood performed the majority of their lead vocals, keyboard instruments, and guitars, guitars more so after Mason's departure in 1968. Traffic disbanded in early 1969 after two albums, ''[[Mr. Fantasy]]'' (1967) and ''[[Traffic (Traffic album)|Traffic]]'' (1968), with a third album, ''[[Last Exit (Traffic album)|Last Exit]]'', being issued later that year.

Following Traffic's split, Winwood formed the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Blind Faith]], along with former [[Cream (band)|Cream]] members [[Eric Clapton]] (guitar) and [[Ginger Baker]] (drums), and former [[Family (band)|Family]] member [[Ric Grech]] (bass).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/herald/steves-still-winning-nine-lives-later/27886690.html|title=Steve's still winning nine lives later|work=Herald.ie|date=26 September 2008 |access-date=29 September 2014|archive-date=13 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213114929/http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/music/steves-still-winning-nine-lives-later-1483044.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The band produced only [[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|one album]], which reached No. 1 in both the UK and US, and included "[[Can't Find My Way Home]]". The band was short-lived owing to Clapton's greater interest in Blind Faith's opening act on tour, [[Delaney & Bonnie & Friends]]; Clapton left the band at the tour's completion, bringing Blind Faith to an end.

[[File:Steve Winwood with Traffic.jpg|thumb|170px|Winwood in 1973 on stage with Traffic]]
In 1970, Winwood went into the studio to begin work on a solo album, tentatively titled ''Mad Shadows''. Winwood ended up calling in his former Traffic bandmates Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood to help, with the recording resulting in a Traffic reunion album ''[[John Barleycorn Must Die]]''.<ref name=Perciaccante/> Traffic would continue for another five albums, ''[[Welcome to the Canteen]]'' (1971), ''[[The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys]]'' (1971), ''[[Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory]]'' (1973), ''[[On the Road (Traffic album)|On the Road]]'' (1973) and ''[[When the Eagle Flies]]'' (1974). Weariness with the grind of touring and recording prompted Winwood to break up Traffic in 1974 and retire to session work for several years.<ref name="Mojo">Black, Johnny (May 1997).

===Other 1960s and 1970s work===

In 1986, Winwood travelled to New York City for his next album project. There, he enlisted the help of a coterie of stars to record ''[[Back in the High Life]]''. The album went triple platinum in the US, with its first single "[[Higher Love]]" reaching number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and earning Winwood [[Grammy Awards]] for Record of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.

Winwood has spoken very little publicly about the origin or meaning of the songs he has written. He has said that "when I write a song, I don't like to have to explain it afterwards. To me, it's like telling a joke, then having to explain it. The explanation doesn't add to the song at all."
