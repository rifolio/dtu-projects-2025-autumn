==Early life and family==
Dan Fogelberg was born in [[Peoria, Illinois]] on August 13, 1951. He was the youngest of three sons born to Margaret (née Irvine), (1920–2015), a classically trained pianist, and Lawrence Peter Fogelberg, (1911–1982), a band director at [[Woodruff High School (Peoria, Illinois)|Woodruff High School]] in Peoria, at [[Pekin Community High School (Illinois)|Pekin Community High School]] in [[Pekin, Illinois]],<ref name= Treehouse>{{Cite web  |url= http://www.treehouse.org/fogelberg/biography.html  |title= Biography |website= Treehouse.org  |publisher = Wynn Drumm |location= Waxahachie, Texas |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180718001530/http://www.treehouse.org/fogelberg/biography.html  |archive-date = July 18, 2018  |access-date= July 28, 2020 <!-- was June 6, 2010 --> }}</ref> and at [[Bradley University]] in Peoria.<ref name= songfacts>{{cite web|title= Leader Of The Band by Dan Fogelberg |website= SongFacts.com |url= https://www.songfacts.com/facts/dan-fogelberg/leader-of-the-band|access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref> Fogelberg's mother was a Scottish immigrant and his father was of [[Sweden|Swedish]] descent.<ref name="ref1">{{cite news|last= Lyons|first= Dee|title= Dan Fogelberg: Singer to Shine at Starfest|work= The Dallas Morning News|date= June 26, 1987|url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3CF439607F165&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|access-date= December 19, 2007|archive-date= March 19, 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070319172934/http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM|url-status= dead}}</ref>

Fogelberg often related his story of his father having allowed him to "conduct" the Bradley University school band at age 14. In 1981, Fogelberg released the song "[[Leader of the Band]]", which was written for and inspired by his father.<ref name= songfacts />

Using a [[Mel Bay]] course book, Fogelberg taught himself to play a Hawaiian [[slide guitar]] that his grandfather had given him. He also learned to play the piano. At age 14, he joined a band, The Clan, which covered [[The Beatles]]. His second band was another [[cover band]], The Coachmen, who, in 1967, released a single with both tracks written by Fogelberg, recorded at Golden Voice Recording studio in [[South Pekin, Illinois]], and released on the Ledger Record label: "Maybe Time Will Let Me Forget" and "Don't Want to Lose Her".<ref name= Treehouse /><ref name="RPM">{{cite web| url= https://www.danfogelberg.com/early-rpms |title=Early Recordings| first= |last= |website= danfogelberg.com| publisher=| date= |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>

After graduating from Woodruff High School in 1969, Fogelberg studied theater arts and painting at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. He began performing as a solo acoustic player at a coffeehouse, "The Red Herring", which is where he made his first solo recordings as part of a folk festival in 1971.<ref name="RPM" /> He was discovered by [[Irving Azoff]], who started his music management career promoting another Champaign-Urbana act, [[REO Speedwagon]]. Azoff sent Fogelberg to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to hone his skills. There he became a [[session musician]] and recorded his first album with producer [[Norbert Putnam]]. In 1972, Fogelberg released his debut album ''[[Home Free (Dan Fogelberg album)|Home Free]]'' to a lukewarm response, although it eventually reached platinum status.<ref name="DanFogelbergCom">{{cite web|title=Discography – Home Free|url=http://www.danfogelberg.com/infohomefree.html|website=danfogelberg.com|access-date=February 8, 2016|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054857/http://www.danfogelberg.com/infohomefree.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Career==
[[WZZQ (FM)|WZZQ]], a radio station in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], gave ''[[Home Free (Dan Fogelberg album)|Home Free]]'' a lot of airplay and some local promoters secured the City Auditorium in Jackson for a concert. They sold out the show in ten days and when they called Fogelberg's agent to let him know the show sold out, he was in disbelief because Fogelberg had been playing in clubs with less than 100 people in attendance, whereas the City Auditorium had 2,500 seats. On February 22, 1974, this show was broadcast and recorded by WZZQ and can be found on YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Watkins|first=Billy|title=Fogelberg tribute album stirs memories of when Jackson made him believe in himself|url=https://www.clarionledger.com/story/magnolia/2017/12/03/fogelberg-tribute-album-stirs-memories-when-jackson-made-him-believe-himself/912481001/|date=December 2, 2017|access-date=February 13, 2022|website=The Clarion-Ledger|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Dan Fogelberg, Jackson and WZZQ|url=https://www.radiodiscussions.com/threads/dan-fogelberg-jackson-and-wzzq.521234/|access-date=February 13, 2022|website=Radio Discussions|date=December 17, 2007 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Fogelberg's second effort was successful – the 1974 [[Joe Walsh]]-produced album ''[[Souvenirs (Dan Fogelberg album)|Souvenirs]]''. The song "Part of the Plan" became his first hit. Fogelberg also received contributions from the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] throughout the album. He had toured with the Eagles during this time. After ''Souvenirs'', he released a string of [[RIAA certification|gold]] and platinum albums, including ''[[Captured Angel]]'' (1975) and ''[[Nether Lands]]'' (1977).

His 1978 ''[[Twin Sons of Different Mothers]]'' was the first of two collaborations with [[jazz]] flutist [[Tim Weisberg]], which found commercial success with songs such as "The Power of Gold".<ref>{{YouTube|_8RPLbfY9&nbsp;km|''The Power of Gold'' video used in the ABC 1980 Olympics}}</ref>

''[[Phoenix (Dan Fogelberg album)|Phoenix]]'', from 1979, reached the top 10, with "[[Longer]]" becoming a #2 pop hit in 1980 and peaking at number 59 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] – his sole entry on that chart. This LP eventually sold two million copies.<ref name="DAN FOGELBERG"/> It was followed by a Top 20 hit "Heart Hotels". The album also reached number 42 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], likewise his only entry on that chart.

In 1980, Fogelberg appeared on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081696/soundtrack|title=Urban Cowboy (1980) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=September 8, 2019}}</ref> with his song "Times Like These". He performed live on television for the first time.<ref name="DAN FOGELBERG"/>

''[[The Innocent Age]]'', released in October 1981, was Fogelberg's critical and commercial peak. The double album included four of his biggest hits: "[[Same Old Lang Syne]]", "[[Hard to Say]]", "[[Leader of the Band]]", and "[[Run for the Roses (song)|Run for the Roses]]". He drew inspiration for ''The Innocent Age'' from [[Thomas Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Of Time and the River]]''. A 1982 [[Greatest Hits (Dan Fogelberg album)|greatest hits album]] contained two new songs, both of which were released as singles: "Missing You" and "[[Make Love Stay]]". In 1984, he released the album ''[[Windows and Walls]]'', containing the singles "The Language of Love" and "[[Believe in Me (Dan Fogelberg song)|Believe in Me]]".

Fogelberg released ''[[High Country Snows]]'' in 1985. Recorded in Nashville, it showcased his and some of the industry's best talent in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. [[Vince Gill]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Jerry Douglas]], [[David Grisman]], [[Chris Hillman]], and [[Herb Pedersen]] contributed to the record. In a world he defined as "life in the fast lane", Fogelberg described the music as "life in the off-ramp". In late 1985, he switched gears and took to the road with a group of musician friends, including [[Joe Vitale (musician)|Joe Vitale]], Paul Harris, Tino Gonzales, Jeff Grossberg and Rick Rosas, playing blues in small clubs throughout [[Colorado]] as Frankie and the Aliens, covering songs by [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Muddy Waters]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web

''[[The Wild Places (Dan Fogelberg album)|The Wild Places]]'', an album whose theme was the preservation of nature, was released in 1990 followed by a tour. His live ''Greetings From The West'' album, and full-length concert film (with interview segments) of the same name, were released in 1991.

''[[River of Souls]]'', released in 1993, was Fogelberg's last studio album for [[Sony Records]].

In May 2017, a live album of Fogelberg's performance at Carnegie Hall, championed by his wife,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.danfogelberg.com/live-at-carnegie-hall | title=Live at Carnegie Hall }}</ref> sourced from a 1979 tape made by his touring sound company, was released.
