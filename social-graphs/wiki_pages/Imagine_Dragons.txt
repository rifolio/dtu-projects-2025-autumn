Despite their popularity and large social media followings, reception towards Imagine Dragons from other musicians and music critics has been mixed since their breakthrough to the mainstream. Review aggregator [[Metacritic]] reports that the band's first four studio albums—''Night Visions'', ''Smoke + Mirrors'', ''Evolve'', and ''Origins''—have scores of 53, 60, 47, and 59, respectively, out of 100, indicating generally mixed reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Imagine Dragons |url=https://www.metacritic.com/person/imagine-dragons |access-date=2022-03-19 |website=Metacritic |language=en |archive-date=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710220109/https://www.metacritic.com/person/imagine-dragons |url-status=live }}</ref> The band's music has been criticized for its repetitive lyrics, "overblown" arena rock production, overemphasis on reverberation effects, sticking to formulas, and genre-hopping.<ref>{{Citation |title=Smoke + Mirrors - Imagine Dragons {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/smoke-mirrors-mw0002803699 |language=en |access-date=2022-03-19 |archive-date=March 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327212135/https://www.allmusic.com/album/smoke-mirrors-mw0002803699 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Imagine Dragons: Mercury – Act 1 |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/imagine-dragons-mercury-act-1/ |access-date=2022-03-19 |website=Pitchfork |language=en-US |archive-date=January 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220117062006/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/imagine-dragons-mercury-act-1/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Following the band's halftime show performance at the [[2019 College Football Playoff National Championship]], American music publication ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' ran an article titled 'Is Imagine Dragons The Worst Band Ever?', which described the band's songs as having lyrics that are "a composite of motivational platitudes and pseudo-dramatic yelps" which "barely merit repeating, if only because Reynolds seems so willing to do that himself" and featuring a "punishing, squelching rhythmic force".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-01-08 |title=Is Imagine Dragons the Worst Band Ever? |url=https://www.spin.com/2019/01/imagine-dragons-worst-band-halftime-show/ |access-date=2022-03-19 |website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|language=en-US |archive-date=March 19, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220319165536/https://www.spin.com/2019/01/imagine-dragons-worst-band-halftime-show/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The band has frequently been compared to Canadian rock band [[Nickelback]] by critics, referring to Nickelback's own negative public perception.

Despite this criticism, the band has described themselves as "genre-less". In an interview with ''Billboard'' at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]], Reynolds stated, "We've always kind of prided ourselves on being kind of a genre-less band. [...] I have no idea how I'd categorize us. Sometimes it's definitely pop; sometimes the songs are all guitar-driven.
