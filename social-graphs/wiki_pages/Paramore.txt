'''Paramore''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Franklin, Tennessee]], in 2004.  Since 2017, the band's lineup includes lead vocalist [[Hayley Williams]], lead guitarist [[Taylor York]], and drummer [[Zac Farro]]. Williams and Farro are founding members of the group, while York, a high school friend of the original lineup, joined in 2007. The band has had multiple lineup changes, with Williams being the only constant member.

The band was signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]], a subsidiary of [[Atlantic Records]]. Williams was signed to Atlantic separately, as she was [[Artists and repertoire|scouted]] when she was a teenager. They were the only label to let her stay in the band instead of going solo, but Atlantic said the rest of the band had to sign to Fueled by Ramen.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alex|last=Frank|url=https://www.thefader.com/2017/06/29/paramore-hayley-williams-cover-story-interview|title=Adult Emotions|work=[[The Fader]]|date=June 29, 2017|access-date=October 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629191802/https://www.thefader.com/2017/06/29/paramore-hayley-williams-cover-story-interview|archive-date=June 29, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The group's debut album, ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'' (2005), reached  number 30 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Chart]] in 2006 and number four on the [[UK Rock Chart]] in 2009.

The band's second album, ''[[Riot!]]'' (2007) became a mainstream success thanks to the success of the singles "[[Misery Business]]", "[[Crushcrushcrush]]", and "[[That's What You Get]]". The album was [[Certified platinum|certified Platinum]] in the US<!-- by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) --> and the band received a [[Best New Artist]] nomination at the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards|2008 Grammy Awards]].<ref name="Best New Artist1">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/awards/50th-annual-grammy-awards-nominations-1117977172/|title=50th annual Grammy Awards nominations|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 6, 2007|access-date=September 14, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230423021734/https://variety.com/2007/film/awards/50th-annual-grammy-awards-nominations-1117977172/|archive-date=April 23, 2023|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Best New Artist2">{{cite web|url=https://www.mtv.com/news/y2utwa/grammy-2008-winners-list|title=Grammy 2008 Winners List|work=[[MTV]]|date=February 10, 2008|access-date=December 28, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220829140942/https://www.mtv.com/news/y2utwa/grammy-2008-winners-list|archive-date=August 29, 2022|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their 2009 follow-up, ''[[Brand New Eyes]]'', reached number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<!-- with 175,000 first-week sales --> and became the band's second-highest-charting album to date.

The band's lineup changed once again after this album, with bassist [[Jeremy Davis]] leaving the band near the end of 2015 and former drummer Zac Farro rejoining the band in 2017. Their fifth and sixth studio albums, ''[[After Laughter]]'' and ''[[This Is Why]]'', were released in May 2017 and February 2023, respectively, to critical acclaim.

Williams was originally signed to Atlantic Records as a solo artist in 2003.<ref name="Grunge bio"/> She had been introduced to Atlantic A&R Tom Storms by Kent Marcus and Jim Zumwalt, lawyers of managers Dave Steunebrink and Richard Williams, and then eventually signed to Atlantic by [[Jason Flom]].<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html|title=Interview with Jeff Hanson|work=[[HitQuarters]]|date=September 20, 2010|access-date=October 7, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103105151/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html|archive-date=November 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Steunebrink and Richard Williams had originally discovered and signed her to a production deal that was later bought out by Atlantic.<ref name="hitquarters"/> The original plan of the label was to turn her into a pop singer, but Williams resisted, saying that she wanted to play alternative rock music with a band.<ref name="hitquarters"/> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]] the band's A&R at Atlantic, Steve Robertson, said, "She wanted to make sure that we didn't look at her as some straight to Top 40 pop princess. She wanted to make sure that she and her band got the chance to show what they can do as a rock band writing their own songs."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Steve_Robertson_Interview.html|title=Interview With Steve Robertson|work=[[HitQuarters]]|date=November 9, 2009|access-date=May 17, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416082717/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Steve_Robertson_Interview.html|archive-date=April 16, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Label president Julie Greenwald and the label staff decided to go with her wishes. The original management team for the band was Dave Steunebrink, [[Creed (band)|Creed]] manager [[Jeff Hanson (music executive)|Jeff Hanson]], and Hanson's assistant Mark Mercado.<ref name="hitquarters"/>

The band was officially formed by [[Josh Farro]] ([[lead guitar]]/[[backing vocals]]), [[Zac Farro]] ([[drums]]), Davis ([[bass guitar]]) and Williams ([[lead vocals]]) in 2004,<ref name="Grunge bio"/><ref name="AMG"/> with the later addition of Williams' neighbor Jason Bynum ([[rhythm guitar]]).<ref name="AP 08" /> When Davis showed up, he was stunned to find out the drummer was only fourteen years old. He admitted "I had very, very, very, little faith in everyone in the band because of their age. I remember thinking, 'This is not going to work because this kid is way too young,' but that first day of practice was amazing. I knew we were on to something."<ref name="Biography Today"/> According to Williams, the name "Paramore" came from the [[maiden name]] of the mother of one of their first bass players.<ref name="Ten Things About... Paramore"/> Once the group learned the meaning of the homophone [[wikt:paramour|''paramour'']] ('secret lover'), they decided to adopt the name, using the ''Paramore'' spelling.<ref name="Euro"/>

Paramore was originally supposed to release their music on Atlantic Records, but the label's marketing department decided it would be better for the image of the band to not have them attached to a major label. Instead, they released their music through the niche label [[Fueled by Ramen]].<ref name="hitquarters"/> [[Lyor Cohen]], the head of [[Warner Music Group]], had already identified Fueled by Ramen as a label they should partner with. It was decided the rock label would make an ideal match for Paramore.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> According to Robertson, when the band was presented to Fueled by Ramen's CEO John Janick, "he got the vision of the band immediately."<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> Janick went to a [[Taste of Chaos]] performance in [[Orlando, Florida]], to see the band perform live. In April 2005, after a smaller private performance at a warehouse, the band was signed to Atlantic Records and Fueled By Ramen.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/><ref name="Trades">{{cite interview|subject=Hayley Williams|subject2= Josh Farro|interviewer=Tony Pascarella|url=http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3440|title=Interview: Hayley Williams and Josh Farro of Paramore|date=August 8, 2005|access-date= August 16, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213011120/http://www.the-trades.com/article.php?id=3440|archive-date=February 13, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The band's first song written together was "Conspiracy", which was later used on their debut album. At this time, they were touring the Southeast, usually being driven by Williams' parents. She commented that "Back then, I guess we were all thinking, after school, we'll go to the house and practice. It was what we loved to do for fun, and still do! I don't think any of us really knew this would turn out to be what it's become."<ref name="Biography Today"/>

===2005–2006: ''All We Know Is Falling''===
{{Main|All We Know Is Falling}}

Paramore traveled back to Orlando, Florida,<ref name="altpress.com"/> but shortly after arriving, Jeremy Davis left the band, citing personal reasons. The remaining four members of Paramore continued with the album, writing "[[All We Know (Paramore song)|All We Know]]" about his departure, and later deciding to base ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'' around the concept. The album artwork also reflected Paramore's grief, as Hayley Williams explains, "The couch on the cover of ''All We Know is Falling'' with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space."<ref name="Trades"/>
