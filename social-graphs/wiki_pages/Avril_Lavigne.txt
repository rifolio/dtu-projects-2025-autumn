Lavigne's father and mother recognized their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang "[[Jesus Loves Me]]" on the way home from their [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church.{{r|sperling}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ryan |first=Patrick |title=Avril Lavigne opens up about Lyme disease battle: 'I wasn't sure I'd be doing music again' |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2019/02/14/avril-lavigne-lyme-disease-battle-comeback-album-head-above-water/2871284002/ |access-date=2025-07-25 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref> Lavigne has an older brother named Matthew and a younger sister named Michelle,{{r|peoplekappes}} both of whom teased her when she sang.

When Lavigne was 5, the family moved to Napanee (now incorporated as [[Greater Napanee]]),{{r|unofficialbiog}} a town with a population of approximately 5,000 at the time.{{r|canoemcqueen|mtvrealdeal|ewwillman}}

To support her musical interests, her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio. Her father often played bass at the church the family attended, the Third Day Worship Centre in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took her to karaoke sessions.{{r|msnbcpauley}}

Lavigne performed at [[Fair|country fairs]], singing songs by [[Garth Brooks]], [[the Chicks]], and [[Shania Twain]], and began writing her own songs. Her first song was called "Can't Stop Thinking About You", about a teenage infatuation, which she described as "cheesy cute".{{r|mirrorquigley}}

Lavigne also played [[ice hockey]] during high school and was named [[most valuable player]] (MVP) twice as a [[winger (ice hockey)|right winger]] in a boys' league.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zwerling |first1=Jared |title=Avril Lavigne recalls life as a hockey star |url=https://www.espn.com/blog/high-school/girl/post/_/id/1054/avril-lavigne-recalls-life-as-a-hockey-star |access-date=November 5, 2019 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=December 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925035808/https://www.espn.com/blog/high-school/girl/post/_/id/1054/avril-lavigne-recalls-life-as-a-hockey-star |archive-date=September 25, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Career==
===1999–2001: Career beginnings===
In 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with Canadian singer [[Shania Twain]] at the [[Corel Centre]] in [[Ottawa]], before an audience of 20,000 people.{{r|tracy}}{{r|unofficialbiog|canoemcqueen}} Twain and Lavigne sang Twain's song, "[[What Made You Say That]]",{{r|unofficialbiog}} and Lavigne told Twain that she aspired to be "a famous singer".{{r|canoemcqueen}} During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, "Touch the Sky", for his 1999 album, ''Quinte Spirit''. She later sang on "Temple of Life" and "Two Rivers" for his follow-up album, ''My Window to You'', in 2000.

In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing [[country music|country]] covers at a [[Chapters (bookstore)|Chapters]] bookstore in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]].{{r|unofficialbiog|canoemcqueen}} Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives.{{r|sk8terfaker}} Mark Jowett, co-founder of a Canadian management firm, [[Nettwerk]], received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement.{{r|patch}} Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with producer [[Peter Zizzo]] during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song "Why". Lavigne was noticed by [[Arista Records]] during a trip to New York.{{r|sk8terfaker}}

In November 2000,{{r|mtvrealdeal}} Ken Krongard, an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative, invited [[L.A. Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]], then head of Arista Records, to Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition "so impressed" Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25&nbsp;million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance.{{r|ewwillman|unofficialbiog}} By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater [[clique]], an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed [[skateboard]]ing, school left her feeling insecure. Having signed a record deal, and with support from her parents, she left school to focus on her music career.{{r|mtvrealdeal}}{{r|canadianpress|mirrorquigley}} Lavigne's band, which were mostly the members of [[Closet Monster (band)|Closet Monster]], was chosen by Nettwerk, as they wanted young performers who were up and coming from the [[Canadian punk rock]] scene who would fit with Lavigne's personality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Lavigne-Avril.html |title=Avril Lavigne Biography – life, family, children, parents, school, mother, young, old, information, born |access-date=January 4, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827104222/http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Lavigne-Avril.html |archive-date=August 27, 2016}} Most inexperienced singers are backed by seasoned musicians, but Nettwerk chose to go with young performers who were up and coming in the Canadian punk-rock scene. As Nettwerk manager Shauna Gold told Shanda Deziel of Maclean's, "[Lavigne] is young, her music's young, we needed a band that would fit well with who she is as a person."</ref>

===2002–2003: ''Let Go''===
[[File:AvrilShow cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Lavigne performing in 2002]]
Reid gave A&R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility of overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers, trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told [[HitQuarters]] that they initially struggled; although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, [[Curt Frasca]] and Peter Zizzo resulted in some good songs, they did not match her or her voice. It was only when Lavigne went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with [[The Matrix (production team)|the Matrix]] production team—including "[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]", later released as her debut single—that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. Lavigne worked further with the Matrix and also with singer-songwriter [[Clif Magness]].

}}On her debut album, ''Let Go'', Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as "[[Losing Grip]]", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as "[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]", saying that "the songs I did with [[The Matrix (production team)|the Matrix]]&nbsp;... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore."{{r|teenspirit}} Lavigne's second album, ''Under My Skin'', had deeper personal themes underlying each song, with Lavigne remarking that "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about&nbsp;... Like boys, like dating or relationships."{{r|musicomhinterview}} In contrast, her third album, ''The Best Damn Thing'', was not personal to her. "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through."{{r|scold}} Her objective in writing the album was simply to "make it fun".{{r|salva}} ''Goodbye Lullaby'', her fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records,{{r|musicmix}} with Lavigne describing the album as "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/lavigne-gets-deep-on-new-record-487574.html| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211021/https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/lavigne-gets-deep-on-new-record-487574.html| archive-date=October 21, 2021 | title=Lavigne gets deep on new record  | work=[[Irish Examiner]] | date=December 31, 2010}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

While Lavigne said she was not angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. She said, "I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me", adding that she had been writing "full-structured songs" since she was 14.{{r|ledgermoody}} Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for ''Let Go'', claimed they were the main songwriters of her singles "Complicated", "[[Sk8er Boi]]" and "[[I'm with You (Avril Lavigne song)|I'm with You]]". Lavigne said that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, stating that "[N]one of those songs aren't from me".{{r|teenspirit}}

In 2007, [[Chantal Kreviazuk]], who wrote with Lavigne on ''Under My Skin'', accused her of plagiarism and criticized her songwriting, saying that "Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/23/AR2007072300771.html |title=Singer-Songwriters, or Just Singers? |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=Nekesa |last=Mumbi Moody |date=July 23, 2007 |access-date=February 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219170734/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/23/AR2007072300771.html |archive-date=February 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{r|kreviazuk}} Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for "clear defamation" against her character.{{r|yahoomusic}} Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that "Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her."{{r|kreviazuk}} Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band [[the Rubinoos]], sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and [[Dr. Luke|Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald]] for allegedly stealing parts of "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" for her song "Girlfriend".{{r|billboardstole}} Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, "me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a [[Sum 41]] song. It's the [[Sex Pistols]], not the Rubinoos."{{r|yahoomusic}} In January 2008, a confidential settlement was reached between the parties.{{r|settle}}

===Influences===
Lavigne's earlier influences came from [[country music]] acts such as [[Garth Brooks]], [[the Chicks]], and [[Shania Twain]],{{r|teenspirit|mirrorquigley}} and [[alternative pop|alternative]] singer-songwriters such as [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Lisa Loeb]], [[Natalie Imbruglia]], and [[Janis Joplin]].{{r|musicomhinterview}} By the time she left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by [[skate punk]], [[pop punk]], and [[punk rock]] acts such as [[Blink-182]], [[the Offspring]], [[Sum 41]], [[NOFX]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Green Day]], [[the Ramones]], [[the Distillers]], and [[Hole (band)|Hole]]. She also enjoyed [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands such as [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] and [[System of a Down]], as well as [[alternative rock|alternative]] bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[No Doubt]], the [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[Radiohead]], [[the Cranberries]], [[Coldplay]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Matchbox Twenty]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Dashboard Confessional]] and [[the Used]].{{r|capricho.abril.com.br}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/avril_lavigne_when_females_lash_out.html |title=Avril Lavigne: When Females Lash Out |access-date=January 4, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307203139/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/avril_lavigne_when_females_lash_out.html |archive-date=March 7, 2016}} "what music she listens to then, she [Avril] said: "Marilyn Manson, The Used, Hole, Radiohead, The Distillers, NOFX etc"</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/avril-lavigne-20040624 |title=Q&A: Avril Lavigne |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 24, 2004 |access-date=January 4, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927071503/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/avril-lavigne-20040624 |archive-date=September 27, 2016}} "I've been listening to Third Eye Blind, Oasis, Marilyn Manson and System of a Down on my iPod, but I really like the new Blink-182 record.</ref>

Because of these influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's personal style, the media often defined her as [[punk subculture|punk]], something she said she was not. Lavigne's close friend and first guitarist, [[Evan Taubenfeld]], said: "It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest."{{r|ultimateguitar}} Lavigne commented on the matter: "I have been labelled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel&nbsp;... punk, and I am ''so'' not any of them."{{r|ledgermoody}} However, she has also said that her music has punk influences: "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough heavy pop-rock, which is what I really do."{{r|capricho.abril.com.br}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/interviews/a523465/avril-lavigne-interview-ill-always-be-young-at-heart/ |title=Avril Lavigne: 'I'll always feel young' |website=[[Digital Spy]] |date=October 14, 2013 |access-date=June 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613213415/http://www.digitalspy.com/music/interviews/a523465/avril-lavigne-interview-ill-always-be-young-at-heart/ |archive-date=June 13, 2016}} "For me, my music's always been heavy pop rock{{nbsp}}..."</ref>

When Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her [[tomboy]]ish style,{{r|vancouversun}} in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations.{{r|nytimesnecktie|wakeupvideo}} She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or [[Converse (shoe company)|Converses]],{{r|inked2010}} wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers.{{r|msnbcpauley}} During photo shoots, instead of wearing "glittery get-ups", she preferred wearing "old, crumpled T's".{{r|mtvrealdeal}} In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|pop punk princess]]"{{r|altman|observer}} and the female answer to [[Blink-182]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/girls/2011/01/the-11-hottest-comeback-chicks-of-2011/avril-lavigne |title=The 11 Hottest Comeback Chicks of 2011 |website=[[Complex Networks]] |access-date=January 17, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630083020/http://www.complex.com/girls/2011/01/the-11-hottest-comeback-chicks-of-2011/avril-lavigne |archive-date=June 30, 2014}} "Lavigne somehow devolved into that sk8r girl who was only relevant to the mid-2000s pop punk period as the female answer to Blink 182"</ref> Press and fans regarded her as the "anti-[[Britney Spears|Britney]]", in part because of her less commercial and "real" image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. "I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not."{{r|msnbcpauley}} By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was "wearing a costume".{{r|ewwillman}} Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career.{{r|manilamoody}}

Lavigne eventually took on a more [[goth subculture|gothic]] style as she began her second album, ''Under My Skin'', trading her skating outfits for black [[Ballet tutu|tutus]]{{r|observer}} and developing an image marked by [[angst]].{{r|mtvundermyskin}} During ''The Best Damn Thing'' years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits,{{r|imnotobsessed}} including "tight jeans and heels",{{r|inked2010}} and modelled for magazines such as ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''.{{r|vancouversun}} Lavigne defended her new style: "I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all&nbsp;... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on".{{r|imnotobsessed}}

Lavigne has been the subject of [[Avril Lavigne replacement conspiracy theory|a conspiracy theory]] that posits that she committed suicide in 2003 and was replaced by a body double who had previously been recruited to distract paparazzi.

==Other activities==
===Acting career===
Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video "Nobody's Home" involved the most "acting".{{r|girlauinterview}} Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'',{{r|sabrinateenagewitch}} performing "Sk8er Boi"{{r|mtvsabrinanov}} with her band in a nightclub.{{r|mtvsabrinaaug}} She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film ''[[Going the Distance (2004 film)|Going the Distance]]''. The main characters bump into her backstage at the [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]{{r|canoedistance}} after her performance of "Losing Grip".{{r|goingthedistance}}

She moved into feature film acting cautiously, deliberately choosing small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to [[New Mexico]]{{r|mtvflock}} to film a single scene in the 2007 film, ''[[The Flock (film)|The Flock]]''.{{r|digitalspyflock}} She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside [[Claire Danes]] and [[Richard Gere]]. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.{{r|digitalspyflock}} On her role in ''The Flock'', Lavigne said, "I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast."{{r|girlauinterview}} ''The Flock'' was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7&nbsp;million in the foreign box office.{{r|mojoflock}}

[[File:Avrilgfdl.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Lavigne at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Lavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film ''[[Over the Hedge]]'', based on the [[Over the Hedge|comic strip of the same name]]. She voiced the character Heather, a [[Virginia opossum]]. Lavigne found the recording process to be "easy" and "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so [director] [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim]] and [screenwriter] [[Karey Kirkpatrick|Karey]] had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. "[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude".{{r|girlauinterview}} The film opened on May 19, 2006, making $38&nbsp;million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojohedge}}

In December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'', based on the book ''[[Fast Food Nation]]: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal''.{{r|contactmusicfastfood}} The fictionalized adaptation, directed by [[Richard Linklater]], traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.{{r|washingtonpostfastfood}} Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.{{r|msnbcfastfood}}{{r|nytimesfastfood}} The film opened on November 17, 2006, and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojofastfood}}

Both ''Over the Hedge'' and ''Fast Food Nation'' opened at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]], which Lavigne attended. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the "right parts and the right movies." Lavigne was deliberate in the roles she had chosen, saying "I wanted to start off small and to learn. I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part."{{r|girlauinterview}} In August 2006, ''[[Canadian Business]]'' magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second annual Celebrity Power List ranking. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.{{r|canadianbusiness}} In September 2011, Lavigne appeared on the [[Hub Network]]'s televised singing competition ''[[Majors & Minors]]'' as a guest mentor alongside other singers, including [[Adam Lambert]] and [[Leona Lewis]].{{r|abbeyhuffington}}

In July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line ''Abbey Dawn'', featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by [[Kohl's]], which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.{{r|warechok|venaabbey}} Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a "juniors lifestyle brand",{{r|kohls}} which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. "I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all."{{r|usatodaybarker}} The designs were also featured on the Internet game ''[[Stardoll]]'', where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.{{r|nprmouse}}

Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada.{{r|basenotes}} When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, "I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colours are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are."{{r|seacrestinterview6may}} Black Star won the 2010 Best "Women's Scent Mass" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW).{{r|cewblackstar}} Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, ''Forbidden Rose'', which took two years to develop.{{r|2dayfm}} It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla.{{r|independentrose}} Its message is an extension of Black Star's "follow your dreams",{{r|perfumeblog}} though the tagline for the new perfume is "Dare to Discover".{{r|rosecommercial}} The commercial takes place in a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] garden setting,{{r|perfumeblog}} where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose.{{r|rosecommercial}} Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. The tagline for the fragrance is "Dare to discover more".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.basenotes.net/perfumenews/872-avril-lavigne-launches-wild-rose| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211021/http://www.basenotes.net/perfumenews/872-avril-lavigne-launches-wild-rose| archive-date=October 21, 2021 | title=Avril Lavigne launches Wild Rose | first=Grant | last=Osborne | work=[[Basenotes]] | date=September 28, 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crème brûlée.{{r|fragrantica}}

[[File:Avril Lavigne leaning, St. Petersburg (crop).jpg|thumb|Lavigne's XXV and star tattoos on her right forearm, and 30, lightning bolt, and star tattoos on her left wrist]]
As well as having some unique designs, most of Lavigne's tattoos match those of her friends.{{r|inked2010}} Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that was created at the same time as friend and musical associate [[Ben Moody]]'s identical tattoo.{{r|mtvaction}} In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter "D" applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley.{{r|inked2010|ferguson2007}} Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday.{{r|inked2010}} In April 2010, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist, that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.{{r|dose}}

Her love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and [[Brody Jenner]] each got matching tattoos of the word "[[fuck]]" on their ribs.{{r|radaronlinetattoo|usweeklytattoo}} Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for [[Inked (magazine)|''Inked'' magazine]], where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an "Abbey Dawn" on her left forearm and an "XXV" and star on her right.
