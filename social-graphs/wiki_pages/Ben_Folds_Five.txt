'''Ben Folds Five''' was an American [[alternative rock]] trio formed in 1993 in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]]. The group comprised [[Ben Folds]] (lead vocals, piano), [[Robert Sledge]] ([[bass guitar]], backing vocals) and [[Darren Jessee]] (drums, backing vocals). The group achieved success in the [[alternative pop|alternative]], [[indie music|indie]] and [[pop music]] scenes. Their single "[[Brick (song)|Brick]]" from the second album, ''[[Whatever and Ever Amen]]'' (1997), gained airplay on many mainstream radio stations. 

During their first seven years, the band released three studio records, a compilation of [[B-side]]s and outtakes, and eight singles. They also contributed to a number of soundtracks and compilations. Ben Folds Five disbanded in October 2000, but reunited in 2011, and released their fourth album, ''[[The Sound of the Life of the Mind]]'', in 2012, before disbanding again in 2013.

==History==
===1993–2000===
Ben Folds Five was formed in 1993 in Chapel Hill by Ben Folds. They were a trio in spite of their name, and the primary motivation behind the name, apart from the band's well-known use of humor, was simple preference, according to Ben: "I think it sounds better than Ben Folds Three."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dropd.com/issue/46/BenFoldsFive/ |title=Waist Deep in Pianos and Buses |access-date=September 2, 2006 |last=Hofmann |first=Pieter |date=March 10, 1997 |publisher=Drop-D Magazine }}</ref> Folds once described their music as "punk rock for sissies," a reaction to the angst prevalent in '90s rock.<ref>{{cite news|last = Thomas |first = Sarah |title = Ben Folds with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra |newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald |date = 2006-08-25 |url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/ben-folds-with-the-sydney-symphony/2006/08/25/1156012707758.html |access-date = 2006-09-23 }}</ref>

Their first radio single was "Underground" from their [[Ben Folds Five (album)|self-titled debut album]], released in 1995 on Caroline Records. The band's biggest success was the single "[[Brick (song)|Brick]]" from their second album, ''[[Whatever and Ever Amen]],'' released in 1997. It was followed by the more somber and jazz-based 1999 album, ''[[The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner]]''. The group contributed an outtake from the ''Reinhold Messner'' sessions, titled "Leather Jacket", to the 1999 benefit album, ''[[No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees]]''.

The band's final released recording was a cover of [[Steely Dan]]'s "Barrytown" for the ''[[Me, Myself & Irene]]'' soundtrack. The band had begun work on a fourth studio album, but following the worldwide tour in support of ''The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner'', the band "amicably" broke up in October 2000.  Tracks from the sessions later emerged in solo projects.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/Ben-with-the-breeze/2005/03/31/1111862476057.html|title=Ben with the Breeze|access-date=November 27, 2006|publisher=The Breeze | location=Melbourne | date=April 1, 2005}}</ref>

===After the break-up (2001–2011)===
Folds went on to pursue a successful solo career, releasing his debut album ''[[Rockin' the Suburbs]]'' in 2001, followed by ''[[Songs for Silverman]]'' in 2005, ''[[Way to Normal]]'' in 2008, and ''[[Lonely Avenue (album)|Lonely Avenue]]'' in collaboration with novelist [[Nick Hornby]] in 2010. He produced and arranged actor [[William Shatner]]'s second album ''[[Has Been]]'', co-writing the majority of the songs with Shatner. Folds also contributed songs to the soundtracks for the animated movies ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'' and ''[[Over the Hedge]]'', as well as forming the one-off side project [[The Bens]] (with [[Ben Lee]] and [[Ben Kweller]]) in 2003.

Jessee formed the indie band [[Hotel Lights]] in 2004, with his songs featured in television and film. Jessee released three studio albums for [[Bar/None Records]] in this time – including ''[[Hotel Lights (album)|Hotel Lights]]'' in 2006, ''[[Firecracker People]]'' in 2008, and ''Girl Graffiti'' in 2011.

Sledge played with International Orange until the group disbanded in 2005. He later became the bass player in the three-piece Chapel Hill band Surrender Human, with Matt McMichaels from the [[Mayflies USA]].

===Reunions (2008, 2011–2013, 2023)===
Ben Folds Five made a one-off concert appearance in September 2008 at the UNC Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill as part of the [[MySpace]] "Front to Back" series, in which artists play an entire album live. The band played its then-final album, ''[[The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner]]'', and were briefly joined on stage by Ben's father, Dean Folds, who read a transcript of his voice mail message that is used in the album song "Your Most Valuable Possession", encoring with some of the songs from their first two albums.<ref>[http://www.newsobserver.com/lifestyles/story/1224414.html "Ben Folds Five delights in reunion"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922031139/http://www.newsobserver.com/lifestyles/story/1224414.html |date=September 22, 2008 }}</ref>

In 2011, Ben Folds Five reunited to record three tracks for Ben Folds' ''[[The Best Imitation of Myself: A Retrospective]]''. They made their first live appearance in four years as one of the headliners of the 2012 [[Mountain Jam (festival)|Mountain Jam]] festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benfolds.com/news/catch-ben-folds-fives-first-reunion-performance-tomorrow |title=Catch Ben Folds Five's First Reunion Performance Tomorrow! &#124; The Official Ben Folds Site |publisher=Benfolds.com |date=June 1, 2012 |access-date=September 18, 2012}}</ref> They made further appearances at that year's 2012 [[Bonnaroo]] and [[Summerfest]] festivals.

The band's fourth studio album, ''[[The Sound of the Life of the Mind]]'' was released in September 2012, supported by the single ''Do It Anyway'', with a video featuring [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Rob Corddry]], and the cast of ''[[Fraggle Rock]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2012/09/exclusive-ben-folds-five-and-the-fraggles-sing-do-it-anyway/ |title=EXCLUSIVE!: Ben Folds Five and the Fraggles Sing "Do It Anyway" |access-date=September 17, 2012 |last=Folds |first=Ben |date=September 17, 2012 |publisher=Nerdist |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920071255/http://www.nerdist.com/2012/09/exclusive-ben-folds-five-and-the-fraggles-sing-do-it-anyway/ |archive-date=September 20, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A tour of the US, the UK, Australia and Ireland followed across the remainder of 2012.
