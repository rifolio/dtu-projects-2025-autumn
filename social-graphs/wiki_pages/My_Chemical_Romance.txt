'''My Chemical Romance'''{{efn|Often abbreviated as '''MCR'''}} is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[New Jersey]]. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]], lead guitarist [[Ray Toro]], rhythm guitarist [[Frank Iero]], and bassist [[Mikey Way]]. They are considered one of the most influential rock groups of the [[2000s in music|2000s]] and a major act in the [[emo]] and [[pop-punk]] genres, despite the band rejecting the former label.

Formed in September 2001 by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, and drummer Matt Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the band signed with [[Eyeball Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love]]'', in 2002. They signed with [[Reprise Records]] the next year and released their major-label debut, ''[[Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]]'', in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier was replaced by [[Bob Bryar]]. The album was a commercial success, attaining platinum status over a year later.

The success of the band's previous albums was eclipsed by that of their 2006 [[rock opera]] [[concept album]], ''[[The Black Parade]]''. A major commercial success, its lead single "[[Welcome to the Black Parade]]" topped the UK singles chart. The album solidified the band's following, despite negative coverage in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' generating controversy. The band's fourth studio album, ''[[Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys]]'', was released in 2010. Bryar departed the band prior to the release of the album, and in 2012, they added touring keyboardist [[James Dewees]]. In 2012 and 2013, the band released a series of singles they had recorded in 2009 under the collective title ''[[Conventional Weapons]]''. My Chemical Romance announced its breakup on March 22, 2013. They released a [[greatest hits album]], ''[[May Death Never Stop You]]'', in 2014.

The band announced their reunion in October 2019, with a reunion show taking place in December. They followed it up with announcements for other shows and a [[My Chemical Romance Reunion Tour|Reunion Tour]], which took place in 2022 and ended in early 2023. They released "[[The Foundations of Decay]]", their first new release in eight years, in May 2022.<!-- For upcoming tours, see 'Tours' section below. --><!-- Music style and legacy -->

On July 31 and August 1, 2009, My Chemical Romance played two "secret" shows at The Roxy Theater in Los Angeles. The shows were the first concerts the band had played since [[Madison Square Garden]] in May 2008. The band also premiered several new songs said to be from their upcoming fourth album during the shows, one reportedly titled "Death Before Disco", a song that Way said he was particularly excited about.<ref name="MCR plays at Roxy">{{cite web|first=James|last=Montgomery|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1617488/20090803/my_chemical_romance.jhtml|title=My Chemical Romance's New Album Is A 'Love Letter To Rock And Roll'|work=[[MTV]]|date=August 3, 2009|access-date=August 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804212819/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1617488/20090803/my_chemical_romance.jhtml|archive-date=August 4, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The song was since renamed "Party Poison" and was included on the new album. Way explained further in a ''Rolling Stone'' interview that "it's a completely different sound for the band&nbsp;— it's like an anti-party song that you can party to.

[[Gerard Way]] also said in a November 2009 interview with ''[[Rock Sound]]'' that the fourth album would be their defining work. "A friend who heard the record recently said he now had no interest in listening to our older work anymore, that we had made all our old material redundant. I took it as a compliment, the next thing you should always make the last thing seem unimportant and I think that will happen when we finally release this album."<ref name="Rock Sound">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/news/article/my-chemical-romance-talk-about-album-four|title=My Chemical Romance Talk About Album Four|magazine=[[Rock Sound]]|date=November 11, 2009|access-date=November 12, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113111042/http://www.rocksound.tv/news/article/my-chemical-romance-talk-about-album-four|archive-date=November 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> On March 3, 2010, Iero announced on their official website that Bob Bryar had left the band, writing:
