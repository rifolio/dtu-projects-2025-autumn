==History==
===Early years, ''Into the Half Moon'' (1999–2001)===
10 Years were initially formed in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] in 1999 with singer Mike Underdown, drummer Brian Vodinh, bassist Lewis Cosby, and guitarists Ryan Johnson and Matt Wantland. In 2001, Cosby left and the band recruited Andy Parks on bass. They independently recorded ''[[Into the Half Moon]]'' the same year.

===''Killing All That Holds You'', ''The Autumn Effect'' (2002–2006)===
Lead vocalist Mike Underdown left the band to pursue a career in acting and start up a new band, Courage, You Bastards, in Los Angeles, California. 10 Years soon recruited current vocalist Jesse Hasek from another local band named deficit. In 2002, Parks decided to leave the band and Cosby returned. The band then released their independent album ''[[Killing All That Holds You]]'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/artist/10-years/63569098 | title=Biography|website=[[iTunes]]| access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref>

10 Years were then signed to [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal Records]] in 2005 and released their major label debut, ''[[The Autumn Effect]]'' on August 16, 2005, with the songs "[[Wasteland (10 Years song)|Wasteland]]" and "[[Through the Iris]]" picking up regional radio play. Their first single, "Wasteland", spent over 12 months on the rock charts, finally reaching No.&nbsp;1 at [[active rock]] radio in December 2005.

That same summer, the band toured with [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] and [[Ill Niño]]. In the fall of 2005, they toured with [[Breaking Benjamin]] and [[Smile Empty Soul]], then followed up with the Masters of Horror tour with [[Mudvayne]] and [[Sevendust]].

They also toured with Korn and [[Deftones]] on the [[Family Values Tour]], which started in late July 2006.

In mid-February 2006, "Wasteland" reached No.&nbsp;1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs]] chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/431829/10-years/chart?f=377 |website=Billboard.com|title=Chart History |access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref>

===''Feeding the Wolves'' (2009–2011)===
10 Years announced that their upcoming and third major label album would be titled ''[[Feeding the Wolves (10 Years album)|Feeding the Wolves]]''.
