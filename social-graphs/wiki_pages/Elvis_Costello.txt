'''Declan Patrick MacManus''' (born 25 August 1954), known professionally as '''Elvis Costello''', is an English singer, songwriter, record producer, author and television host. According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Costello "reinvigorated the literate, lyrical traditions of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Van Morrison]] with the raw energy and sass that were principal ethics of [[Punk rock|punk]]", noting the "construction of his songs, which set densely layered wordplay in an ever-expanding repertoire of styles".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll |page=213}}</ref> He has won two [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Ivor Novello Award]]s, four [[Edison Award]]s, an [[MTV Video Music Award]], a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award, an [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] Founders award, and a [[Gemini Awards|Gemini]] award. In 2003, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 2016, he was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. 

Born into a musical family, Costello was raised with knowledge and appreciation of a wide range of musical styles and an insider's view of the music business. His opportunity to begin a professional career as a musician coincided with the rise of punk rock in England. The primitivism brought into fashion by punk led Costello to disguise his musical knowledge at the beginning of his career, but his stylistic range has come to encompass [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Country music|country]], [[jazz]], [[baroque pop]], [[Tin Pan Alley]] and [[classical music]]. His first album, ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (1977), produced no hit singles but contains some of his best-known songs, including the ballad "[[Alison (song)|Alison]]". Costello's next two albums, ''[[This Year's Model]]'' (1978) and ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]'' (1979), recorded with his backing band [[the Attractions]], helped define the [[New wave music|new wave]] genre. From late 1977 until early 1980, each of the eight singles he released reached the UK Top 30. His biggest hit single, "[[Oliver's Army]]" (1979), sold more than 500,000 copies in Britain. He has had more modest commercial success in the US, but has earned much critical praise. From 1977 until the early 2000s, Costello's albums regularly ranked high on the ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll, with ''This Year's Model'' and ''[[Imperial Bedroom]]'' (1982) voted the best album of their respective years.{{efn |Costello's albums have appeared at these ranks on the ''Village Voice'' Pazz & Jop critics' poll: ''My Aim Is True'' (1977), number 2;<ref>{{Cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=23 January 1978 |title=The 1977 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |work=Village Voice}}</ref> ''This Year's Model'' (1978), number 1;<ref>{{Cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=22 January 1979 |title=The 1979 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |work=Village Voice}}</ref> ''Armed Forces'' (1979), number 5;<ref>{{Cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=28 January 1980 |title=The 1977 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |work=Village Voice}}</ref> ''Get Happy!!''

Costello has released album-length collaborations with the classical ensemble the [[Brodsky Quartet]], the [[New Orleans R&B]] songwriter and producer [[Allen Toussaint]] and the hip-hop group [[the Roots]]. Costello has written more than a dozen songs with [[Paul McCartney]] and had a long-running songwriting partnership with [[Burt Bacharach]]. He has had hits with [[cover version|covers]] of songs, including [[Sam & Dave]]'s "[[I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down]]", [[Jerry Chesnut]]'s "[[Good Year for the Roses]]" and [[Charles Aznavour]]'s [[She (Charles Aznavour song)|"She"]]. One of the songs he is best known for, "[[(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding]]", was written by [[Nick Lowe]] and recorded by Lowe's group [[Brinsley Schwarz]] in 1974, but remained obscure until Costello released his version in 1979. Costello's own songs have been recorded by artists including [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[George Jones]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[Chet Baker]] and [[Alison Krauss]].

From 2008 to 2010, he hosted a television show, ''[[Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...]]'', on which he interviewed other musicians. In 2015, he published a well-received memoir, ''Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink''.

However, in ''Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink'', Costello writes that his maternal grandparents "were unusual for a Merseyside couple in not having any Irish, Scottish, or Welsh blood between them"{{sfn |Costello|2015|p=137}} and that his mother was raised Congregationalist.{{sfn |Costello|2015|p=537}}}}{{sfn |Costello|2015|p=137}}

=== Family background ===
Costello's mother, Lillian MacManus (nÃ©e Ablett, 1927â€“2021), was born and raised in [[Toxteth]], Liverpool, the daughter of a gas-main layer and a mother who became increasingly disabled by [[rheumatoid arthritis]] as Lillian grew up.{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=136â€“137}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Clayton-Lea |first=Tony |title=Elvis Costello: 'What you get is this face and this voice that has changed' |newspaper=The Irish Times |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/elvis-costello-what-you-get-is-this-face-and-this-voice-that-has-changed-1.4760262 |date=15 January 2022}}</ref> Responsible for caring for her younger brother and sick mother,<ref name="Chalmers2009" /> Lillian left school at 13 and took the first of a series of jobs at music stores.

=== Childhood and early musical influences ===

Costello spent most of his childhood in [[Twickenham]], in west London, before moving to Liverpool with his mother in 1970.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=22â€“23}} Costello was raised [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and served as an altar boy until he was 14.{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=537}}{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=20}}

Costello's parents had separated by the time Costello was ten years old, after which he was raised by his mother.<ref name="Chalmers2009" />{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=537}} Ross continued to be a significant presence in Costello's life and the two remained close until Ross's death in 2011.<ref name="Schruers1999" />{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=536}} Costello has said that a childhood spent watching his father work gave him an innate sense of how to be a musician but also an understanding that a career in music was a job like any other, requiring discipline and hard work.<ref name="Schruers1999" /><ref name="Rambali1983" />

Costello's parents never insisted he take music lessons or otherwise pushed him to follow in the family business. Instead, they raised him in a home filled with music, encouraged his musical curiosity, and supported his efforts to find his own way towards a career in music.<ref name="Schruers1999" /> Lillian told journalists that she knew before he was born he would have a career in music and that she listened to a broad range of music while she was pregnant with him with the intention of giving him an early start in music appreciation.<ref name="Chalmers2009" /><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Ouellette|first=Dan|date=November 2003|title=Northern exposure|magazine=Downbeat}}</ref>

As a young child, Costello's musical influences came from his parents' record collection, which encompassed a wide range of styles but centred on [[traditional pop]] and jazz.{{sfn|Kidel|2014|loc=at 7 minutes}} Ross's job with the Joe Loss Orchestra required him to sing many of the pop hits of the day for the band's weekly radio show. To learn these songs, Ross received demonstration copies of the original artists' records, which he brought home to rehearse.{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=40â€“42}} When Costello grew old enough to have an interest in the current pop hits, Ross began giving him five or six of these demonstration records per week. Costello has said, "That's why I know so many songs".{{sfn|Kidel|2014|loc=at 10 minutes}}

Chief among Costello's early favourites among the hit-makers of the day were [[the Beatles]]. He has said that, having turned nine years old in 1963, he was exactly the right age to experience the full force of Beatles fandom as he grew up.<ref name="Costello-2010">{{cite magazine|last=Costello|first=Elvis|date=2 December 2010|title=100 greatest artists:The Beatles|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/the-beatles-20110420|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref> He has described the Beatles as his biggest musical influence.<ref name="Doggett-1995">{{cite magazine |last=Doggett|first=Peter|date=September 1995 |title=Elvis Costello [interview] |magazine=Record Collector|location=United Kingdom }}</ref> Costello was also deeply impressed by the songs of his future collaborator [[Burt Bacharach]], which he knew through the hits British artists [[Cilla Black]] and [[Dusty Springfield]] had with them.{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=201â€“202, 504â€“505}}

As Costello grew into his teens, his favourites included British [[Beat music|beat]] groups [[the Kinks]], [[Small Faces]] and [[the Who]],<ref name="Doggett-1995" /><ref name="Marcus1982">{{cite magazine |last=Marcus |first=Greil |title=Elvis Costello explains himself |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/elvis-costello-repents-19820902 |magazine=Rolling Stone |location=New York |date=2 September 1982 |access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref> Jamaican [[rocksteady]] and [[reggae]] acts who were popular in Britain,<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Doggett |first=Peter |title=I stand accused |url=https://www.elviscostello.info/wiki/index.php/Mojo_Classic,_Vol._2,_No._5,_2008 |magazine=Mojo Classic |date=2008 |pages=Vol. 2, No. 5}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=White |first=Timothy |title=Give Thanks and Praises |url=http://www.elviscostello.info/wiki/index.php/The_Beat,_August_3,_1989 |magazine=The Beat |location=Glendale, CA |date=3 August 1989}}</ref> and especially [[Motown]] artists, whose work he knew mainly through their British hit singles and through the [[Motown Chartbusters]] compilation series.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=106}} By the time Costello reached his mid-teens, [[Joni Mitchell]] had become an important and enduring influence on him.<ref name="Costello-2004">{{cite magazine |last=Costello |first=Elvis |title=Joni's last waltz? |url=http://www.elviscostello.info/wiki/index.php/Vanity_Fair,_November_2004 |magazine=Vanity Fair |publisher=Conde Nast |date=November 2004}}</ref> When Costello moved to Liverpool, he found he did not enjoy much of the [[progressive rock]] that was popular with his peers, so, casting around for music he might like, he developed an interest in the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[folk rock]] groups like [[the Byrds]] and [[the Band]], and through them, [[country music]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Mahoney |first=Michael |title=Elvis Costello and the Sugarcanes |work=Dallas Observer |date=27 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="Graham-2018">{{cite news |last=Graham |first=Jane |date=7â€“13 May 2018 |title=Letter to my younger self |work=The Big Issue |url=https://www.bigissue.com/interviews/letter-to-my-younger-self/elvis-costello-i-knew-my-band-was-way-better-than-our-contemporaries/ |access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref>

=== Education and decision to pursue a career in music ===

Costello was a well-behaved if sometimes argumentative student, but not generally an academically outstanding one.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=14â€“15, 17â€“18, 29}}{{sfn|Kidel|2014|loc=at 11 minutes and 13 minutes}} Not having scored well enough on his [[eleven-plus]] exams to go on to [[Grammar school#In the Tripartite System|grammar school]],<ref name="Chalmers2009" /> he attended [[St Mark's Catholic School, Hounslow|Archbishop Myers]] [[secondary modern school]] in [[Hounslow]]<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mylondon.news/news/local-news/elvis-costellos-school-celebrates-anniversary-6001613|title=Elvis Costello's school celebrates anniversary|first=Robert|last=Cumber|date=20 January 2010|website=My London}}</ref> and then a [[comprehensive school]] in [[Everton, Liverpool]], for [[sixth form]].{{efn|Some sources incorrectly state that Costello attended the grammar school [[St Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool]]. He did not. He attended Campion Catholic High School in [[Everton, Liverpool]] a comprehensive school that had previously shared a campus with St Francis Xavier's College when the combined schools were known as St Francis Xavier Bi-Lateral School.{{sfn |Thomson|2004|p=23}}{{sfn |Costello|2015|pp=16â€“17}}}}{{sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=17â€“18, 23, 29}} Costello showed an early talent for writing. His mother told a journalist that, when Costello was 11 years old, his school entered him into a writing contest held by ''[[The Times]]'' intended for people aged 16 to 25, for which he won a prize.<ref name="Chalmers2009" /> As he finished secondary school, he earned one [[A-level]], in English, despite having made a firm decision to pursue a career in music a few months earlier and putting little effort into his final months of school.<ref name="Rambali1983">{{cite magazine |last=Rambali|first=Paul|date=August 1983 |title=Elvis Costello [interview] |magazine=The Face|location=London }}</ref>{{sfn |Costello|2015|pp=23â€“24}}

Although he never had any alternative career plan, Costello had previously been reluctant to commit to a career in music, partly because his upbringing had made him aware of the potential pitfalls involved. The shock of witnessing a teenage friend's death in a traffic accident changed his mind. He would later write, "Suddenly, everything but music seemed like a waste of precious time".{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=13â€“15, 23}}

Costello completed his formal education in 1972 and, still living at home with his mother, set out to find a job that would earn him a steady wage while he pursued a career in music.<ref name="Marcus1982" /> He soon took a job as a [[computer operator]] at the [[Midland Bank]] [[data centre]], in the [[Merseyside]] town of [[Bootle]], because, at Â£20 a week, it paid slightly better than other unskilled work he felt he was qualified for.{{efn| Britain had no national minimum wage in 1972, but Â£20 a week, when adjusted for inflation, is approximately equal to 75% of the 2023 national minimum wage for 18- to 20-year-olds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation|title=Inflation|website=Bank of England|access-date=23 July 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates|title=National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage rates|website=UK.gov|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref>}}<ref name="Rowland1989" />{{sfn |Costello|2015|p=142}} According to Costello, the job consisted of essentially manual labour such as mounting [[Magnetic tape data storage#Open reels|tape reels]] and loading [[punched card]]s.<ref name="Marcus1982" /> Because the job involved frequent periods of waiting for the [[mainframe computers]] to complete their tasks before beginning them on the next one, it gave Costello time to write songs while at work.<ref name="Marcus1982" /> Except for a few months in 1973 when he worked as a clerk at the Midland Bank [[Putney]] branch, he continued to work full-time as a computer operator until a few weeks before his first album was released in July 1977.{{sfn |Costello|2015|pp=142â€“143}}{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=91}}

== Music career ==
=== 1969â€“1976: Pre-professional career ===
Costello began writing songs and teaching himself to play guitar by age 14.<ref name="Doggett-1995" />{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=104}} To test his songs in front of an audience, he performed them in folk clubs that permitted amateur musicians to perform unpaid.<ref name="Marcus1982" /> He played these clubs regularly in London and continued in similar clubs when he moved to Liverpool at age 16, although folk music venues that welcomed original songs were scarcer in Liverpool than in London.<ref name="Colin1989">{{Cite magazine|last=Irwin|first=Colin|date=July 1989|title=Floor singer's revenge|magazine=Folk Roots|volume=73}}</ref> By 17, he was occasionally being paid a little money.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=125}} On the eve of the release of his debut album in 1977, Costello told a journalist that by that time he had written hundreds of songs.<ref name="Jones-1977">{{Cite magazine |last=Jones |first=Allan |date=25 June 1977 |title=The Elvis (Costello, that is) interview |magazine=Melody Maker}}</ref>

==== Rusty ====
At the beginning of 1972, Costello was invited to join a [[Folk rock|folk-rock]] band called Rusty by the band's founder, an 18-year-old veteran of the Liverpool music scene named Allan Mayes.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=25}} As other members left, Rusty soon became a duo, with Mayes and Costello singing and playing acoustic guitars.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=27}} For a little over a year, Rusty played regularly in small venues like pubs, clubs, schools, and community centres, mostly in and around Liverpool, unpaid or for small amounts of money.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=27â€“28}} In Mayes's estimation, Costello was already a talented songwriter, able to quickly write songs in a variety of styles, and could sing like [[Neil Young]] or [[Robbie Robertson]].{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=27}} Mayes has said he introduced Costello to [[Brinsley Schwarz]], a band that would be an important influence on him.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Mayes|first=Allan|date=October 1995|title=Brinsley Schwarz, Silver Pistol|magazine=Q|volume=109}}</ref> While in Rusty, Costello wrote an early version of a song he would record in 1980 as "Ghost Train", although by then little remained of the Rusty version except the central narrative idea of a married [[double act]] making their way through the low end of show business.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=125}} In 2022, Costello reunited with Mayes to record and release an EP called ''[[The Resurrection of Rust]]''. The EP contained songs that were typical of Rusty's shows in 1972, including the early version of "Ghost Train", then called "Maureen and Sam".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Greene |first=Andy |date=30 May 2022 |title=Elvis Costello Reunites With Teenage Bandmate for Nostalgic LP 'Rusty: The Resurrection of Rust' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/elvis-costello-reunites-bandmate-rusty-the-resurrection-of-rust-1359937/ |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>{{efn|Rusty's version of the song was co-written by Mayes and Costello, but by the time Costello recorded it as "Ghost Train", nothing remained of Mayes's contribution, so "Ghost Train" is credited to Costello alone.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=125}}}}

==== Declan Costello ====
By early 1973, Costello had determined that the music scene in Liverpool was too small to support his ambition to have a career in music, so he arranged to transfer from his job as a computer operator in the [[Midland Bank]] data centre in [[Bootle]] to a position as a clerk at the bank's [[Putney]] branch.<ref name="Colin1989" />{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=142}} Returning to London, Costello moved into the same [[Twickenham]] flat where he had lived with his mother a few years earlier, by then occupied by his father (Ross), Ross's second wife, and their infant son.{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=151â€“152}} When booking himself into London clubs, he began using the name Declan Costello, adopting a family name that Ross had once made a record under, because it was easier to spell and understand than MacManus when he spoke on the phone.{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=154 [illustration]; in deluxe ebook photo gallery, reproduction of "Folk Forum" from ''Melody Maker'', 14 April 1973}}<ref name="Rambali1983" /> Around this time, Costello accompanied Ross to Costello's first professional recording session, for the [[R. White's Lemonade|R. White's]] "Secret Lemonade Drinker" commercial jingle. Ross sang the lead vocal while Costello played guitar and sang backing vocals.{{efn|In a little-seen version of the television commercial, in which the lemonade drinker fantasises that he is a singer in a nightclub, Costello and his father mimed instruments as members of the singer's band.{{sfn |Costello|2015|pp=155â€“157}}}}{{sfn |Costello|2015|pp=155â€“157}}

==== Flip City ====
In the second half of 1973, Costello formed a band called Flip City with several slightly older men who, like him, were fans of [[Brinsley Schwarz]] and other [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] bands. The members of Flip City also shared Costello's enthusiasm for [[the Band]], the [[Grateful Dead]], and [[Clover (band)|Clover]].{{sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=38â€“39}} For most of 1974, Costello shared a rented house in southwest London with some of his bandmates.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=41}}{{sfn |Costello|2015|pp=163â€“164}} Flip City played the London pub rock circuit until the end of 1975, occasionally opening for more prominent bands such as [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]], but generally making little money and attracting little notice.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=42, 55, 57â€“58}}{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=174â€“175}} Flip City's performances consisted of a mix of Costello's original songs and covers of rock, R&B, and country songs. Their repertoire of Costello originals included early versions of songs that would appear on his first two albums as "Pay It Back", "Miracle Man", "Living in Paradise", and "Radio Radio".{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=44}} Costello wrote all but one of Flip City's original songs, did most of the singing, and chose the cover songs they played.{{sfn|St. Michael|1986|p=12}} A friend from those days later told a journalist, "It wasn't so much that he imposed the ideas; he was the one who ''had'' the ideas".{{sfn|St. Michael|1986|p=14}} None of the other members of Flip City shared Costello's commitment to pursuing a career in music and some disapproved of his desire to make money from his music.{{sfn|St. Michael|1986|p=12}}{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=56}}

Costello became engaged to marry a former schoolmate in late 1973.{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=152â€“153}} By then he had found a job as a computer operator at the [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.|Elizabeth Arden]] cosmetics factory in [[North Acton]], in northwest London, similar to the one he had in Bootle and with similarly low wages.{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=142â€“143, 180}}{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=41}} By early 1975, Costello was a husband and father and was struggling to support his family.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=49â€“50}}{{sfn |Costello|2015|pp=147, 180â€“181}} Flip City's live engagements added little to his income, rarely paying more than the band's expenses.{{sfn|St. Michael|1986|p=11}}{{sfn|Thomson |2004|pp=55, 56â€“57}}

Costello recorded demos with Flip City at several sessions from mid-1974 until mid-1975, hoping to use them to get live bookings, secure a recording contract, or sell Costello's songs for other artists to record.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=50â€“52}} All but the first of these sessions were at a small studio owned by [[Dave Robinson (music executive)|Dave Robinson]], future [[Stiff Records]] founder.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=50â€“51, 53â€“55}} Robinson later said that he thought Flip City "could not play at all" but Costello was talented and ought to "find a real band".{{sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=52, 55}}

After Costello became successful, Flip City's demos were widely bootlegged, often misleadingly labelled to imply they were outtakes from the ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' sessions or otherwise affiliated with Stiff Records.{{sfn|St. Michael|1986|p=28}} The only Flip City recording to have been officially released is Costello's song "Imagination (Is a Powerful Deceiver)", recorded in early 1975, which appeared as a bonus track on the 1993 and 2001 reissues of ''My Aim Is True''.<ref name="Costello-1993">{{Cite AV media notes |title=My Aim Is True liner notes |title-link=My Aim Is True |year=1993 |first=Elvis |last=Costello |type=inset |publisher=[[Rykodisc]]}}</ref> In the liner notes to the 2001 reissue, Costello wrote that, in retrospect, the song sounded to him like "a very early attempt to write a song like '[[Alison (song)|Alison]]{{'"}}.<ref name="Costello-2001">{{Cite AV media notes |title=My Aim Is True liner notes|title-link=My Aim Is True |year=2001 |first=Elvis |last=Costello |type=booklet |publisher=[[Rhino Records]]}}</ref>

==== D.P. Costello ====
Even before disbanding Flip City in late 1975, Costello was writing songs he did not include in the band's repertoire.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=46}} He recorded some of these as solo demos for Dave Robinson in mid-1975.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=224}} For the next year, he shopped these and other solo demos to music publishers and record companies, hoping to be hired either as a songwriter or a recording artist.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=183}}<ref name="Jones-1977" /> He sent out as many as 20 songs on a single tape to publishers, not yet realising that no publisher would have the patience to listen to so many songs.<ref name="Doggett-1995" /> Sometimes he went to publishers' offices to perform his songs in person.<ref name="Costello-2001" /> None of this generated anything but rejections until he began creating "show reels" of no more than six of what he believed were his most attention-getting songs, selected to appeal to the recipient of each demo tape.<ref name="Doggett-1995" />{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=183, in the photo gallery of deluxe ebook edition, "List of demos sent to record labels" and "Songs sent to ''Honky Tonk'', BBC Radio London"}}{{efn|Sources prior to 2015 state that Costello sent the six songs he sent to Charlie Gillett, often referred to as ''The Honky Tonk Demos'', to everyone he sent demos to during this period, including Stiff Records. However, in his 2015 memoir, ''Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink'', Costello states that his notebooks from this period indicate he was sending a different set of songs to each recipient. The deluxe ebook edition reproduces handwritten notebook pages illustrating this.{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=183, in the photo gallery of deluxe ebook edition, "List of demos sent to record labels" and "Songs sent to ''Honky Tonk'', BBC Radio London"}}}}

By February 1976, Costello was booking himself into clubs as a solo act under the name D.P. Costello, D.P. being his initials and a nickname he was sometimes called by his family.{{sfn|Gimarc|1994|p=24}}<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Norris|first=Chris|date=December 2008|title=[Elvis Costello] The Spin Interview|magazine=Spin}}</ref> While working as D.P.

Sometime in 1976, lack of money forced Costello, his wife and their toddler son to move in with relatives near [[Heathrow Airport]], on the far west side of London.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=184}} This meant Costello's commute to work in North Acton took him past the [[Hoover Building]] in [[Perivale]].{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=184}} Around the same time, he was starting to become aware of the nascent [[Punk rock|punk]] movement, although he would not hear any of the British punk bands until they began releasing records.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=185}}<ref name="Marcus1982" /> [[The Modern Lovers]]' song "[[Roadrunner (Jonathan Richman song)|Roadrunner]]", with its reference to such quotidian landmarks as the [[Stop & Shop]], inspired him to write a song about the historical [[Art Deco]] building he rode past every day.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=185}} Although he did not record it until 1980, Costello regarded this song, "Hoover Factory", as an artistic breakthrough.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=185}} In the period just prior, he had been trying to imitate songwriters [[Randy Newman]] and [[John Prine]].{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=181}} "Hoover Factory", he later recalled, got him "through the door to a different, less ingratiating way of speaking" in his songwriting.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=185}} The next song he wrote was "Radio Sweetheart",{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=185â€“186}} which would become the B-side of his first single.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=|pp=78}}

=== 1976â€“1977: ''My Aim Is True'' ===

In mid-August 1976, Costello included "Mystery Dance" and "Radio Sweetheart" on a demo tape he gave to [[Stiff Records]], a new independent label that had just released its first single.{{sfn|Balls|2014|p=|pp=36, 41, 78}}{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=226, in the photo gallery of deluxe ebook edition, "List of demos sent to record labels"}} Partly due to the airplay received from Gillett around the same time, Costello was soon evaluating offers from several record companies, including Gillett's own Oval Records.<ref name="Doggett-1995" />{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=67}} Costello chose to work with Stiff Records because they seemed prepared to move the fastest.<ref name="Doggett-1995" /> Stiff had been founded by [[Jake Riviera]], who managed several acts Costello admired, and Dave Robinson.{{sfn|Balls|2014|p=|pp=22â€“23, 28, 80}}<ref name="Doggett-1995" /> [[Nick Lowe]], whom Costello was on friendly terms with because he had attended so many performances by Lowe's band Brinsley Schwarz, was the label's first artist and soon became its in-house producer.{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=124, 224}}{{sfn|Balls|2014|p=36}}

Following a successful test-session in mid-September at [[Pathway Studios]], an inexpensive studio in [[North London]],{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=226-227}}{{sfn|Costello|2015|pp=183, 225, 226â€“227}} Stiff agreed to finance more sessions for Costello with [[Clover (band)|Clover]], an American [[Country rock|country-rock]] band from [[Marin County, California]],{{Sfn|Balls|2014|p=80}}{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=223}} as the backing band.{{sfn|Costello|2015|p=229}} Starting in late November or early December, Costello travelled to [[Headley Grange]] in [[East Hampshire]], where Clover were living, to spend the day rehearsing and working out arrangements for a batch of his songs and then recording the songs with the band the next day at Pathway.{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=231}} Costello still held a full-time office job,<ref name="Costello-2001" /> so the sessions were spaced over several weeks to accommodate his work schedule and Stiff's tight finances.<ref>{{Cite AV media|title=The First 10 Years Podcast Series|date=11 June 2007|last=Costello|first=Elvis|type=podcast|language=English|at=episode 1, at 5 minutes}}</ref> ''My Aim Is True'' was recorded and mixed in six four-hour sessions for a total cost of about Â£1,000.<ref name="Costello-2001" /> The final mix was completed in late January 1977.{{Sfn|Balls|2014|p=82}} Producer Nick Lowe, recording engineer Barry Farmer and Clover bassist John Ciambotti have all said they found Costello confident, well-prepared, and mature beyond his years during the making of the album.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=|pp=72, 74}}{{Sfn|Balls|2014|p=82}}

By February 1977, Riviera and Robinson, who were now Costello's managers, had given him his new stage name, Elvis.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=26 February 1977|title=Island gets Stiff in deal allowing dual sales plan|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> The reference to [[Elvis Presley]], who was still alive at the time, was simply intended to get attention.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=|pp=78-80}} Costello neither particularly liked nor disliked Presley.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Fewer 'mean songs' for Elvis Costello|last=Campbell|first=Mary|date=9 November 1986|work=Spartanburg Herald-Journal}}</ref> Because Costello had seen his father, Ross, work under a variety of stage names, he gave little thought to the name change.{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=|pp=206â€“207}} Riviera and Robinson also helped give Costello a distinctive appearance that contrasted with the contemporaneous ideas how pop stars looked;{{Sfn|St. Michael|1986|p=|pp=21â€“22}} they swapped the unobtrusive rimless glasses Costello had worn to correct astigmatism since he was a teenager for a pair with large black frames.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|p=80}}<ref name="Rambali1983" />

Costello's first single, "[[Less than Zero (Elvis Costello song)|Less than Zero]]", was released at the end of March 1977.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=|pp=78}} It received a few brief, mixed reviews in the British music press and sold very few copies.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=89}} Two further singles, "[[Alison (song)|Alison]]" and "[[(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes]]", also sold poorly; the former would become one of his best-regarded and best-known songs.{{Sfn|Balls|2014|p=|pp=84, 97}}{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=256}} Costello was receiving increasingly prominent, positive coverage in the British music press.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=|pp=88â€“89}}

''[[My Aim Is True]]'' had been completed since the end of January but its release was delayed, first because Stiff had wanted to release records by other artists who seemed more tied to transient music trends and then because of legal difficulties with Stiff's distributor, [[Island Records]].<ref name="Costello-2001" />{{Sfn|Balls|2014|p=84}} It was released on 22 July 1977.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=95}} Two weeks earlier, Costello had left his job as a computer operator at [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.|Elizabeth Arden]] on the condition that Stiff pay him, as an advance on future royalties, a regular stipend equal to the wages he had been earning at his job.<ref name="Costello-2001" />{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=91}}

=== 1977â€“1979: Peak pop stardom ===

In mid-June 1977, Costello held auditions for a bassist and keyboardist for a backing band for a tour to promote ''My Aim Is True'', wanting a sparser sound than on the album.<ref name="Jones-1977" /> [[Pete Thomas (drummer)|Pete Thomas]], formerly of pub-rock band [[Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers]], who were managed by Riviera, agreed to be drummer, although Thomas was then living in California and needed to be brought back to England.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=85}}{{Sfn|Balls|2014|p=|pp=22â€“23, 80}} [[Steve Goulding]] and [[Andrew Bodnar]], rhythm section of [[the Rumour]], also participated in these audition sessions, so that Costello could test how the musicians auditioning played as part of a band.{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=232}} Chosen were bassist [[Bruce Thomas (musician)|Bruce Thomas]] (no relation to Pete), who was 28 years old and had ten years' experience in professional bands, the most successful being the [[The Sutherland Brothers#The Sutherland Brothers and Quiver (1973â€“78)|Sutherland Brothers and Quiver]];{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=86}}{{Sfn|Balls|2014|p=89}} and keyboardist [[Steve Nieve]] (then Steve Nason), a 19-year-old student at the [[Royal College of Music]] who had formal musical training but no experience in any kind of pop group.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=87}} The band, soon named [[the Attractions]], would be Costello's touring and recording band for the next seven years.<ref name="Costello-2002">{{Cite AV media notes |title=This Years Model liner notes|title-link=This Year's Model|year=2002 |first=Elvis |last=Costello |type=booklet |publisher=[[Rhino Records]]}}</ref>{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=206, 208}}

==== "Watching the Detectives" and commercial breakthrough ====
Costello used the time with Goulding and Bodnar to arrange and rehearse "[[Watching the Detectives (song)|Watching the Detectives]]". He recorded the song with them at Pathway a few days later.{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=232}} Costello had written the song a few weeks earlier, partly inspired by [[the Clash]]'s newly released [[The Clash (album)|debut album]].{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=234}} Some of the musical ideas, which Nieve fleshed out when he overdubbed his piano and organ parts a few weeks later, were inspired by film scores [[Bernard Herrmann]] had done for [[Alfred Hitchcock]].{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=236}} Costello later called the recording of "Watching the Detectives" his first experience of "making records as opposed to recording some songs in a room".{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=234}} The song would be released as a non-album single in the UK and as a track on the US version of ''My Aim Is True''.{{Sfn|St. Michael|1986|p=30}}

''My Aim Is True'' received extensive, favourable coverage in the UK music press through a combination of effective [[publicity stunt]]s, such as Costello [[Street performance|busking]] in front of the London hotel hosting the [[CBS Records International|CBS Records]] business convention, and genuine enthusiasm for his music among music journalists.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=89, 94â€“96}} The album reached number 14 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] within a few weeks of its release.<ref name="officialcharts.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/16558/elvis-costello/|title=Elvis Costello, Albums, My Aim Is True [show Chart Facts]|website=Official Charts|access-date=4 August 2018}}</ref> "Watching the Detectives", released in mid-October, reached number 15 in the [[UK singles chart]], becoming Costello's first single to chart in any country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/16558/elvis-costello/|title=Elvis Costello, Singles, Watchin' the Detectives [show Chart Facts]|website=Official Charts|access-date=4 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="Costello-2001" /> This was the first of an unbroken streak of eight Costello singles to reach the UK top 30.<ref name="Costello-1993a">{{Cite AV media notes |title=This Years Model liner notes|title-link=This Year's Model|year=1993 |first=Elvis |last=Costello |type=inset |publisher=[[Rykodisc]]}}</ref> When Costello began touring the US in mid-November, he received prominent coverage in the US press, even though he played venues holding fewer than a thousand people.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=|pp=106â€“107}} By this time, Costello had signed to [[Columbia Records]], who released ''My Aim Is True'' in the US in early November.<ref name="riaa.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Elvis+Costello#search_section|title=RIAA Gold and Platinum [database search on Elvis Costello, show details]|website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|access-date=14 June 2018}}</ref> The album gradually climbed to number 32 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tape]] chart and was named among the best albums of the year by US music critics.<ref name="ECBillboard200">{{Cite magazine |date=19 August 2023 |title=Elvis Costello [show Billboard 200] |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/elvis-costello/chart-history/ |magazine=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres77.php |title=The 1977 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=23 January 1978 |access-date=4 August 2018 |last=Christgau |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Christgau}}</ref> In mid-December, Costello and the Attractions appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where they angered the show's producer by unexpectedly playing the then-unrecorded song "[[Radio Radio]]" during the live broadcast.<ref name="Houghton Mifflin Harcourt">{{cite book|title=Saturday Night Live: The First Twenty Years|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year=1994|pages=124â€“127|isbn=0-395-70895-8}}</ref>{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|pp=108-109}}

''This Year's Model'' was highly praised by critics in Britain and the US.

Released in early January 1979, ''Armed Forces'' debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, and spent 28 weeks on the chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/armed-forces//|title=Elvis Costello, Singles, Watchin' the Detectives [show Chart Facts]|website=Official Charts|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref> In the US, it spent 25 weeks on the ''Billboard'' chart, peaking at number 10 in mid-March.<ref name="ECBillboard200" /> The US release replaced "Sunday's Best" with Costello's cover of Lowe's "[[(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding]]".{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=|pp=132, 137}}{{Sfn|Hinton|1999|p=435|pp=}} Costello's best-selling single, "[[Oliver's Army]]", was released in Britain in February.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=136}} Costello has said he wrote the song after his first visit to [[Northern Ireland]] and was inspired by seeing young British soldiers on the streets of [[Belfast]] as a part of [[the Troubles]].{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=34-35}} The song reached number two on the UK singles chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/oliver's-army/|title=Elvis Costello, Singles, Oliver's Army [show Chart Facts]|website=Official Charts|access-date=9 February 2019}}</ref> It was also his biggest hit single in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], reaching number four on the Irish singles chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement|title=Search by Artist, [search on Elvis Costello]|website=The Irish Charts|access-date=9 February 2019}}</ref> The second single, "[[Accidents Will Happen]]", was released in early May.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=|pp=143, 145}} According to Costello, the song was written in response to his own marital infidelities.

The concert tour promoting ''Armed Forces'' was marked by bad publicity.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=131, 135, 139, 140, 142}} Costello and the Attractions played some shows that audiences considered too brief and refused to return for encores.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=131, 139}} Audiences in Sydney, Australia, and Berkeley, California, responded by vandalising the concert venues.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=131, 139}} After a concert in Columbus, Ohio, on 15 March, Costello got into a drunken argument at a hotel bar with members of the [[Stephen Stills]] band and entourage. The argument culminated in Costello disparaging [[James Brown]] and [[Ray Charles]] with racially charged insults, in comments he would later call "the exact opposite of my true feelings".<ref name="GHRhino">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Get Happy!! liner notes|title-link=Get Happy!!

In June, Costello had a hit as a songwriter when [[Dave Edmunds]] released his recording of "[[Girls Talk (Elvis Costello song)|Girls Talk]]", a song Costello had written but not yet recorded.{{Sfn|St. Michael|1986|p=54}} Edmunds' version reached number four on the UK singles chart and number 65 on ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/girls-talk/|title=Dave Edmunds, Singles, Girls talk [show Chart Facts]|website=Official Charts|access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |date=29 July 2023 |title=Dave Edmunds, Chart History, Hot 100 |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/dave-edmunds/chart-history |access-date=29 July 2023 |magazine=Billboard |archive-date=19 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210419054455/https://www.billboard.com/music/dave-edmunds/chart-history }}</ref>

===1980s===

Costello's 1980 [[Get Happy!! (Elvis Costello album)|''Get Happy!!'']] album featured a sound based on vintage American [[soul music]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Rick |title='King Horse' â€“ Elvis Costello & the Attractions |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/king-horse-mt0013639757 |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=19 June 2022 |archive-date=14 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220614211210/https://www.allmusic.com/song/king-horse-mt0013639757 |url-status=live}}</ref> Some songs marked a distinct change in mood from the angry, frustrated tone of his first three albums to a more upbeat, happy manner.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|loc=chap. 7}} The single, "[[I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down]]", was a rendition of a [[Sam and Dave]] song.{{sfn|Hinton|1999|loc=chap. 6}} Lyrically, the songs are full of Costello's signature wordplay. His only 1980 appearance in North America was at the [[Heatwave (festival)|Heatwave]] festival in August near Toronto.

In January 1981, Costello released [[Trust (Elvis Costello album)|''Trust'']] amidst growing tensions within the Attractions.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|loc=chap. 7}} The single "[[Watch Your Step (Elvis Costello song)|Watch Your Step]]" was released in the US only and played live on [[Tom Snyder]]'s ''Tomorrow'' show, and received airplay on FM rock radio.<ref name="Doggett">{{cite magazine |last=Doggett |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Doggett |title=Elvis Costello: The ''Record Collector'' Interview |magazine=[[Record Collector]] |date=September 1995 |issue=193 |pages=38â€“44}}</ref> In the UK, the single "[[Clubland (song)|Clubland]]" scraped the lower reaches of the UK singles chart; follow-up single "[[From a Whisper to a Scream (song)|From a Whisper to a Scream]]" (a duet with [[Glenn Tilbrook]] of [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]]) became the first Costello single in over four years to completely miss the chart.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|loc=chap. 7}}{{sfn|St. Michael|1986|pp=64â€“73}} Costello also co-produced Squeeze's 1981 album ''[[East Side Story (Squeeze album)|East Side Story]]'' (with [[Roger BÃ©chirian]]) and performed backing vocals on the group's hit "[[Tempted (Squeeze song)|Tempted]]".{{sfn|Thomson|2004|loc=chap. 7}}

October saw the release of ''[[Almost Blue]]'', a [[cover album]] of country music including songs written by [[Hank Williams]] ("Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do?)"), [[Merle Haggard]] ("Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down"), [[Gram Parsons]] ("How Much I Lied") and [[George Jones]] ("Brown to Blue").

''[[Imperial Bedroom]]'' (1982) featured lavish production by [[Geoff Emerick]], engineer of several [[The Beatles|Beatles]] records.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|loc=chap. 8}} It remains one of his most critically acclaimed records, but again it failed to produce any hit singlesâ€”"[[You Little Fool]]" and the critically acclaimed "[[Man Out of Time]]" both failed to reach the Top 40 in the UK.{{sfn|Clayton-Lea|1999|loc=chap. 5}}{{sfn|Hinton|1999|p=428}}{{sfn|Parkyn|1984|p=31}} Costello collaborated with [[Chris Difford]], also of Squeeze, to write the song "Boy With a Problem".

In 1983, he released ''[[Punch the Clock]]'', featuring female backing vocal duo ([[Afrodiziak]]) and a four-piece horn section ([[the TKO Horns]]), alongside the Attractions. [[Clive Langer]] (who co-produced with [[Alan Winstanley]]), provided Costello with a melody which eventually became "[[Shipbuilding (song)|Shipbuilding]]", which featured a trumpet solo by Baker. Prior to the release of Costello's own version, a version of the song was a minor UK hit for [[Soft Machine]] founder [[Robert Wyatt]].{{sfn|Thomson|2004|loc=chap. 8}}{{sfn|Clayton-Lea|1999|loc=chap. 5}}{{sfn|Hinton|1999|loc=chap. 9}}

Under the pseudonym The Imposter, Costello released "[[Pills and Soap]]", an attack on the changes in British society brought on by [[Thatcherism]], released to coincide with the run-up to the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 UK general election]].{{sfn|Thomson|2004|loc=chap. 8}}{{sfn|Hinton|1999|loc=chap. 9}}{{sfn|Clayton-Lea|1999|loc=chap. 5}} ''Punch the Clock'' also generated an international hit in the single "[[Everyday I Write the Book]]", aided by a music video featuring lookalikes of [[Charles III of the United Kingdom|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] undergoing domestic strife in a suburban home. The song became Costello's first [[Top 40]] hit single in the US.{{sfn|Thomson|2004|loc=chap. 8}}{{sfn|Hinton|1999|loc=chap. 9}}{{sfn|Clayton-Lea|1999|loc=chap. 5}} Also in the same year, Costello provided vocals on a version of the [[Madness (band)|Madness]] song "Tomorrow's Just Another Day" released as a [[B-side]].

Tensions within the band â€“ notably between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas â€“ were beginning to tell, and Costello announced his retirement and the break-up of the group shortly before they were to record ''[[Goodbye Cruel World (Elvis Costello album)|Goodbye Cruel World]]'' (1984).{{sfn|Thomson|2004|loc=chap. 9}}{{sfn|Clayton-Lea|1999|loc=chap. 6}} Costello later expressed disappointment with the final album's production, describing it as "probably the worst record that I could have made of a decent bunch of songs".<ref>{{cite AV media notes |last=Costello |first=Elvis |title=Goodbye Cruel World (reissue) |year=2004 |others=Elvis Costello and the Attractions |type=CD liner notes |publisher=[[Rhino Records]] |location=US |id=R2 76486}}</ref> The record was poorly received upon its initial release; the liner notes to the 1995 [[Rykodisc]] re-release, penned by Costello, begin with the words "Congratulations!

[[Daryl Hall]] provided backing vocals on the song "The Only Flame in Town" on ''Goodbye Cruel World''.

In 1985, Costello performed at the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], singing the Beatles' "[[All You Need Is Love]]" as a solo artist. He introduced the song as an "old northern English folk song", and the audience was invited to sing the chorus. In the same year Costello teamed up with friend [[T&nbsp;Bone Burnett]] for the single "The People's Limousine" under the moniker of the Coward Brothers. That year, Costello also produced ''[[Rum Sodomy & the Lash]]'' for the Irish punk/folk band [[the Pogues]] and he sang with [[Annie Lennox]] on the song "Adrian" from the [[Eurythmics]] record ''[[Be Yourself Tonight]]''.

Growing antipathy between Costello and Bruce Thomas contributed to the Attractions' first split in 1986 when Costello was preparing to make a comeback. Working in the US with Burnett, a band containing a number of [[Elvis Presley]]'s sidemen (including [[James Burton]] and [[Jerry Scheff]]), and minor input from the Attractions, he produced ''[[King of America]]'', an acoustic guitar-driven album with a country sound. It was billed as performed by "The Costello Show featuring the Attractions and Confederates" in the UK and Europe and "The Costello Show featuring Elvis Costello" in North America. Around this time he legally changed his name back to Declan MacManus, adding Aloysius as an extra middle name.<ref name="Levin"/> Costello retooled his upcoming tour to allow for multiple nights in each city, playing one night with the Confederates, one night with the Attractions, and one night solo acoustic. In May 1986, he performed at [[Self Aid]], a benefit concert held in [[Dublin]] that focused on the chronic unemployment which was widespread in Ireland at that time.

Later that year, Costello returned to the studio with the Attractions and recorded ''[[Blood & Chocolate]]'', which was lauded for a [[post-punk]] fervour not heard since 1978's ''This Year's Model''. It also marked the return of producer [[Nick Lowe]], who had produced Costello's first five albums. While ''Blood & Chocolate'' failed to chart a hit single of any significance, it did produce what has since become one of Costello's signature concert songs, "[[I Want You (Elvis Costello song)|I Want You]]". On this album, Costello adopted the alias Napoleon Dynamite, the name he later attributed to the character of the [[emcee]] that he played during the [[vaudeville]]-style tour to support ''Blood & Chocolate''. (The pseudonym had previously been used in 1982, when the B-side single "Imperial Bedroom" was credited to Napoleon Dynamite & the Royal Guard; whether the title of the 2004 film ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' was inspired by Costello is disputed). After the tour for ''Blood & Chocolate'', Costello split from the Attractions, due mostly to lingering tensions between him and Bruce Thomas. Costello continued to work with another Attraction, Pete Thomas, as a session musician for future releases.

Costello's recording contract with Columbia Records ended after ''Blood & Chocolate''. In 1987, he released a compilation album, ''[[Out of Our Idiot]]'', on his UK label, [[Demon Records]] consisting of B-sides, side projects, and unreleased songs from recording sessions from 1980 to 1987. He signed a new contract with [[Warner Bros.]] and in early 1989 released ''[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Spike]]'', which spawned his biggest single in the US, the Top 20 hit (it reached number 19) "[[Veronica (song)|Veronica]]",<ref name=bbchart>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=elvis costello|chart=all}} "Veronica" â€“ Elvis Costello â€“ Chart History] Billboard.com; Retrieved 14 August 2023</ref> one of several songs Costello co-wrote with [[Paul McCartney]].

Costello and McCartney wrote several songs together over a short period, which were released over a number of years:
* "Back On My Feet", the B-side of McCartney's 1987 single "[[Once Upon a Long Ago]]", later added as a bonus track on the 1993 re-issue of McCartney's ''[[Flowers in the Dirt]]''
* Costello's "[[Veronica (song)|Veronica]]" and "Pads, Paws and Claws" from his album [[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|''Spike'']] (1989)
* McCartney's "[[My Brave Face]]", "Don't Be Careless Love", "That Day Is Done" and the McCartney/Costello duet "You Want Her Too", all from McCartney's ''Flowers in the Dirt'' (1989)
* "So Like Candy" and "Playboy to a Man" from Costello's ''[[Mighty Like a Rose]]'' (1991)
* "The Lovers That Never Were" and "Mistress and Maid" from McCartney's ''[[Off the Ground]]'' (1993).
* "Shallow Grave" from Costello's ''[[All This Useless Beauty]]'' (1996).
* Costello has also issued solo demo recordings of "Veronica", "Pads, Paws and Claws" and "Mistress and Maid" (a song he did not otherwise record). Two other McCartney/Costello compositions remained officially unissued, while existing as widely bootlegged demos ("Tommy's Coming Home" and "Twenty Fine Fingers"). These two tracks, along with demos of other songs from their collaboration, did eventually see release on the Paul McCartney Archive edition of ''Flowers in the Dirt''.

In 1987, Costello appeared on the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] special ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]'', a tribute to his long-time idol [[Roy Orbison]].{{Cn|date=September 2024}} Costello co-wrote "[[The Other End (Of the Telescope)]]" with the American singer-songwriter [[Aimee Mann]].

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, Costello released ''[[Mighty Like a Rose]]'', which featured the single "[[The Other Side of Summer]]". He also co-composed and co-produced, with [[Richard Harvey (composer)|Richard Harvey]], the [[G.B.H. (soundtrack)|title and incidental music for the mini-series]] ''[[G.B.H. (TV series)|G.B.H.]]'' by [[Alan Bleasdale]]. This entirely instrumental, and largely orchestral, soundtrack garnered a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], for Best Music for a TV Series for the pair.

In 1993, Costello experimented with classical music with a critically acclaimed collaboration with the [[Brodsky Quartet]]<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Juliet Letters (review) |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |date=18 March 1993 |magazine=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-juliet-letters-19930318 |access-date=27 August 2017 |archive-date=30 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830045333/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-juliet-letters-19930318 |url-status=live}}</ref> on ''[[The Juliet Letters]]''. During this period, he wrote a full album's worth of material for [[Wendy James]], and these songs became the tracks on her 1993 solo album ''Now Ain't the Time for Your Tears''. Costello returned to rock and roll the following year with a project that reunited him with the Attractions, ''[[Brutal Youth]]''. In 1995, he released ''[[Kojak Variety]]'', an album of cover songs recorded five years earlier, and followed in 1996 with an album of songs originally written for other artists, ''[[All This Useless Beauty]]''. This was the final album of original material that he issued under his Warner Bros. contract, and also his final album with the Attractions.

In 1994, he sang "[[They Can't Take That Away from Me]]" with [[Tony Bennett]] for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', appearing on [[MTV Unplugged (Tony Bennett album)|the album released from the broadcast]].

In the spring of 1996, Costello played a series of intimate club dates, backed only by Steve Nieve on the piano, in support of ''All This Useless Beauty''. An ensuing mid-year tour with the Attractions proved to be the death knell, with relations between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas at a breaking point, Costello announced that the current tour would be the Attractions' last. The quartet performed their final US show in [[Seattle]], Washington on 1 September 1996, before wrapping up their tour in Japan. Costello continued to work frequently with Attractions Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas; eventually, both became members of Costello's new back-up band, The Imposters.

To fulfill his contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Costello released a greatest hits album titled ''[[Extreme Honey]]'' (1997). It contained an original track titled "The Bridge I Burned", featuring Costello's son, Matt, on bass. In the intervening period, Costello had served as artistic chair for the 1995 [[Meltdown Festival]], which gave him the opportunity to explore his increasingly eclectic musical interests. His involvement in the festival yielded a one-off live [[Extended play|EP]] with jazz guitarist [[Bill Frisell]], which featured both cover material and a few of his own songs.

In 1998, Costello signed a multi-label contract with [[Polygram Records]], sold by its parent company the same year to become part of the [[Universal Music Group]]. Costello released his new work on what he deemed the suitable imprimatur within the family of labels. His first new release as part of this contract involved a collaboration with [[Burt Bacharach]]. Their work had commenced earlier, in 1996, on "God Give Me Strength" for the movie ''[[Grace of My Heart]]''. This led the pair to write and record the critically acclaimed album ''[[Painted From Memory]]'',<ref>{{cite news |last=McEvoy |first=Colin |title=What It Was Like to Work with Burt Bacharach, in the Words of his Collaborators |work=[[Biography (TV program)|Biography]] |date=9 February 2023 |url=https://www.biography.com/musicians/a42815918/burt-bacharach-famous-collaborators |access-date=11 February 2023}}</ref> released under his new contract in 1998, on the [[Mercury Records]] label, featuring songs that were largely inspired by the dissolution of his relationship with [[Cait O'Riordan]]. Costello and Bacharach performed several concerts with full orchestral backing, and also recorded an updated version of Bacharach's "[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]" for the soundtrack to ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'', with both appearing in the film to perform the song. He also wrote "I Throw My Toys Around" for ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'' and performed it with [[No Doubt]]. The same year, he collaborated with [[Paddy Moloney]] of [[the Chieftains]] on "The Long Journey Home" on the soundtrack of the [[PBS]]/[[Disney]] ''[[The Irish in America: Long Journey Home]]'' miniseries. The soundtrack won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=1999 Grammy Awards |magazine=Billboard |date=6 March 1999}}</ref>

In 1999, Costello contributed a version of "[[She (Charles Aznavour)|She]]", released in 1974 by [[Charles Aznavour]] and [[Herbert Kretzmer]], for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'', with [[Trevor Jones (composer)|Trevor Jones]] producing.

From 2001 to 2005, Costello re-issued his back catalogue in the US, from ''My Aim Is True'' (1977) to ''All This Useless Beauty'' (1996), on double-disc collections on the [[Rhino Records]] label. These releases, which each contained second discs of bonus material, ultimately fell out of print by 2007 after Universal Music acquired the rights to Costello's catalogue. Universal subsequently released new deluxe editions of ''My Aim Is True'' and ''This Year's Model'' with new bonus material of full-length concerts from the time of each album's release. These deluxe editions also fell out of print and Universal has reverted to re-releasing Costello's pre-1987 albums in their original context without bonus material.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

In 2000, Costello wrote lyrics to "Green Song", a solo cello piece by [[Svante Henryson]]; this song appears on the Anne Sofie von Otter album ''[[For the Stars]]''.

In 2000, Costello appeared at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|the Town Hall]], New York, in Steve Nieve's opera ''[[Welcome to the Voice]]'', alongside [[Ron Sexsmith]] and [[John Flansburgh]] of [[They Might Be Giants]]. In 2001, Costello was artist-in-residence at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and wrote the music for a new ballet. He produced and appeared on an album of pop songs for the classical singer [[Anne Sofie von Otter]]. He released the album ''[[When I Was Cruel]]'' in 2002 on [[Island Records]], and toured with a new band, the Imposters (essentially the Attractions but with a different bass player, [[Davey Faragher]], formerly of [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]]).

On 23 February 2003, Costello, along with [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Steven Van Zandt]] and [[Dave Grohl]], performed a version of [[the Clash]]'s "[[London Calling (song)|London Calling]]" at the 45th Grammy Awards ceremony, in honour of Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]], who had died the previous December.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/17-bruce-springsteen-collaborations-from-chuck-berry-to-lada-gaga-20110124/london-calling-with-dave-grohl-and-elvis-costello-0751054 |title=Great Bruce Springsteen Collaborations: 'London Calling' With Dave Grohl and Elvis Costello |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=27 September 2015 |archive-date=29 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929054412/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/17-bruce-springsteen-collaborations-from-chuck-berry-to-lada-gaga-20110124/london-calling-with-dave-grohl-and-elvis-costello-0751054 |url-status=live}}</ref> In March, Elvis Costello & the Attractions were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="RaRHoF" /> In May, he announced his engagement to Canadian [[jazz]] singer and pianist [[Diana Krall]], whom he had seen in concert and then met backstage at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in Australia. That September, he released [[North (Elvis Costello album)|''North'']], an album of piano-based ballads concerning the breakdown of his former marriage, and his falling in love with Krall.

The song "Scarlet Tide" (co-written by Costello and [[T Bone Burnett]] and used in the film ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'') was nominated for a [[Academy Awards|2004 Academy Award]]; he performed it at the awards ceremony with [[Alison Krauss]], who sang the song on the official soundtrack. Costello co-wrote many songs on Krall's 2004 CD, ''[[The Girl in the Other Room]]'', the first of hers to feature several original compositions. In July 2004, Costello's first full-scale orchestral work, ''[[Il Sogno]]'', was performed in New York. The work, a ballet based on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', was commissioned by Italian dance troupe Aterballeto, and received critical acclaim from classical music critics. Performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Michael Tilson Thomas]], the recording was released on CD in September by [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. In September 2004, Costello released the album ''[[The Delivery Man (album)|The Delivery Man]]'', recorded in [[Oxford, Mississippi]], on [[Lost Highway Records]], and it was hailed as one of his best.

A CD recording of a collaboration with [[Marian McPartland]] on her show ''[[Piano Jazz]]'' was released in 2005. It featured Costello singing six jazz standards and two of his own songs, accompanied by McPartland on piano.

A 2005 tour included a gig at [[Glastonbury]] that Costello considered so dreadful that he said "I don't care if I ever play England again. That gig made up my mind I wouldn't come back. I don't get along with it. We lost touch. It's 25 years since I lived there. I don't dig it, they don't dig me....British music fans don't have the same attitude to age as they do in America, where young people come to check out, say [[Willie Nelson]]. They feel some connection with him and find a role for that music in their lives".<ref name="indep07">{{cite news |title=Goodbye, cruel UK: Elvis Costello turns his back on his native land |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=8 November 2007 |first=Amol |last=Rajan |access-date=6 November 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/goodbye-cruel-uk-elvis-costello-turns-his-back-on-his-native-land-399429.html |archive-date=9 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109191656/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/goodbye-cruel-uk-elvis-costello-turns-his-back-on-his-native-land-399429.html }}</ref>

In a studio recording of Nieve's opera ''Welcome to the Voice'' (2006, Deutsche Grammophon), Costello interpreted the character of Chief of Police, with [[Barbara Bonney]], Robert Wyatt, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Amanda Roocroft]], and the album reached No.&nbsp;2 in the ''Billboard'' classical charts. Costello later reprised the piece on the stage of the [[ThÃ©Ã¢tre du ChÃ¢telet]] in Paris in 2008, with Sting, [[Joe Sumner]] (Sting's son) and Sylvia Schwartz.

== Public image and controversies ==

Costello revealed little about his background and gave few interviews in the first five years of his career, so the few widely published interviews he gave played a large role in forming his early public image.<ref name="Paumgartner" /> In a widely quoted August 1977 interview with [[Nick Kent]], Costello said the only things that mattered to him were "revenge and guilt".<ref name="Marcus1982" /><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Kent |first=Nick |date=27 August 1977 |title=D.

=== 1977 ''Saturday Night Live'' appearance ===

On 17 December 1977, Costello and the Attractions appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as last-minute replacements for the [[Sex Pistols]].<ref name="Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"/>{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=108-109}} One of the songs Costello was scheduled to perform, at the request of his record company, was "[[Less than Zero (Elvis Costello song)|Less Than Zero]]", a song Costello wrote in reaction to seeing British fascist [[Oswald Mosley]] being treated with what Costello felt was undeserved deference during an interview on British television.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=108-109}}<ref name="Marcus1982" /> Costello did not want to play the song because he thought the subject was too obscure for American audiences and the song was too low-key to make a strong impression.<ref name="Costello-2001" />{{Sfn|Costello|2015|p=307}} Instead, he wanted to play the then-unrecorded song, "Radio Radio". During the live broadcast, Costello played a few bars of "Less Than Zero" and then told the Attractions to play "Radio Radio", which they played in its entirety.{{Sfn|Thomson|2004|p=109}} This angered the show's producer, [[Lorne Michaels]], because Michaels was not prepared for the change and because "Radio Radio" had not been cleared by [[NBC]]'s censors.<ref name="Guccione">{{Cite magazine|last=Guccione|first=Bob Jr|date=February 1993|title=Lorne Michaels [interview]|magazine=Spin}}</ref><ref name="Untreed Reads">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkUn4S_OlngC|title=Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live|last1=Hill|first1=Doug|last2=Weingrad|first2=Jeff|publisher=Untreed Reads|year=2011|isbn=978-1-61187-218-7|chapter=15: You Can't give Noogies to the Virgin Mary|orig-date=1986}}</ref>{{efn|Many sources assert without evidence that Lorne Michaels or others associated with ''Saturday Night Live'', rather than Costello's record company, had told Costello not to play "Radio Radio", or that the supposedly anti-corporate nature of the song's lyrics was the reason he was told not to play it, or both.

=== 1979 Columbus incident ===
In March 1979, during a drunken argument with [[Bonnie Bramlett]] and other members of the [[Stephen Stills]] band, at a [[Holiday Inn]] bar in [[Columbus, Ohio]], Costello referred to [[Ray Charles]] as a "blind, ignorant [[nigger]]" and made similar comments about [[James Brown]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Greil |last=Marcus |title=In The Fascist Bathroom |year=1993 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=0-14-014940-6 |page=229}}</ref> At a New York City press conference a few days later, Costello said he had been drunk and had been attempting to be obnoxious to bring the conversation to a swift conclusion, not anticipating that Bramlett would bring his comments to the press. According to Costello, "It became necessary for me to outrage these people with about the most obnoxious and offensive remarks that I could muster".

In his liner notes for the expanded version of ''[[Get Happy!! (Elvis Costello album)|Get Happy!!]]'' Costello writes that some time after the incident he had declined an offer to meet Charles out of guilt and embarrassment, although Charles himself had forgiven Costello, saying "Drunken talk isn't meant to be printed in the paper". Costello worked extensively in Britain's [[Rock Against Racism]] campaign both before and after the incident. In an interview with [[Questlove]] (drummer for [[the Roots]], with whom Costello collaborated in 2013), he stated: "It's upsetting because I can't explain how I even got to think you could be funny about something like that" and further elaborating with, "I'm sorry. You know? It's about time I said it out loud."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Courtney E. |title=Elvis Costello Opens Up About 1979 Racial Slurs in Interview With ?uestlove |url=http://radio.com/2013/10/17/elvis-costello-opens-up-about-1979-racial-slurs-in-interview-with-uestlove/ |website=Radio.com |access-date=10 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916121400/http://radio.com/2013/10/17/elvis-costello-opens-up-about-1979-racial-slurs-in-interview-with-uestlove/ |archive-date=16 September 2015 }}</ref>

=== 2010 cancelled Tel Aviv concerts ===
In early 2010, Costello was invited to play his first concert in Israel, on 30 June of that year, at the Caesarea Amphitheater north of Tel Aviv.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://igoogledisrael.com/elvis-costello-is-coming-to-israel/|title=Elvis Costello is coming to Israel!|date=15 February 2010|website=igoggledisrael.com|access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref> Due to high demand for tickets, a second concert was added for 1 July.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/1.5104950|title=The bitch, and others, are back|last=Kohavi|first=Noya|date=22 April 2010|website=Haaretz|access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref> At first, Costello seemed resolved to resist political pressure on artists to refrain from performing in Israel due to the country's controversial treatment of Palestinians. In early May, Costello told Israel's largest daily newspaper, ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'', "As soon as you play you are going to get criticised". Costello told the newspaper he did not agree with organisations that "think that they need to boycott Israel to pressure it", saying he thought "culture is the only way in which humanity shares experiences, and that is why I need to come and perform here".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/bowing-to-his-conscience-20100524-w7vx.html|title=Bowing to his conscience|last=Koutsoukis|first=Jason|date=25 May 2010|work=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref> Two weeks later, he announced on his website that he had cancelled the concerts because of what he called the "grave and complex" sensitivities of the [[Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=19 May 2010 |title=Elvis Costello cancels Israel concerts |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-costello-israel-idUSTRE64I30E20100519}}</ref> He told ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' his decision was part of a "30-year conundrum" that he had been dealing with regarding playing in Israel. He also told the ''Post'' that he had not been threatened or coerced, but that he "woke up one day and realised [he] couldn't go on with the shows". The promoters of the concerts expressed shock. Israeli Culture Minister [[Limor Livnat]], a member of the right-wing [[Likud Party]] who opposed the Oslo accords and withdrawal from the occupied territories, denounced the decision. The organisation [[Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel]] praised it.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brinn |first=David |date=20 May 2010 |title=Elvis Costello cancels upcoming show |work=The Jerusalem Post |url=https://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Entertainment/Elvis-Costello-cancels-upcoming-show |access-date=2 August 2023}}</ref>

===Pescatarianism===
A [[pescatarian]] since the early 1980s, Costello says he was moved to reject meat after seeing the documentary ''[[The Animals Film]]'' (1982), which also helped inspire his song "Pills and Soap" from 1983's ''Punch the Clock''.<ref name=NYer2010>{{cite magazine |last1=Paumgarten |first1=Nick |date=8 November 2010 |title=Brilliant Mistake: Elvis Costello's boundless career |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |pages=48â€“59 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/08/101108fa_fact_paumgarten |access-date=22 January 2011 |archive-date=8 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308130521/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/08/101108fa_fact_paumgarten |url-status=live}}</ref> In January 2013, Costello teamed up with Paul McCartney to create an advertisement campaign backing vegetarian foods produced by the [[Linda McCartney Foods]] brand.<ref>{{cite news |title=Elvis Costello voices ad for new Linda McCartney vegetarian food range |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/elvis-costello-voices-ad-for-new-linda-mccartney-vegetarian-food-range-8456232.html |location=London |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Adam |last=Sherwin |date=18 January 2013 |access-date=27 August 2017 |archive-date=3 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303230704/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/elvis-costello-voices-ad-for-new-linda-mccartney-vegetarian-food-range-8456232.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Legacy== 
[[File:Elvis Costello performing in Dublin, Ireland 2024.jpg|thumb|Elvis Costello performing in Dublin, Ireland in 2024]]
Costello is considered by experts in pop and rock music to be one of the best songwriters of his generation. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] summarised Costello as the "most evocative, innovative, and gifted songwriter since Bob Dylan, with songs that offer highly personal takes on love and politics".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/elvis-costello-mn0000058549|title=Elvis Costello|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=AllMusic|access-date=17 June 2018}}</ref> In 2015, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked him 24th their list of the greatest songwriters of all time, calling him a songwriter of "almost unparalleled versatility".<ref name="Rolling Stone-2015"/> When he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016, the induction announcement said the impact of Costello's songs "far out-distanced their commercial performance".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songhall.org/news/view/songwriters_hall_of_fame_announces_2016_inductees1|title=Songwriters Hall Of Fame Announces 2016 Inductees|date=2 March 2016|website=Songwriters Hall of Fame|access-date=17 June 2018}}{{Dead link|date=August 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Musical artists with little connection to new wave have also acknowledged influence by Costello. [[Bruce Springsteen]] has said that comments Costello made in the press criticising Springsteen's early songs as overly romantic led Springsteen to write darker songs for his 1978 album ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lustig |first=Jay |title=Springsteen joins Costello for television Spectacle |url=https://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2010/01/springsteen_joins_costello_for.html |website=NJ.com |date=18 January 2010 |access-date=21 June 2018}}</ref> [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]] called ''Blood & Chocolate'' "the album that made me change the way I thought about recording and writing music [and] lyrics".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Paphides |first=Peter |date=5 November 1997 |title=Radio daze |magazine=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |location=London}}</ref> [[Liz Phair]], in her appreciation of Costello for [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time| ''Rolling Stone''{{'s}} 100 Greatest Artists of All Time]], wrote: "I'd pay a great amount of money to audit a course taught by him".<ref name="RS80">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231|title=100 greatest artists, 80 Elvis Costello|last=Phair|first=Liz|author-link=Liz Phair|date=2 December 2010|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref> [[Suzanne Vega]] has called Costello one of the "melodic geniuses" whose music she listens to in order to "stretch my sense of melody".<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.sodajerker.com/episode-49-suzanne-vega/|title=Sodajerker on Songwriting, ep 49.

Prominent artists in other fields have claimed influence or inspiration from Costello. Filmmaker and comedian [[Judd Apatow]] has called Costello "a gigantic inspiration to me" and has suggested that he and other comedians are "fanatical" about Costello's music because of the "spirit of standing up for what you believe in and the humor" in it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/music/2013/10/elvis-costello-wise-up-ghosts-burt-bacharach|title=Elvis Costello Talks to Judd Apatow About Wise Up Ghost, His Album with the Roots, and His Musical with Burt Bacharach|last=Apatow|first=Judd|date=28 October 2013|website=VanityFair.com|access-date=21 June 2018}}</ref> Satirist and television host Stephen Colbert has described Costello as "probably my favourite rock artist" and said he sees parallels between his own humour and Costello's "wry, sardonic" songs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/10/24/163547250/stephen-colberts-most-meaningful-musical-moments|title=Stephen Colbert's Most Meaningful Musical Moments|last=NPR Staff|date=24 October 2018|website=NPR|access-date=21 June 2018}}</ref> Novelist [[Bret Easton Ellis]] titled his 1985 novel [[Less Than Zero (novel)|''Less Than Zero'']] after a Costello song and its 2010 sequel ''[[Imperial Bedrooms]]'' after a Costello album.
