Their original line-up was composed of [[Alex Kapranos]] (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), [[Nick McCarthy]] (guitar, keyboards, vocals), [[Bob Hardy (bassist)|Bob Hardy]] (bass) , [[Paul Thomson]] (drums, percussion, backing vocals). [[Julian Corrie]] (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals) and [[Dino Bardot]] (guitar, backing vocals) joined the band in 2017 after McCarthy left during the previous year, and [[Audrey Tait]] (drums, percussion) joined the band after Thomson left in 2021. The band were categorised as a [[post-punk revival]] band, and garnered multiple UK top 20 hits in the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/96926-franz-ferdinand-the-heathers-on-fire|title=Franz Ferdinand: The Heather's On Fire|publisher=The Skinny|date=9 October 2009|access-date=9 July 2011}}</ref> They have been nominated for several [[Grammy Awards]] and have received two [[Brit Awards]]—winning one for Best British Group—as well as one [[NME Award]].

The band's 2003 debut single, "[[Darts of Pleasure]]", narrowly missed the top 40 of the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at number 44, but their second single that same year, "[[Take Me Out (song)|Take Me Out]]", yielded their commercial breakthrough, peaking at number three. "Take Me Out" charted in several other countries and earned a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]; it became the band's signature song. Their debut album [[Franz Ferdinand (album)|''Franz Ferdinand'']] won the 2004 [[Mercury Prize]] and earned a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]].

In 2005, the band released their second studio album, ''[[You Could Have It So Much Better]]'', produced by [[Rich Costey]]. It peaked within the top-ten in multiple countries and earned Grammy-nominations for Best Alternative Album and for one of the singles, "[[Do You Want To]]". The band's third studio album, ''[[Tonight: Franz Ferdinand]]'', was released in January 2009; by then the band had shifted from a [[post-punk]]-focused sound to a more [[Dance music|dance]]-oriented sound. A remix album of ''Tonight'', titled ''[[Blood (Franz Ferdinand album)|Blood]]'', was released in July 2009.

Four years after the release of ''Tonight'', the band released their fourth studio album, ''[[Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action]]'', in August 2013.

After acquiring Corrie and Bardot, the band released their fifth studio album ''[[Always Ascending]]'' in February 2018. Thomson departed in 2021 and was replaced by Tait. The band's sixth studio album, ''[[The Human Fear]]'', was released in January 2025 to commercial success.

== History ==

=== Formation (2001–2003) ===
[[File:Franz ferdinand.jpg|thumb|130px|right|The [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] inspired the band's name.]]
The band's members played in various bands during the 1990s, including [[The Karelia]], [[The Yummy Fur|Yummy Fur]], 10p Invaders, and Embryo. Alex Kapranos and Paul Thomson met at a party and began a close friendship and played together in Yummy Fur, and subsequently teamed up to write songs. Around the same time, Kapranos taught his friend Bob Hardy how to play bass after being given a bass by Mick Cooke of [[Belle & Sebastian]]. Kapranos met guitarist Nick McCarthy, who had returned to Scotland after studying [[jazz]] bass in Germany, in 2001.<ref name="hot scots">{{cite magazine|author=Hiatt, Brian|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/franzferdinand/articles/story/7662932/hot_scots|title=Hot Scots|access-date=11 January 2008|date=22 September 2005|magazine=Rolling Stone|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505233241/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/franzferdinand/articles/story/7662932/hot_scots|archive-date=5 May 2009}}</ref>

Once the members came together, they settled on the name Franz Ferdinand for their band. The name was originally inspired by a [[racehorse]] called Archduke Ferdinand.<ref>{{cite news |title=Archduke Ferdinand takes Plate honours |author=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/1415638.stm}}</ref> After seeing the horse win the [[Northumberland Plate]] in 2001, the band began to discuss [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and thought it would be a good band name because of the [[alliteration]] of the name and the implications of the Archduke's death: [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|his assassination]] was a significant factor in the lead-up to [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Hurley |first1=James |last2=Nikolich |first2=Jessica |title=Franz Ferdinand |url=http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/music/galleries/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=148013878&imageindex=8 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620175509/http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/music/galleries/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=148013878&imageindex=8 |archive-date=20 June 2009 |access-date=29 August 2009}}</ref> In an interview, Hardy recollected that "mainly we just liked the way it sounded. We liked the alliteration." Kapranos continued, saying "he was an incredible figure as well. His life, or at least the ending of it, was the catalyst for the complete transformation of the world and that is what we want our music to be. But I don't want to over-intellectualise the name thing. Basically a name should just sound good ... like music." Thomson concluded, saying “I like the idea that, if we become popular, maybe the words Franz Ferdinand will make people think of the band instead of the historical figure.”<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isthismusic.com/franz-ferdinand-a-classic-itm-interview |title=Franz Ferdinand interview – is this music?|website=Isthismusic.com |date=5 September 2010|access-date=5 September 2010}}</ref>

=== ''Franz Ferdinand'' and international breakthrough (2003–2005) ===
{{Main|Franz Ferdinand (album)}}

[[File:Ff04.jpg|thumb|left|The band performing in 2004]]
In May 2003 the band signed to Laurence Bell's [[independent record label]], [[Domino Recording Company]].<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/franz-ferdinand-darts-pleasure-domino|title=Franz Ferdinand, 'Darts of Pleasure' (Domino) &#124; ''Spin''|work=Spin|access-date=27 November 2008}}</ref> The band moved to Gula Studios in [[Malmö]], Sweden, with [[The Cardigans|Cardigans]] producer [[Tore Johansson]] to record their debut album. In the latter part of 2003, the band released their debut single, "[[Darts of Pleasure]]". In January 2004, the single "[[Take Me Out (song)|Take Me Out]]" reached No.&nbsp;3 in the UK charts. The album, ''Franz Ferdinand'', was released in early 2004, debuting at No.&nbsp;3 in the UK Albums Chart in February 2004, and at No.&nbsp;12 in the Australian album charts in April 2004. The album only reached the lowest levels of the Billboard 200 album charts in the US as of early 2004, but reached the top 5 of the [[indie rock]] chart and the Heatseeker chart for debut artists. After a couple of North American tours and heavy rotation of the "Take Me Out" video on [[MTV]], the album eventually reached No.&nbsp;32 on the Billboard 200 later in 2004, and sold over a million copies in the United States.<ref name="hot scots"/> ''Franz Ferdinand'' received a generally strong positive response from critics. ''[[NME]]'' rated it 9 out of 10, and said that the band was the latest in the line of art school rock bands featuring [[the Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], [[Roxy Music]], the [[Sex Pistols]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[Travis (band)|Travis]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]].

On 7 September 2004, the album was awarded the 2004 [[Mercury Music Prize]]. "Take Me Out" gained first place in the Australian [[Triple J Hottest 100]] for 2004, winning more than twice the votes of the second-place entry, with ''[[This Fire (Franz Ferdinand song)|This Fire]]'' and ''[[The Dark of the Matinee]]'' entering at No.&nbsp;24 and No.&nbsp;50 respectively. Franz Ferdinand won an [[Ivor Novello Award]] in 2004 and two [[Brit Awards]] in 2005. The avant-garde music video for "Take Me Out" earned them a [[MTV Video Music Award – Breakthrough Video|Breakthrough Video]] [[MTV Video Music Award|MTV Award]]. ''NME'' named ''Franz Ferdinand'' the best album of 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/albums/oftheyear| title=NME Albums of the Year| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120183219/http://nme.com./reviews/albums/oftheyear| archive-date=20 November 2008| work=[[NME]]}}</ref> and placed it 38th on their ''100 Best Albums of All Time'' list.<ref>{{cite web |title=2006 NME's 100 Best Albums of All Time |url=http://timepieces.nl/chart/20867/2006-nme-100-best-albums-all-time |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118190109/http://timepieces.nl/chart/20867/2006-nme-100-best-albums-all-time |archive-date=18 January 2014 |access-date=27 November 2008 |publisher=Timepieces.nl}}</ref> The band performed "Take Me Out" as a live medley with [[Los Lonely Boys]], [[Maroon 5]], [[The Black Eyed Peas]] and [[Gwen Stefani]] at the [[47th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2005, in which "Take Me Out" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and ''Franz Ferdinand'' was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]]. "Take Me Out" was featured on the video games ''[[NHL 2005]]'', ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]'' and the breakthrough game ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. The album has sold around 3.6 million copies worldwide.

{{Main|You Could Have It So Much Better}}
[[File:Franz-ferdinand-live-2006-tag.jpg|thumb|right|Franz Ferdinand performing live in [[Dundee]], Scotland in 2006]]
The band spent much of 2005 in the studio in Glasgow working on their follow-up album, ''You Could Have It So Much Better'', which was released on 3 October 2005. The band initially intended to leave the album self-titled like their debut,<ref>McLean, Craig. "Ferdinand: No Bull". ''Spin''. September 2005.</ref> but they changed it to ''You Could Have It So Much Better...With Franz Ferdinand'' before settling on the final title.<ref>Spitz, Marc. "Franz Ferdinand". ''Spin''. November 2005.</ref> The album's cover design was modelled on [[Alexander Rodchenko]]'s 1924 portrait of [[Lilya Brik]]. The band attempted to broaden its musical range on the album; Hardy said, "There's more to life than disco-beat guitar music".<ref name="hot scots"/> It was generally well received in the press and seen as an album equal to, or better than, their first by most critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/franz-ferdinand/7790|title=NME Album Reviews – Franz Ferdinand: You Could Have It So Much Better|work=[[NME]]|date=28 September 2005|access-date=5 April 2012}}</ref> It entered the UK Album Charts at Number 1 and the US charts at Number 8. The album eventually sold 2 million copies worldwide.

To support the album, four singles were released. Included in that set is a [[double A-side]] single that contained a video-clip-only single as well (both the AA-side "L. Wells" and the video-clip "Jeremy Fraser" are not featured on the album, recorded in early 2006 during the band's tour of Australia in support of the album). Also included is another video-clip-only single called "Wine, In the Afternoon" which is the B-side to "[[Eleanor Put Your Boots On]]", and was also not featured on the album, but recorded on tour in Michigan. "[[Do You Want To]]" made it to number 4 and was declared by Q to be the greatest single of 2005, while "[[Walk Away (Franz Ferdinand song)|Walk Away]]" and "[[The Fallen (song)|The Fallen]]" entered the top 15 of the UK Singles Chart. The fourth and final single from the second album, "Eleanor Put Your Boots On", peaked at number 30. ''You Could Have It So Much Better'' went on to earn a nomination for Best Alternative Album at the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2006, as did "Do You Want To" for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

[[File:FF2009.jpg|thumb|left|The band performing live in 2009]]

The album, ''Tonight'' was released 26 January 2009 and debuted at No.&nbsp;2 in the [[UK Album Chart]] and No.&nbsp;9 in the [[US Billboard 200]]. The second single, "[[No You Girls]]" saw success both in the charts and on the radio prior to release, eventually reaching No.&nbsp;7 on the US Modern Rock Chart and was performed by Franz Ferdinand on Comic Relief 2009 Top of The Pops special. "[[Can't Stop Feeling]]" was released on 6 July as the third single from the album and on 28 August, "What She Came For" was released as the 4th single in the form of a remix single.

Examples include: "You Could Have It So Much Better", which references a 1924 portrait of [[Lilya Brik]] by [[Alexander Rodchenko]]; "[[Take Me Out (single)|Take Me Out]]", which references ''[[A Sixth Part of the World|One-Sixth Part of the World]],'' also by Alexander Rodchenko; "[[This Fire (Franz Ferdinand song)|This Fire]]" which references ''[[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge]]'' by [[El Lissitzky]]; and "[[Michael (Franz Ferdinand song)|Michael]]", with single art based on ''A Proun'' by Lissitzky. The song "Love and Destroy" was inspired by the scene of disorder made by Margarita, a character of [[Mikhail Bulgakov|Michael Bulgakov]]'s "[[The Master and Margarita]]", in the apartment of the literature critic Latunzky.

Also, in "Outsiders", the lyrics "In seventeen years will you still be [[Camille Claudel|Camille]], [[Lee Miller]], [[Gala Dalí|Gala]] or whatever" are a reference to the lovers of the artists [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Man Ray]] and [[Salvador Dalí]].

The band have been credited with helping to increase the popularity of men's fringed hairstyles.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-21|title=He bangs: why men are getting fringes again|url=http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/oct/21/he-bangs-why-men-are-going-back-to-fringes|access-date=2022-02-08|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

=== Music videos ===
Many of the videos to promote the band's singles take inspiration from Russian [[avant-garde]] much like their LP and CD sleeves.

The avant-garde music video for "Take Me Out", directed by [[Jonas Odell]], was inspired by [[Dada]]ism (especially Max Ernst's ''[[Une Semaine de Bonté]]''), [[Busby Berkeley]] choreographies and Russian [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] design.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?id=16427|title=Franz Ferdinand 'Take Me Out'|work=XFM|access-date=27 September 2014}}</ref> Alex Kapranos explained the many and varied influences behind the 1930s-style promo for second single "Take Me Out": "It's kind of two dimensional in a three dimensional style if that makes any sense. It's a montage of images; ourselves, pictures and things taken from other places and put together in a strange, abstract way. That's what gives the video that strange, jerky, style".<ref name=autogenerated2/>

The lyrics of "Do You Want To" make reference to parties at the "trendy" Glasgow art gallery Transmission, and the video includes a variety of the work of contemporary artist [[Vanessa Beecroft]].
