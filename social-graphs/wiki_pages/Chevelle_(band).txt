'''Chevelle''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Grayslake, Illinois]], in 1995. The band was originally composed of two brothers, [[Pete Loeffler]] (lead vocals and guitar) and Sam Loeffler (drums and percussion), along with Matt Scott (bass and backing vocals). Scott was replaced by Sam and Pete's brother, Joe Loeffler, in 1996. When Joe left the band in 2005, Geno Lenardo subbed in as the touring bassist until he was replaced by Pete and Sam's brother-in-law, [[Dean Bernardini]]. Bernardini departed from the band in 2019, and in 2021, Kemble Walters joined the band as a touring bassist.

The band's first studio album, ''[[Point No. 1|Point #1]]'', was released on a small record label called [[Squint Entertainment]]. Chevelle's second album, ''[[Wonder What's Next]]'' (2002), was certified double platinum by the [[RIAA]] after a debut at No.&nbsp;14 on the United States albums chart, [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''[[This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)]]'' (2004), the band's third album debuted at No.&nbsp;8 and has been certified platinum. Chevelle has since released seven more albums: ''[[Vena Sera]]'' (2007), ''[[Sci-Fi Crimes]]'' (2009), ''[[Hats Off to the Bull]]'' (2011), ''[[La Gárgola]]'' (2014), ''[[The North Corridor]]'' (2016), ''[[NIRATIAS]]'' (2021), and ''[[Bright as Blasphemy]]'' (2025). Other releases from Chevelle include two live albums, two DVDs, and two compilation albums. As of 2022, the band has sold over 6 million records.

Corey Apar of AllMusic states that "''Vena Sera'' probably won't disappoint fans, and it didn't, if for the sole fact that it basically sounds just like Chevelle's other albums".
