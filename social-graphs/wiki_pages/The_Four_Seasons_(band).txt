'''The Four Seasons''' are<!-- Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both American English and British English. Please do not change "are" to "is". --> an American band formed in 1960 in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. Since 1970, they have also been known at times as '''Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons'''. They are one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling musical groups of all time]], having sold an estimated 100 million records worldwide.<ref name="stone">{{cite magazine |title=Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/frankievallithefourseasons/biography |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090206230414/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/frankievallithefourseasons/biography |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-02-06 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>

The band evolved out of a previous band called [[the Four Lovers]], with [[Frankie Valli]] on lead vocals, [[Bob Gaudio]] on keyboards and vocals, [[Tommy DeVito (musician)|Tommy DeVito]] on guitar and vocals, and [[Nick Massi]] on bass and vocals. The Four Seasons had two distinct eras of widespread success: the 1960s, during which Massi departed in 1965, and was replaced initially by [[Charles Calello]] and more permanently by [[Joe Long]], and the mid- to late 1970s, with the lineup consisting of Valli, [[Don Ciccone]] (bass and vocals), John Paiva (guitar and vocals), [[Gerry Polci]] (drums and vocals), and [[Lee Shapiro (musician)|Lee Shapiro]] (keyboards), with Gaudio still working with the band as a non-performing songwriter and producer.

The legal name of the organization is the Four Seasons Partnership, formed by Valli and Gaudio, and was taken after a failed audition in 1960.

==History==
===1953–1960: Before the Four Seasons===
{{main|The Four Lovers}}
Frankie Valli's first commercial release was "My Mother's Eyes" (as Frankie Valley) in 1953. The following year, he and guitarist Tommy DeVito formed '''the Variatones''' (with Hank Majewski, rhythm guitar, Frank Cottone, accordion, and Billy Thompson, drums),<ref name=bimbamboom>Walter Gollender. ''Bim Bam Boom No. 8'' (December 1972).</ref> which between 1954 and 1956 performed and recorded under a variety of names before settling on the name '''the Four Lovers''', based upon a [[Latin lover]] gimmick<ref name="Bronson">{{cite book|author=Bronson, Fred|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|edition=3rd|publisher=Billboard Books|year=1992|isbn=0-8230-8298-9}}</ref><ref>Joe Sasfy.

From 1956 until 1958, the group stayed together, performing in clubs and lounges as the Four Lovers and recording on music labels under various names: Frankie Tyler, Frankie Valli, Frankie Valli and the Travelers, Frankie Valli and the Romans, the Village Voices, and the Topics are some of the 18 "stage names" used individually or collectively by the members of the band. Majewski left the band due to creative differences,<ref name=bimbamboom/> while Nick DeVito left the group (portrayed in ''Jersey Boys'' as being due to an extended prison sentence, though Tommy DeVito stated in 2008 that he had fired the two because he had booked a gig opening up for [[Tony Bennett]], believing it would be the group's big break, only for Majewski and Nick DeVito to refuse to travel several hundred miles to the venue, forcing him to cancel).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2008/apr/02/vegas-man-knows-jersey-boys/|title=Vegas man knows 'Jersey Boys'|first=Jerry|last=Fink|date=April 2, 2008|website=Lasvegassun.com|access-date=September 23, 2020}}</ref> To fill the gap, two members of the Hollywood Playboys, another touring group in North Jersey, joined Valli and Tommy DeVito: lead keyboardist Hugh Garrity and guitarist [[Nick Massi|Nickie Massey]],<ref name=bimbamboom/><ref>Florio, Steve (December 28, 2000).

In 1959, the band started working with [[Record producer|producer]]/[[songwriter]] [[Bob Crewe]], primarily for [[session musician|session work]] (Crewe wrote "I Go Ape", which Valli recorded with the intention of releasing it as a "solo" single, only to be beaten to the punch by an [[I Go Ape|unrelated song of the same name]] from [[Neil Sedaka]], who became friends with Valli later on). Later that year, the Four Lovers were performing in [[Baltimore]] on the same stage as the [[Royal Teens]], who were riding the wave of success of "[[Short Shorts]]", a song co-written by then-15-year-old [[Bob Gaudio]], who was also the Royal Teens' keyboardist. In late 1959, Gaudio became the group's keyboardist; Garrity returned to the Hollywood Playboys without Massey, who briefly launched a solo career.<ref>"Record Reviews." [https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/50s/1959/CB-1959-10-24.pdf ''Cashbox''. October 24, 1959]. p. 12</ref> During this time, [[Charles Calello]] filled in as the fourth member of the quartet. Early in 1960, a now-renamed Nick Massi returned, now playing [[electric bass]] in addition to vocals and arrangement duties.

In 1960, despite the changes of personnel, the fortunes of the Four Lovers had not changed—they failed an audition for a lounge at a [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey]] bowling establishment. According to Gaudio, "We figured we'll come out of this with something. So we took the name of the bowling alley. It was called the Four Seasons." Despite the last few years of frustration of the Four Lovers, this proved to be the turning point for the band. Later, on a handshake agreement between keyboardist/composer Bob Gaudio and lead singer Frankie Valli, the Four Seasons Partnership was formed.

===1961–1963: Rise===
The Four Seasons signed as artists to Crewe's production company, and they released their first Crewe-produced single under their new name in 1961 ("[[Bermuda (song)|Bermuda]]"/"Spanish Lace" on [[Gone Records]]); the non-charting record would be their only record for Gone, which was itself gone by July 1962 when [[Morris Levy]] bought and dissolved the label.<ref>"Roulette Unveils Billing Plan; Absorbs Gone and End Records." ''Billboard Music Week''. July 7, 1962. p. 22</ref> The band continued working with producer Bob Crewe as background vocalists and sometimes leads under different names, for productions on Crewe's own Topix label. As a follow-up, Bob Gaudio wrote a song that, after some discussion between Crewe and Gaudio, was titled "Sherry". After the song was recorded, Crewe and the members of the band solicited record labels to release it. It was Frankie Valli who spoke with [[Randy Wood (music executive)|Randy Wood]], West Coast sales manager for [[Vee-Jay Records]] (not [[Randy Wood (record producer)|the founder]] of [[Dot Records]]) who, in turn, suggested the release of "Sherry" to the decision-makers at Vee-Jay. "Sherry" made enough of an impression that Crewe was able to sign a deal between his production company and Vee-Jay for its release. They were the first white artists to sign with Vee-Jay.<ref>''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]''. Issue 60. May 1981.</ref>

In 1962, the band released their first album, featuring the single "[[Sherry (song)|Sherry]]", which drew the attention of [[WPOP]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], known for launching new hit songs; WPOP disc jockey [[Joey Reynolds]] heavily promoted the record.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=2002-11-10 |title=JOEY ALL NIGHT |url=https://www.courant.com/2002/11/10/joey-all-night/ |access-date=2024-03-08 |website=Hartford Courant |language=en-US}}</ref> "Sherry" gave the Four Seasons their first #1 song. Under the guidance of Bob Crewe, the Four Seasons followed up "Sherry" with several [[music recording sales certification|million-selling]] singles, generally composed by Crewe and Gaudio, including "[[Big Girls Don't Cry (The Four Seasons song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]" (their second #1 hit), "[[Walk Like a Man (The Four Seasons song)|Walk Like a Man]]" (their third #1), "[[Candy Girl (The Four Seasons song)|Candy Girl]]" (written by [[Larry Santos]]), "[[Ain't That a Shame]]", and several others. Also, they released a Christmas album in December 1962 and charted with a unique rendition of "[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]".

From 1962 to early 1964, [[the Beach Boys]] were the only band to match the Four Seasons in record sales in the United States, and their first three Vee-Jay non-holiday single releases (i.e., ignoring their version of "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town") marked the first time that a rock band hit #1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' singles charts with three consecutive entries.

In 1962, they were invited to perform their hit "[[Big Girls Don't Cry (The Four Seasons song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]" on the show ''[[American Bandstand]].''

===1964: From Vee-Jay to Philips===
In January 1964, after several successful albums but a lack of money from Vee-Jay, the Seasons left Vee-Jay and moved to [[Philips Records]], then a division of [[Mercury Records]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0UEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22vee-jay%22+%2B+%22four+seasons%22+%2B+crewe+%2B+%22philips+records%22&pg=PA6 |title=Billboard – Google Books |date=1964-01-18 |access-date=2011-07-16}}</ref> In the 1965 settlement of a lawsuit between the two parties, Vee-Jay retained release rights for all material the band recorded for the label. Vee-Jay exercised those rights liberally over the following year. The group was obligated to deliver one final album to Vee-Jay, which they did in the form of a "faux" live LP. At the same time, Vee-Jay was overwhelmed when it found itself as the rightsholder not only to the Four Seasons, but [[the Beatles]], which it had acquired in a sidecar deal with [[Frank Ifield]] in 1962;<ref>[http://www.archer2000.com/chronicles/Labels/VeeJay.html Chris Norby, "Vee-Jay label"], '' Archer2000.com''. Retrieved 19 January 2017</ref> unable to meet demand for both bands, and with the Beatles' rights eventually reverting to [[Capitol Records]] in October 1964 after another protracted legal battle,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/howtheybecamebea0000pawl|url-access=registration|quote=gareth how they became the beatles.|title=How they became the Beatles|via=[[Internet Archive]]|publisher=E.P. Dutton|access-date=2012-08-14|isbn=9780525248231|year=1989}}</ref> Vee-Jay was finally declared bankrupt in 1966. With the bankruptcy, the Four Seasons' Vee-Jay catalog reverted to the band, who promptly licensed the rights to Philips.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AhEEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22vee-jay%22+%2B+auction&pg=PA7 |title=Billboard – Google Books |date=1966-08-13 |access-date=2011-07-16}}</ref> 

The change of label did not diminish the popularity of the Four Seasons in 1964, nor did the onslaught of the [[British Invasion]] and [[Beatlemania]]. However, "[[Dawn (Go Away)]]" was kept from the #1 spot on the Hot 100 by no fewer than three [[The Beatles|Beatles]] singles in the March 21, 1964, edition (two weeks later, the top five slots were filled by Beatles singles). In a two-record set dubbed ''[[The Beatles vs. the Four Seasons|The Beatles vs the Four Seasons: The International Battle of the Century!]]'', Vee-Jay created an elaborate two-disc package that the purchaser could use to write on and score individual recordings by their favorite artist. The discs were reissues of the albums ''[[Introducing... The Beatles]]'' and ''[[Golden Hits of the Four Seasons]]'', featuring each original album's label, title, and catalog number. Today, this album package is a collector's item.<ref>{{cite web|last1=York|first1=Robert|title=The Beatles vs the Four Seasons|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~bpentium/beatles/seasons.html|website=The Beatles at the Web Spot|publisher=Robert's Web Spot|access-date=9 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009043442/http://www.eskimo.com/~bpentium/beatles/seasons.html|archive-date=9 October 2011}}</ref> Valli credited the band's continued success in the face of the British Invasion to staying true to their original mission of an original sound and not trying to imitate British acts.<ref name=vallis2023interview>{{Cite web |last=Willman |first=Chris |date=2023-08-27 |title=Frankie Valli on the Four Seasons' Legacy and Their Massive New 45-Disc Boxed Set: 'We Didn't Want to Try to Sound Like Anybody Else' |url=https://variety.com/2023/music/news/frankie-valli-four-seasons-boxed-set-ultimate-collection-interview-1235705611/ |access-date=2023-08-27 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref> The summer of 1964 saw the Seasons achieve their fourth US #1 single with "[[Rag Doll (The_Four_Seasons_song)|Rag Doll]]", which also became their biggest hit in the UK to that point, reaching #2 there.

===1965–1968: Departure of Nick Massi; One band, several acts===
[[File:Charles Calello Conducting.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Calello]] (seen here in 2018), in addition to briefly being a band member in 1965, did extensive arrangement for Valli and the Seasons throughout the 1960s and 1970s.]]
Nick Massi left the Four Seasons in September 1965, the same month another big hit for the band, the #3 charted "[[Let's Hang On!]]", was released. Although this was Massi's last "Four Seasons" single, he also appeared on the band's follow-up single, a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]", which was issued under the name "[[the Wonder Who?]]", and went top 20. The band's musical arranger, [[Charles Calello]] (a former member of the Four Lovers), stepped in as a temporary replacement. During Calello's brief tenure as a member, the band scored their first hit without Massi, "[[Working My Way Back to You]]", which went top 10. A few months later, [[Joe Long]] was hired to replace Calello, who returned to his role as musical arranger. Long would be a member of the band, on bass and backing vocals, until 1975. His first single with the Four Seasons was "[[Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'bout Me)]]", which reached #13 in mid-1966. 

Massi's departure coincided with the addition of new songwriters, such as [[Sandy Linzer]] and [[Denny Randell]], who eased the burden on Gaudio, while Randell absorbed some of Massi's arranging duties.<ref>McIntosh, Danny (November 7, 2011). [https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/denny-randell Songfacts Interview with Denny Randell], Retrieved September 27, 2023.</ref> This period also saw Valli launch a parallel solo career, although every Valli "solo" recording from 1965's "[[The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)]]" to 1974's "[[My Eyes Adored You]]" was recorded with the Four Seasons at the same time and in the same sessions as material released under the Four Seasons' name; these were usually distinguished in that material written and marketed as Valli solo numbers did not have Valli's trademark falsetto.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://frankievallifourseasons.com/bio/ |title =Bio – Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons|date =September 14, 2019}}</ref> Valli's first post-1960 single without the Seasons was 1975's "[[Swearin' to God]]".

More top 20 singles followed in 1966 and 1967, including "[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]", "[[Beggin']]" (later covered by Norwegian duo [[Madcon]] and Italian band [[Måneskin]]), "[[Tell It to the Rain]]", and "[[C'mon Marianne]]", as well as Valli "solo" singles "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]" and "I Make a Fool of Myself". Also, other Crewe/Gaudio songs that did not become hits for either Valli or the Four Seasons became international hits in cover versions, such as "[[Silence Is Golden (song)|Silence Is Golden]]" for [[the Tremeloes]] and "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)" for [[the Walker Brothers]]. 1968's "[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow]]" would be the band's last top 40 hit for seven years, reaching #24, following Valli's last "solo" hit of the 1960s, the #29 charted "To Give (The Reason I Live)".

===1969–1975: ''The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette''; Departure of Tommy DeVito; Declining record sales; Move to Motown===
By 1969, the band's popularity had declined, with public interest moving towards rock with a harder edge and music with more socially conscious lyrics. Aware of that, Bob Gaudio partnered with folk-rock songwriter [[Jake Holmes]] to write a concept album titled ''[[The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette]]'', which discussed contemporary issues from the band's standpoint, including divorce ("Saturday's Father"), and [[Kinks]]-style satirical looks at modern life (e.g., "American Crucifixion and Resurrection" and "Genuine Imitation Life"). The decision to create a concept album was a major departure for the group, which Bob Crewe had purposely marketed as a singles act (so much so that the group's early albums were simply the name of a major hit single appended with [[snowclone|some variation of]] "and Other Songs").<ref name=vallis2023interview/>

The album cover was designed to resemble the front page of a newspaper, pre-dating [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]'s ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'' by three years. The record was a commercial failure (by the group's usual standards; according to Stuart Miller, owner of a Four Seasons fansite named after the album, and Joe Long, the album sold about 150,000 copies)<ref name="Joe Long interview with Stuart Miller">{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Stuart |last2=Long |first2=Joe |title=Joe Long: His Story |url= http://www.genuine-imitation-life-gazette.com/Bios/Long_Bio.html |date=2004|website=The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040724113020/http://www.genuine-imitation-life-gazette.com/Bios/Long_Bio.html|archive-date=24 July 2004}}</ref> and led to the band's departure from Philips shortly after that, but it did catch the attention of [[Frank Sinatra]], whose 1969 album, ''[[Watertown (album)|Watertown]]'', involved Gaudio, Holmes, Valli and Calello. The Seasons' last single on Philips, 1970's "Patch of Blue", featured the band's name as "Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons", but the change in billing did not revive the band's fortunes. Reverting to the "Four Seasons" billing without Valli's name upfront, the group issued a single on Crewe's eponymous label, a rendition of "[[And That Reminds Me]]", which peaked at #45 on the Billboard chart. Frustrated by the group's workload, and facing debts from gambling and a divorce, DeVito accepted a buyout and left the band in 1970.<ref name=lvinterview>{{Cite web|last=Elfman|first=Doug|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/how-a-jersey-boy-worked-his-way-back/|title=How a Jersey boy worked his way back|website=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=June 1, 2009|access-date=November 23, 2021}}</ref> Following a UK tour with Bob Grimm on guitar, the Seasons hired [[Demetri Callas]] as DeVitto's permanent replacement.

After leaving Philips, the Four Seasons recorded a one-off single for the [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] label in England, "Sleeping Man", backed by "Whatever You Say", which was never released in the USA. John Stefan, the band's lead trumpeter, arranged the horn parts. Following that single, the band signed to [[Motown]]. The first LP, ''[[Chameleon (The Four Seasons album)|Chameleon]]'', released by Motown subsidiary label [[Motown#Secondary R&B labels|MoWest Records]] in 1972, failed to sell. A 1971 Frankie Valli solo single on Motown, "Love Isn't Here", and two Four Seasons singles, "Walk On, Don't Look Back" on MoWest in 1972, and "How Come" on Motown in 1973, sank without a trace. A song from ''Chameleon'', "[[The Night (Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons song)|The Night]]", later became a [[Northern Soul]] hit and reached the top 10 of the [[UK Singles Chart]], but was not commercially released in the United States as a single, although promotional copies were distributed in 1972, showing the artist as Frankie Valli. Valli has consistently spoken of how much of the group's late 1960s and early 1970s material was poorly marketed and only later received the appreciation that he felt it deserved.<ref name=vallis2023interview/>

Over the course of this period, a new lineup of the Four Seasons would slowly be assembled. In 1972, Gaudio stopped touring with the band, to focus on songwriting, production, and recording.  Long later told a Four Seasons fansite that he believed that Gaudio stopped touring because of constant stage fright.<ref name="Joe Long interview with Stuart Miller"></ref> His divorce from his first wife was also affecting him at the time, as was the worsening relationship between the band and an increasingly erratic Bob Crewe, forcing Gaudio to take over Crewe's responsibilities.<ref name=":1">Seasonally.co.uk - [https://www.seasonally.co.uk/The%20Four%20Seasons%20at%20Motown%20Part%202.pdf Page 2 ''The Four Seasons at Motown—Part 2'']</ref> The band recruited Clay Jordan as their new keyboardist; Jordan was unable to handle the vocal strain of Gaudio's tenor parts,<ref name=":1" /> and Valli recruited 19-year old [[Lee Shapiro (musician)|Lee Shapiro]] the following year. Shapiro would also become the band's musical arranger and would contribute to the songwriting.<ref name="JChronicle" /> Shortly before Shapiro's arrival, a member of the group's backing band recruited drummer [[Gerry Polci]], who would eventually take over a large portion of lead vocals to ease the load on Frankie Valli, who was gradually losing his hearing due to [[otosclerosis]], though eventually surgery restored most of it.<ref name="gjames" />

In late 1973 and early 1974, the Four Seasons recorded eight songs for a second MoWest album. These sessions marked the return of Nick Massi to the studio for arrangement and vocal work,<ref name=":1" /> and were where Gaudio met his next songwriting partner and future wife, [[Judy Parker]].<ref name="obituary">{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=September 2017 |title=Judy Gaudio, Co-Writer of Four Seasons Hits, Dies |url=https://bestclassicbands.com/judy-parker-gaudio-9-19-17/ |access-date=2024-01-12 |website=Best Classic Bands |language=en-GB}}</ref> The sessions produced the single "Hickory," a minor hit— it peaked at #90 on the ''Cash Box'' charts—despite no promotion from MoWest, which was winding down operations and dropped the band without releasing the unfinished album (it would eventually be released as ''Inside You'', branded as a Valli solo album in 1975).<ref name=":1" /> On behalf of the Four Seasons Partnership, Valli tried to purchase the entire collection of master recordings the group had made for Motown and MoWest. After hearing the amount needed to buy them all, Valli arranged to purchase "[[My Eyes Adored You]]" for $4,000.<ref name="vallis2023interview" /> He took the tape to [[Larry Uttal]], the owner and founder of [[Private Stock Records]], who wanted to release it as a Frankie Valli solo single. Although the band remained unsigned in the later part of 1974, Valli had a new label—and a new solo career.

Following Demetri Callas' departure in 1974, Polci recommended [[the Happenings]]' guitarist John Paiva (who had also worked as a session musician) as replacement.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Limnios |first=Michael |date=January 26, 2012 |title=An Interview with the brilliant guitarist John Paiva: I have learned from everyone including my students.

===1975–1977: Signing with Warner Bros.; Resurgence of commercial success===
As "My Eyes Adored You" climbed the Hot 100 singles chart in early 1975, Uttal was persuaded to release ''[[The Four Seasons Story]]'', a two-record compilation of the band's biggest hit singles from 1962 to 1970. It quickly became a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]], selling over one million copies before the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] started awarding [[Music recording sales certification|platinum records]] for million-selling albums.  Uttal was unwilling to sign the group as a whole, but left a loophole in Valli's contract allowing him to stay with the group if they signed with another label. Gaudio then approached [[Mike Curb]] with a new song, "[[Who Loves You (song)|Who Loves You]]," with Ciccone on lead vocal due to Valli being overseas during the recording; Curb, who appreciated the band for their drug-free, clean-cut reputation,<ref name="cleanlooks">{{cite web |author=Beverly Keel |date=October 2, 1997 |title=Can Mike Curb Be as Clean as He Looks? |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/can-mike-curb-be-as-clean-as-he-looks/content/?oid=1181622 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404192940/https://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/can-mike-curb-be-as-clean-as-he-looks/content/?oid=1181622 |archive-date=April 4, 2012 |access-date=September 22, 2021 |work=[[Nashville Scene]]}}</ref> helped secure an agreement with [[Warner Bros. Records]], who was intrigued by a new Four Seasons lead singer. Valli was unwilling to give up lead vocal duties and managed to halt the release of "Who Loves You" until he could replace Ciccone's vocal with his own.<ref name=james-ciccone/> Long departed the band following the release of "Who Loves You," amid disagreements with the newer, younger members of the band; Ciccone would take over as the band's bassist full-time after Long's resignation.<ref name="Joe Long interview with Stuart Miller" /> The album ''[[Who Loves You]]'' became a surprise million-seller for the band, as Valli ultimately agreed to cede some lead vocals to Polci and Ciccone, making it the first album since Massi's departure to feature a lead or co-lead other than Valli prominently.

In 1975, record sales exploded for both Valli and the Four Seasons as both acts had million-selling singles in the United States ("My Eyes Adored You" hit #1 on the Hot 100 for Valli in March, "Who Loves You" (with Valli on lead) peaked at #3 in November for the band and #6 in the UK chart). In the United Kingdom, [[Motown|Tamla Motown]] released "The Night" as a single on the 'Mowest' label and saw it reach the #7 position on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. "My Eyes Adored You" was also a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom in February of that year. Valli had his first truly solo hit in the summer of 1975 when the Bob Crewe-produced "[[Swearin' to God]]" followed "My Eyes Adored You" into the upper reaches of the Hot 100, peaking at the #6 position and capitalizing on the growing disco craze. The song was released in three forms: the eight-minute album version, the ten-minute extended [[12-inch single]] version, and the four-minute single version. This record featured [[Patti Austin]] on bridge vocals before she became well known. Valli followed this with a discofied #11 hit version of [[Ruby & the Romantics]]' "[[Our Day Will Come]]", also featuring Austin.

The Four Seasons opened 1976 atop the Billboard chart with their fifth #1 single, "[[December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)]]", co-written by Bob Gaudio and Judy Parker. The single also hit #1 in the United Kingdom. "December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)" had Polci singing lead on the verses, Ciccone featured on specific sections, and Valli on lead vocals only on the two bridge sections and backup vocals on the chorus.

Although the band also scored minor chart placements with "[[Silver Star (The Four Seasons song)|Silver Star]]" (with Valli on harmony vocals) (#38 in 1976) and "Down the Hall" (#65 in 1977), both sung by Polci, and "Spend the Night in Love" (#91 in 1980), which again featured Polci as main lead vocalist and Valli singing the bridge section and contributing to backup group vocals, "December, 1963" marked the end of the Seasons' hit-making run. Both singles were hits in the United Kingdom, with "Silver Star" making the top 10. (A dance remix of "December, 1963" returned them briefly to the upper reaches of the ''Billboard'' singles charts almost two decades later).

The success of ''Who Loves You'' increased the popularity of the Four Seasons as a touring group and reignited recording unit. In 1977, the band recorded ''Helicon'' as a follow-up to ''Who Loves You''; it proved to be not as successful, with its lone American single "Down the Hall" peaking in the lower half of the Hot 100 and narrowly reaching the top 40 of the American [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|easy listening charts]] and the UK charts. Additional top-40 UK hits would come with "Rhapsody," and a non-album [[cover version]] of [[the Beatles]]' "[[We Can Work It Out]]" (from ''[[All This and World War II]]'').

However, the record did not sell well. Even after the rise and fall of the band's sales in the disco era, the Four Seasons, in one version or another, continued to be a popular touring act.  

In August 1985, MCA Records released the band album ''Streetfighter'', which yielded two singles in the title track and "Book of Love", a [[post-disco]]-style revamp of the Monotones' 1957 recording.  In September 1992, the band released an album entitled ''Hope + Glory'' on the MCA/Curb label; this is the most recent band studio album to date, but Valli has released three solo albums since then.

A 3CD + 1DVD box set ''...Jersey Beat... The Music of Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons'' was released in mid-2007, marketed as the most comprehensive collection of Four Seasons music yet. The album title ''Jersey Beat'' is a play on ''[[Jersey Boys]],'' a successful Broadway musical about the Four Seasons, as well as on ''[[Mersey Beat]]'', a term first coined as the title of a music magazine published in Liverpool, England, from 1961, but subsequently also used to describe Liverpool's "beat music" culture of the early 1960s.

In 2008, the Four Seasons' "Beggin'" was revived by two acts. Pilooski made an electro remix of that song, while rap act [[Madcon]] used it as the basis of their song "Beggin'". The latter reached number 5 in the UK charts and was a hit across Europe. The song was featured in a TV commercial for [[adidas]] shoes entitled "Celebrate Originality". The Adidas commercial is a popular hit on [[YouTube]] and features a house party with famous celebrities such as [[David Beckham]], [[Russel Simmons]], [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Katy Perry]], and [[Mark Gonzales]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT3Jj9OGMA0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704231449/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT3Jj9OGMA0|url-status=dead|title=YouTube|archive-date=July 4, 2015|website=Youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2011/12/frankie_valli_the_original_jer.html | title=Frankie Valli, the original Jersey Boy, can't wait to get to Cleveland for two shows Dec. 10–11 at Palace Theatre | website=Cleveland.com | date=December 9, 2011 | access-date=June 29, 2012}}</ref> Also in 2008, Gaudio and Robinson recorded ''Jersey Babys: The Instrumental Music of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons for Kids'', an instrumental [[children's music|children's album]], under the Four Seasons brand but without Valli's direct involvement.

A limited-edition 44-disc career box set called ''Working Our Way Back to You: The Ultimate Collection'' was initially going to be released in the summer of 2021 by The Four Seasons Partnership and Snapper Records,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://allyourscreens.com/en/component/k2/item/688-2021-brings-long-awaited-44-cd-career-set-for-four-seasons-fans | title=2021 Brings Long-Awaited 44-Disc Career Set For Four Seasons Fans | website=AllYourScreens.com | date=January 9, 2021 | access-date=March 9, 2021}}</ref> but it missed the release due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the box set was later rescheduled for release on December 9, 2022, before the release date was pushed back to April 14, 2023. The box set was eventually released on June 2, 2023, by The Four Seasons Partnership and Madfish/Snapper Music. It includes every album released by the band (including both mono and stereo mixes, where available), a CD of unreleased tracks from the band's Mowest years, three live shows taken from soundboard recordings as well as numerous other rare tracks and alternative versions.

The Four Seasons announced their farewell tour, The Last Encores Tour, to run through 2024, including several extended stays at the [[Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino]].<ref name=farewelltour>{{Cite web |date=2023-10-04 |title=Frankie Valli Announces "The Last Encores" 2023-2024 Tour Dates |url=https://consequence.net/2023/10/frankie-valli-four-seasons-last-encores-2023-2024-tour-dates/ |access-date=2023-10-05 |language=en-US}}</ref> In an interview with the ''Los Angeles Times'', Valli did not rule out future appearances after the tour, stating that "I'm not sure whether I'm gonna keep going out."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wood |first=Mikael |date=2023-10-25 |title=At 89, Frankie Valli is ready for one last encore |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-10-25/frankie-valli-four-seasons-beggin |access-date=2023-10-26 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> The tour was eventually extended into 2025, with representatives for Valli responding to criticism of him touring at such an advanced age and fears of [[elder abuse]] by assuring that Valli was "doing just fine and super happy to be still performing."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jordan |first=Chris |date=2024-08-14 |title=Frankie Valli, 90, pushes back at critics who say he's too old to perform |url=https://www.aol.com/frankie-valli-90-pushes-back-192535680.html |access-date=2024-08-29 |website=Asbury Park Press via AOL |language=en-US}}</ref> In a statement to ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', Valli indicated a willingness to continue performing as long as audiences continued to buy tickets, responding to accusations of [[lip sync]]ing by noting that his touring production was using a strategy it had long relied on for studio recordings "layering vocals and instruments" to allow the Seasons to maintain a sound similar to that heard in the 1960s despite Valli's age.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Frankie Valli Breaks Silence After Performance Videos Spark Concern: Nobody Is 'Forcing Me to Go on Stage' (Exclusive) |url=https://people.com/frankie-valli-speaks-out-after-performance-videos-spark-concern-exclusive-8720930 |access-date=2024-10-04 |website=People.com |language=en}}</ref>

Throughout the Four Seasons' {{years ago|1960}}-year existence, no incarnation of the group has ever won a competitive [[Grammy Award]]. In 2025, Valli was awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]], the only Grammy the group has yet received.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/news/2025-grammys-special-merit-awards-recipients|title=The Recording Academy Announces 2025 Special Merit Award Honorees: Prince, The Clash, Taj Mahal, Roxanne Shante & Many More |publisher=GRAMMY.com |date=2024-12-20}}</ref>

==''Jersey Boys''==
{{See also|Jersey Boys|Jersey Boys (film)}}
''Jersey Boys'', a [[musical theatre|musical play]] based on the lives of the Four Seasons and directed by [[Des McAnuff]] (''[[The Who's Tommy]]'', ''[[700 Sundays]])'', premiered at his [[La Jolla Playhouse]] and opened on November 6, 2005, to generally positive reviews. It subsequently won multiple [[Tony Award]]s after its move to Broadway. The original cast included [[John Lloyd Young]] as Frankie Valli, Daniel Reichard as Bob Gaudio, Christian Hoff as Tommy DeVito, and J. Robert Spencer as Nick Massi.<ref name="story">{{cite book|year=2007|publisher=Broadway Books|title=Jersey Boys: The Story of Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons|first=David|last=Cote|isbn=978-0-7679-2843-4}}</ref> The play portrays the history of the Four Seasons in four parts, with each part narrated by a different member of the band and supposedly reflecting that band member's perspective on the band's history. The author of the book of the play, Rick Elice, interviewed Valli, Gaudio, and DeVito in writing the play, and pieced together Nick Massi's point of view based on those interviews (Massi had died before the play was written.) The Broadway production won four 2006 Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Actor (for [[John Lloyd Young]] as Frankie Valli), Best Featured Actor (for Christian Hoff as Tommy DeVito), and Best Lighting Design. There are currently three U.S. productions of ''Jersey Boys'' running outside New York and other productions overseas including productions in Toronto, London, Australia, South Africa and The Netherlands.

The [[Jersey Boys (film)|movie adaptation]], directed and produced by [[Clint Eastwood]], starred [[John Lloyd Young]] as Frankie Valli, [[Vincent Piazza]] as Tommy DeVito, Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi and [[Erich Bergen]] as Bob Gaudio. This film was released on June 20, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womanaroundtown.com/sections/playing-around/clint-eastwood-is-bringing-jersey-boys-to-the-big-screen|title=Clint Eastwood Is Bringing Jersey Boys to the Big Screen|work=Woman Around Town}}</ref>
