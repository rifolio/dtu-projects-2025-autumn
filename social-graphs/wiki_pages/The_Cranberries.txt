'''The Cranberries''' were<!--This article is written in Irish English. Do not change to was!--> an Irish [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Limerick]] in 1989. The band was composed of lead singer and guitarist [[Dolores O'Riordan]], guitarist [[Noel Hogan]], bassist Mike Hogan (Noel's brother), and drummer Fergal Lawler.  O'Riordan replaced founding member Niall Quinn in 1990. The band,  originally named The Cranberry Saw Us, was renamed after the addition of O'Riordan. The band classified themselves as an [[alternative rock]] group, but they incorporated into their sound elements of [[indie rock]], [[jangle pop]], [[dream pop]], [[folk rock]], [[post-punk]], and [[pop rock]].

In 1991, the Cranberries signed with [[Island Records]].   They released their debut album, ''[[Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?]]'' (1993), to commercial success. Their second album, ''[[No Need to Argue]]'' (1994), brought the band to international fame and included the single "[[Zombie (The Cranberries song)|Zombie]],"  which became a [[stadium anthem]] and one of the band's most recognizable songs. The band continued this success with the albums ''[[To the Faithful Departed]]'' (1996) and [[Bury the Hatchet (album)|''Bury the Hatchet'']] (1999). 

They transferred to [[MCA Records]] in 2000. Their fifth album, ''[[Wake Up and Smell the Coffee]]'' (2001), did not meet the commercial success of their preceding albums, and the band cited their dissatisfaction with MCA's promotion.

Following a six-year hiatus from 2003 to 2009, the Cranberries embarked on a [[North American]] tour that was followed by shows in Latin America and Europe. They released their sixth album, ''[[Roses (The Cranberries album)|Roses]]'' (2012), their first album in eleven years since ''Wake Up and Smell the Coffee.'' They expanded their musical style with their seventh [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] album, ''[[Something Else (The Cranberries album)|Something Else]]'' (2017). Following O'Riordan's death from drowning due to alcohol intoxication in 2018, Noel Hogan confirmed that the remaining members chose to disband out of respect for her. They disbanded after the release of their acclaimed final album, ''[[In the End (album)|In the End]]'' (2019).

The Cranberries were one of the best-selling alternative acts of the 1990s, having sold nearly 50 million albums worldwide as of 2019. They won an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]], a [[Juno Awards|Juno Award]], an [[MTV Europe Music Award]], and a [[World Music Award]].  They were nominated for a [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] and a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]]. The [[music video]] for "Zombie" is the first by an Irish band to reach one billion views on [[List of most-viewed YouTube videos#Billion-View Club|YouTube]].
