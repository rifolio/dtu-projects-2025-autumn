'''The Kinks''' were an English rock band formed in London in 1963 by brothers [[Ray Davies|Ray]] and [[Dave Davies]], and [[Pete Quaife]]. They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s.<ref name="AllMusic" /><ref name="Hall Bio" /> The band emerged during the height of [[British rhythm and blues]] and [[Merseybeat]], and were briefly part of the [[British Invasion]] of the United States until their [[The Kinks' 1965 US tour#Ban|touring ban]] in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned "[[You Really Got Me]]",<ref name="Hall Bio">{{cite web |year=2007 |title=The Kinks |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-kinks |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627005251/https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-kinks |archive-date=27 June 2018 |access-date=20 November 2009 |publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref><ref name="Blender">{{cite web |url=https://www.blender.com/guide/48163/kinks.html?blenderpublickey=6LcX_AgAAAAAAOmIZ3eYQ09FvLIaVVTBvUNc4zLf |title=The Kinks |publisher=Blender.com |access-date=8 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713081355/https://www.blender.com/guide/48163/kinks.html?blenderpublickey=6LcX_AgAAAAAAOmIZ3eYQ09FvLIaVVTBvUNc4zLf |archive-date=13 July 2010}}</ref> became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.<ref name="Charts Kinda">{{cite web|title=Charts And Awards|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p4690|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=20 November 2009|archive-date=4 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604120505/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p4690|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Kinks' music drew from a wide range of influences, including [[Rhythm and blues|American R&B]] and [[rock and roll]] initially, and later adopting British [[music hall]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[country music|country]]. The band gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' observational and satirical lyricism,<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen |title=The Kinks Biography on All Music.com |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p4690 |access-date=20 November 2009 |website=[[AllMusic]] |archive-date=28 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240728120313/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-kinks-mn0000100160 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Hall Bio"/><ref name="Blender"/><ref name="RollinStone">{{cite magazine |title=The Kinks Biography |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thekinks/biography |access-date=20 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621074342/https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thekinks/biography |archive-date=21 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and made apparent in albums such as ''[[Face to Face (The Kinks album)|Face to Face]]'' (1966), ''[[Something Else by the Kinks|Something Else]]'' (1967), ''[[The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society|The Village Green Preservation Society]]'' (1968), ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)|Arthur]]'' (1969), ''[[Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One|Lola Versus Powerman]]'' (1970), and ''[[Muswell Hillbillies]]'' (1971), along with their accompanying singles including the transatlantic hit "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]" (1970). After a fallow period in the mid-1970s, the band experienced a revival with their albums ''[[Sleepwalker (The Kinks album)|Sleepwalker]]'' (1977), ''[[Misfits (The Kinks album)|Misfits]]'' (1978), ''[[Low Budget (album)|Low Budget]]'' (1979), ''[[Give the People What They Want (The Kinks album)|Give the People What They Want]]'' (1981) and ''[[State of Confusion]]'' (1983), the last of which produced one of the band's most successful US hits, "[[Come Dancing (song)|Come Dancing]]".

The band's original line-up comprised Ray (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Dave (lead guitar, vocals), Quaife (bass) and [[Mick Avory]] (drums, percussion). The Davies brothers remained with the band throughout its history. Quaife briefly left the band in 1966 and was replaced by [[John Dalton (musician)|John Dalton]], though Quaife returned by the end of that year before leaving permanently in 1969, once again being replaced by Dalton. Keyboardist [[John Gosling (The Kinks musician)|John Gosling]] joined in 1970 (prior to this, session keyboardist [[Nicky Hopkins]] played on many of their recordings). After Dalton's 1976 departure, [[Andy Pyle]] briefly served as the band's bassist before being replaced by [[Argent (band)|Argent]] bassist [[Jim Rodford]] in 1978. Gosling quit in 1978 and was first replaced by ex-[[Pretty Things]] member Gordon John Edwards, then more permanently by [[Ian Gibbons (musician)|Ian Gibbons]] in 1979. Avory left the group in 1984 and was replaced by another Argent member, [[Bob Henrit]]. The band gave its last public performance in 1996 and broke up in 1997 as a result of creative tension between the Davies brothers.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=340–342}}

The Kinks have had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums in the UK,<ref name="Rogan, Johnny 2004">Rogan, Johnny (2004). passim ("Chart Positions" data)</ref> and five of their singles reached the Top 10 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Additionally, nine of their albums charted in the [[Top 40]] of the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="Disc"/> Four Kinks albums have been certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and the band has sold over 50 million records worldwide. Among numerous honours, they received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for "Outstanding Service to British Music".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=303}} In 1990, the original four members of the Kinks were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]],<ref name="Hall Bio"/><ref name="Blender"/> as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In addition, groups such as [[Van Halen]], [[the Jam]], [[the Knack]], [[the Pretenders]] and [[the Romantics]] covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, [[Britpop]] acts such as [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] cited the band as a major influence.<ref name="AllMusic" />

==History==
===Formation (1962–1963)===
[[Image:Kinks Denmark Terrace Davies.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A brown brick building. Visible is a door at left, with a bowfront window at right.|6 Denmark Terrace, the childhood home of the Davies brothers. The front room is where the family's frequent Saturday night parties were held.]]

The Davies brothers, [[Ray Davies|Ray]] and [[Dave Davies|Dave]], were born in suburban [[North London]] on Huntingdon Road, [[East Finchley]], the youngest and the only boys among their family's eight children.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=6}} Their parents, Frederick and Annie Davies, moved the family to 6{{nbsp}}Denmark Terrace, [[Fortis Green]], in the neighbouring suburb of [[Muswell Hill]].{{sfn|Kitts|2008|pp=1–3}} At home, the brothers were immersed in a world of varied musical styles, from the [[music hall]] of their parents' generation to the [[jazz]] and early [[rock and roll]] their older sisters enjoyed.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|pp=1–3}} Both Ray and his brother Dave, younger by almost three years, learned to play guitar, and they played [[skiffle]] and rock and roll together.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=6}}

The brothers attended William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later merged with [[Tollington School|Tollington Grammar School]] to become [[Fortismere School]]), where they formed a band, the Ray Davies Quartet, with Ray's friend and classmate [[Pete Quaife]] and Quaife's friend John Start (although they would also be known as the Pete Quaife Quartet if the bass player landed a gig for them instead). Their debut at a school dance was well received, which encouraged the group to play at local pubs and bars. The band went through a series of lead vocalists, including [[Rod Stewart]],{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=8–9}} another student at William Grimshaw,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ewbank |first1=Tim |first2=Stafford |last2=Hildred |title=Rod Stewart: The New Biography |year=2005 |page=7 |publisher=Portrait |isbn=978-0-74995027-9}}</ref> who performed with the group at least once in early 1962.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=8–9}} He then formed his own group, Rod Stewart and the Moonrakers, who became a local rival to the Ray Davies Quartet.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=8–9}}

In late 1962, Ray Davies left home to study at [[Hornsey College of Art]]. He pursued interests in subjects such as film, sketching, theatre, and music, including jazz and blues.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=23}} When [[Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated]] played at the college in December, he asked advice from [[Alexis Korner]], who recommended [[Giorgio Gomelsky]], the former [[Yardbirds]] manager, who put Davies in touch with the [[Soho]]-based Dave Hunt Band, a professional group of musicians who played jazz and R&B.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|pp=28–29}} A few days after the Ray Davies Quartet supported [[Cyril Stapleton]] at the [[Lyceum Ballroom]] on New Year's Eve, Davies, while still remaining in the Quartet, joined the Dave Hunt Band which briefly included [[Charlie Watts]] on drums.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=29}} In February 1963, Davies left Dave Hunt to join the Hamilton King Band (also known as the Blues Messengers), which had [[Peter Bardens]] as a pianist.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=29}} At the end of the spring term, he left Hornsey College with a view to studying film at the [[Central School of Art and Design]]. Around this time the Quartet changed their name to the Ramrods.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=30}} Davies has referred to a show the fledgling Kinks played (again as the Ray Davies Quartet) at [[Hornsey Town Hall]] on Valentine's Day 1963 as their first important gig. In June, the Hamilton King Band broke up.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=30}} However, the Ramrods kept going, performing under several other names, including the Pete Quaife Band and the Bo-Weevils, before (temporarily) settling on the Ravens.<ref name="Blender"/>{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=9–20}} The fledgling group hired two managers, Grenville Collins and Robert Wace. In late 1963 former pop singer [[Larry Page (singer)|Larry Page]] became their third manager. American record producer [[Shel Talmy]] began working with the band, and [[the Beatles]]' promoter, Arthur Howes, was retained to schedule the Ravens' live shows.{{sfn|Savage|1984|pp=15–19}} The group unsuccessfully auditioned for various record labels until early 1964, when Talmy secured them a contract with [[Pye Records]]. During this period they had acquired a new drummer, Mickey Willet; however, Willet left the band shortly before they signed to Pye.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=9–20}} The Ravens invited [[Mick Avory]] to replace him after seeing an advertisement Avory had placed in ''[[Melody Maker]]''.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=17–20}} Avory had a background in jazz drumming and had played one gig with the fledgling [[Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=17–20}}

Around this period, the Ravens decided on a new, permanent name: the Kinks. Numerous explanations of the name's genesis have been offered. In [[Jon Savage]]'s analysis, they "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage."{{sfn|Savage|1984|p=17}} Manager Robert Wace related his side of the story: "I had a friend{{nbsp}}... He thought the group was rather fun. If my memory is correct, he came up with the name just as an idea, as a good way of getting publicity{{nbsp}}... When we went to [the band members] with the name, they were{{nbsp}}... absolutely horrified. They said, 'We're not going to be called kinky!{{'"}}{{sfn|Savage|1984|p=17}} Ray Davies' account conflicts with Wace's—he recalled that the name was coined by Larry Page, and referenced their "kinky" fashion sense. Davies quoted him as saying, "The way you look, and the clothes you wear, you ought to be called the Kinks."{{sfn|Savage|1984|p=17}} "I've never really liked the name," Ray stated.{{sfn|Savage|1984|p=17}}

===Early years (1964–1965)===

[[File:The Kinks, 1964.jpg|thumb|The Kinks in their red [[Riding coat|jackets]], near [[Tower Bridge]], London, August{{nbsp}}1964]]

The Kinks' first single was a cover of the [[Little Richard]] song "[[Long Tall Sally#The Kinks version|Long Tall Sally]]". A friend of the band, [[Bobby Graham (musician)|Bobby Graham]],{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=20}} was recruited to play the drums on the recording. Graham would continue to occasionally substitute for Avory in the studio and he played on several of the Kinks' early singles, including the hits "You Really Got Me", "All Day and All of the Night" and "Tired of Waiting for You".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=20–46}} Released in February 1964, "Long Tall Sally" was almost completely ignored, despite the publicity efforts of the band's managers. When the second single "[[You Still Want Me]]" failed to chart,{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=18–22}} Pye Records threatened to annul the group's contract unless their third single was a success.{{cn|date=November 2024}}

The group opened 1965 with their first tour of Australia and New Zealand, with [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Honeycombs]].{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=47}} An intensive performing schedule saw them headline other package tours throughout the year with acts such as [[the Yardbirds]] and [[Mickey Finn (guitarist)|Mickey Finn]].{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=58}} Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between Avory and Dave Davies at the Capitol Theatre in [[Cardiff]], Wales, on 19{{nbsp}}May.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=58}}{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=55}} After finishing the first song, "You Really Got Me", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=58}}{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=55}} Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate.

Following a [[The Kinks' 1965 US tour|mid-year tour of the US]], the [[American Federation of Musicians]] refused permits for the group to appear in concerts there for the next four years, effectively cutting them off from the main market for rock music at the height of the [[British Invasion]].<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Who Let">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.kindakinks.net/misc/articles/kinksin.html |first=Loraine |last=Alterman |title=Who Let the Kinks In? |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=18 December 1969 |access-date=9 December 2016 |archive-date=20 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220104814/https://www.kindakinks.net/misc/articles/kinksin.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Although neither the Kinks nor the union revealed a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.<ref name="Who Let"/> It has been reported that the ban was sparked by an incident that happened when the band were taping [[Dick Clark]]'s TV show ''[[Where the Action Is]]'' in 1965.

Then he started making anti-British comments, such as, 'Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile thinks he can come over here and make a career for himself.{{'"}}; subsequently, a punch was thrown, and the AFM banned them.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39665367 |title=To Ray Davies, America is a 'beautiful but dangerous' place |last=Savage |first=Mark |date=23 April 2017 |work=BBC News |access-date=23 April 2017 |archive-date=23 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423062149/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-39665367 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A stopover in [[Bombay]], India, during the band's Australian and Asian tour led to Davies writing the song "[[See My Friends]]", which was released as a single in July 1965.{{sfn|Bellman|1998|p=294}} This was an early example of [[crossover music]] and one of the first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Bellman|1998|p=294}} Davies had written the song with a [[Raga rock|raga feel]] after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=241}} Music historian [[Jonathan Bellman]] argues that the song was "extremely influential" on Ray Davies' musical peers: "And while much has been made of the Beatles' '[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]' because it was the first pop record to use a [[sitar]], it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released."{{sfn|Bellman|1998|p=294}} [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] was particularly affected by the song: {{"'}}See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' That was the first reasonable use of the drone—far, far better than anything The Beatles did and far, far earlier. It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music."{{sfn|Savage|1984|p=58}} In a widely quoted{{sfn|Bellman|1998|p=294}}{{sfn|Savage|1984|p=58}}{{sfn|Bellman|1998|p=363}}	 statement by [[Barry Fantoni]], himself a 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on the Beatles: "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must get one of those.{{'"}}{{sfn|Savage|1984|p=58}} The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 10 in the UK but stalled at number 111 in the US.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=62}}

===Critical success (1966–1972)===
[[File:The Kinks 1965.png|left|thumb|Promotional photograph taken in June{{nbsp}}1965 during [[The Kinks' 1965 US tour|the band's first US tour]]]]
The satirical single "[[Sunny Afternoon]]" was the biggest UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and displacing the Beatles' "[[Paperback Writer]]".{{sfn|Rogan|1998|p=16}} Before the release of ''The Kink Kontroversy'', Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=77}} During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=77}} In June 1966, Quaife was involved in an automobile accident,{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=77}} and after his recovery he decided to leave the band. Bassist [[John Dalton (musician)|John Dalton]], who was initially hired to fill in for the injured Quaife, subsequently became his official replacement.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=89}} However, Quaife soon had a change of heart and rejoined the band in November 1966, with Dalton returning to his previous job as a coalman.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=91}}

"Sunny Afternoon" was a dry run for the band's next album ''[[Face to Face (The Kinks album)|Face to Face]]'', which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft musically gentle yet lyrically cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and [[harpsichord]]. He played on the band's next two studio albums as well and was involved in a number of their live [[BBC]] recordings before joining [[the Jeff Beck Group]] in 1968.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=77}} ''Face to Face'' was released in October 1966 in the UK, where it was well received and peaked at number 8.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=92}} When it was released in the US in December, the album was tipped as a potential "chart winner" by ''Billboard'' magazine.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=93}} Despite this, it managed only a meagre chart peak of 135—a sign of the band's flagging popularity in the American market.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=91–93}}

Released in November 1966, the Kinks' next single was a social commentary piece entitled "[[Dead End Street (song)|Dead End Street]]".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=93}} It became another UK Top 10 hit,{{sfn|Rogan|1998|p=17}} but reached only number 73 in the US.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/> Bob Dawbarn from ''Melody Maker'' praised Ray Davies' ability to create a song with "some fabulous lyrics and a marvellous melody&nbsp;... combined with a great production",{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=92}} and music scholar [[Johnny Rogan]] described it as "a [[kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink drama]] without the drama—a static vision of working-class [[stoicism]]".{{sfn|Rogan|1998|p=17}} One of the group's first promotional music videos was produced for the song. It was filmed on [[Little Green Street]], a small 18th-century lane in north London, located off Highgate Road in [[Kentish Town]].<ref name="YouTube">{{cite web|title=Dave Davies Returns to Little Green Street and talks about Dead End Street| date=7 September 2007 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ZW2YsxrIU| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211114/Q9ZW2YsxrIU| archive-date=2021-11-14 | url-status=live|publisher=DetuneTv}}{{cbignore}} Retrieved on 27 November 2009</ref> Both "Dead End Street" and its B-side "[[Big Black Smoke]]" were recorded with John Dalton on bass, though Quaife had returned by the time the single was released, and appeared in the promotional music video.{{cn|date=November 2024}}

The songs on the 1967 album, ''[[Something Else by the Kinks]]'', developed the musical progressions of ''Face to Face'', adding English [[music hall]] influences to the band's sound.<ref name="SomethingE">{{cite web|title=Something Else By The Kinks|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r42378|first=Stephen|last=Erlewine|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=27 November 2009|archive-date=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404165945/http://www.allmusic.com/album/r42378|url-status=live}}</ref> Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's "[[Death of a Clown]]". While co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, the song was also released as a Dave Davies solo single.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="SomethingE"/> Overall, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, "[[Autumn Almanac]]", in early October. Backed with "[[Mister Pleasant]]", the single became another top-5 success for the group. At this point, in a string of 13 singles, 12 of them reached the top 10 in the UK chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/11246/kinks/|title=Kinks UK Chart History|website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] |access-date=21 January 2022|archive-date=24 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124093610/https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/11246/kinks/|url-status=live}}</ref> Andy Miller suggests that, despite its success, the single marks a turning point in the band's career—it would be their last entry into the UK top ten for three years: "In retrospect, 'Autumn Almanac' marked the first hint of trouble for the Kinks. This glorious single, one of the greatest achievements of British 60s pop, was widely criticised at the time for being too similar to previous [Ray] Davies efforts."{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=15}} Nick Jones of ''Melody Maker'' asked, "Is it time that Ray stopped writing about grey suburbanites going about their fairly unemotional daily business? {{nbsp}}... Ray works to a formula, not a feeling, and it's becoming rather boring."{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=15}} Disc jockey Mike Ahern called the song "a load of old rubbish".{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=15}} Dave's second solo single "[[Susannah's Still Alive]]" was released in the UK on 24{{nbsp}}November. It sold 59,000 copies, failing to reach the top 10. Miller states that "by the end of the year, the Kinks were rapidly sliding out of fashion".{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=16}}

Beginning early in 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead focusing on studio work. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success.{{sfn|Miller|2003|pp=4–10}} The Kinks' next single, "[[Wonderboy (The Kinks song)|Wonderboy]]", released in the spring of 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK top twenty since their early covers.<ref name="Rogan 1a">Rogan, Johnny (2004). p.&nbsp;20</ref> In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called ''Village Green''.<ref name="AllMusic"/> In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was [[Peter Frampton]]'s group [[The Herd (British band)|the Herd]]. "In general, the [[teenybopper]]s were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances",{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=27}} commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward{{nbsp}}... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again."{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=27}} At the end of June, the Kinks released the single "[[Days (The Kinks song)|Days]]", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", Ray said. "I played it to Brian, who used to be our [[roadie]], and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.&nbsp;... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone."{{sfn|Savage|1984|pp=97–100}} "Days" reached number 12 in the UK and was a top-20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the US.{{sfn|Rogan|1998|p=20}}

''Village Green'' eventually morphed into their next album, ''[[The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society]]'', released in late 1968 in the UK. A collection of thematic [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] of English town and hamlet life, it was assembled from songs written and recorded over the previous two years.<ref name="VGPS1">{{cite web|title=The Village Green Preservation Society|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r11011|first=Stephen|last=Erlewine|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=27 November 2009|archive-date=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404144334/http://www.allmusic.com/album/r11011|url-status=live}}</ref> It was greeted with almost unanimously positive reviews from both UK and US rock critics, yet failed to attract strong sales.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=138}} One factor in the album's initial commercial failure was the lack of a popular single;{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=121}} it did not include the moderately successful "Days", and the album track "[[Starstruck (The Kinks song)|Starstruck]]" was released as a single in North America and continental Europe, but was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=85}}{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=121}} Although a commercial disappointment, ''Village Green'' (the project's original name was adopted as a shorthand for the long album title) was embraced by the new underground rock press when it was released in January 1969 in the US, where the Kinks began to acquire a reputation as a cult band.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=125}} In ''[[The Village Voice]]'', a newly hired [[Robert Christgau]] called it "the best album of the year so far".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=125}} The underground Boston paper ''Fusion'' published a review stating, "the Kinks continue, despite the odds, the bad press and their demonstrated lot, to come across.&nbsp;... Their persistence is dignified; their virtues are stoic. The Kinks are forever, only for now in modern dress."{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=125}} The record did not escape criticism, however. In the student paper ''California Tech'', one writer commented that it was "schmaltz rock{{nbsp}}... without imagination, poorly arranged and a poor copy of The Beatles".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=125}} Although Davies later estimated that it had sold only around 100,000&nbsp;copies worldwide on its initial release,{{sfn|Rogan|2015|p=365}} ''Village Green'' has since become the Kinks' best-selling original record.{{sfn|Miller|2003|p=138}} The album remains popular; in 2004, it was re-released in a 3CD "Deluxe" edition, and the track "[[Picture Book (song)|Picture Book]]" was featured in a popular [[Hewlett-Packard]] television commercial, helping considerably to boost the album's popularity.<ref name="Picture Book">{{cite web|title=Picture Book|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/t2739862|first=Stewart|last=Mason|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=27 November 2009|archive-date=4 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604144945/http://www.allmusic.com/song/t2739862|url-status=live}}</ref>

In early 1969, Quaife again announced that he was leaving the band.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=123}} The other members did not take his statement seriously until an article appeared in ''[[New Musical Express]]'' on 4{{nbsp}}April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=123}}{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=124}}{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=127}} Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=126}} His last recording with the Kinks was the non-album single "[[Plastic Man (song)|Plastic Man]]" and its B-side "King Kong", released in March 1969. Immediately after Quaife had confirmed he was not returning, Ray Davies called up John Dalton, who had replaced Quaife three years prior, and asked him to rejoin. Dalton remained with the group until the recording of the album ''[[Sleepwalker (The Kinks album)|Sleepwalker]]'' in 1976.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=126}}

Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=128–129}} The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=137}} Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]''.<ref name="Allmusic Arthur">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r812938|title=Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)|first=Stephen|last=Erlewine|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=27 November 2009|archive-date=24 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724073626/http://www.allmusic.com/album/r812938|url-status=live}}</ref> As with the previous two albums, ''Arthur'' was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical [[Hook (music)|hooks]].<ref name="Allmusic Arthur"/> A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics.<ref name="Charts Kinda"/><ref name="Allmusic Arthur"/> Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the [[Second World War]].<ref name="Allmusic Arthur"/>{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=131}} The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=137}} The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled.

The band added keyboardist John Gosling to their line-up in early 1970;{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=141}} before which, Nicky Hopkins and Ray Davies had done most of the session work on keyboards. In May 1970, Gosling debuted with the Kinks on "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]", an account of a confused romantic encounter with a [[transvestism|transvestite]], which became both a UK and a US top-10 hit, helping return the Kinks to the public eye.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=141}}{{sfn|Rogan|1998|pp=22–23, 76}} The lyrics originally contained the word "[[Coca-Cola]]", and the BBC refused to broadcast the song, considering it to be in violation of their policy against [[product placement]].{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=141}} Part of the song was hastily rerecorded by Ray Davies, with the offending line changed to the generic "cherry cola", although in concert the Kinks still used "Coca-Cola".{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=141}} Recordings of both versions of "Lola" exist.

==={{Anchor|Preservation}} Theatrical incarnation (1973–1976)===
In 1973, Ray Davies dived headlong into the theatrical style, beginning with the rock opera ''Preservation'', a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier ''Village Green Preservation Society'' ethos.<ref name="Preserv">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r10999 |title=Preservation Act 1 |first=Stephen |last=Erlewine |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=13 February 2010 |archive-date=4 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404151637/http://www.allmusic.com/album/r10999 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=169}} In conjunction with the ''Preservation'' project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring the group as a theatrical troupe.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Preserv"/>

=== Return to commercial success (1977–1985) ===
Following the termination of their contract with RCA, the Kinks signed with [[Arista Records]] in 1976.

The non-album single "[[Father Christmas (song)|Father Christmas]]" has remained a popular track.

Beginning in the late 1970s, bands such as the Jam ("[[David Watts (song)|David Watts]]"), the Pretenders ("[[Stop Your Sobbing]]", "[[I Go to Sleep]]"), the Romantics ("[[She's Got Everything (song)|She's Got Everything]]"), and the Knack ("[[The Hard Way (The Kinks song)|The Hard Way]]") recorded covers of Kinks songs, which helped bring attention to the group's new releases.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Hall Bio"/> In 1978, Van Halen covered "You Really Got Me" for their debut single, a top-40 US hit, helping boost the band's commercial resurgence (Van Halen later covered "[[Where Have All the Good Times Gone]]", another early Kinks song which had been covered by David Bowie on his 1973 album ''[[Pin Ups]]''). The hard rock sound of ''Low Budget'', released in 1979, helped make it the Kinks' second [[gold album]] and highest charting original album in the US, where it peaked at number 11.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Hall Bio"/><ref name="Charts Kinda"/> The live album ''[[One for the Road (The Kinks album)|One for the Road]]'' was produced in 1980, along with a video of the same title, bringing the group's concert-drawing power to a peak that would last into 1983.<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Hall Bio"/> Dave Davies also took advantage of the group's improved commercial standing to fulfil his decade-long ambitions to release albums of his solo work. The first was the [[eponym]]ous ''Dave Davies'' in 1980. It was also known by its catalogue number "[[AFL1-3603]]" because of its cover art, which depicted Dave Davies as a leather-jacketed piece of price-scanning barcode.

The band's profile rose considerably in the mid-1990s, primarily as a result of the "[[Britpop]]" boom.<ref name="AllMusic"/>{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=340}} Several of the most prominent bands of the decade cited the Kinks as a major influence.

Kinks chronicler and historian Doug Hinman stated, "The symbolism of the event was impossible to overlook. The party was held at the site of the brothers' very first musical endeavour, the Clissold Arms pub, across the street from their childhood home on Fortis Green in North London."{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=337}}

In March 2023, Avory laid to rest rumours of a reunion, citing differences between the Davies brothers: "I don't think it's possible now – one thing, health-wise.

==Live performances==
The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964.<ref name="Blender"/>{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=9–20}} Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born.{{cn|date=November 2024}}

The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a "package" bill that included [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Honeycombs]].{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=47}} They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as [[the Yardbirds]] and [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]].{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=58}} Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, [[Cardiff]], Wales on 19 May.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=58}}{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=55}} After finishing the first song, "You Really Got Me", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=58}}{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=55}} Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16&nbsp;stitches to his head.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=58}}{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=55}} To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.{{sfn|Kitts|2008|p=58}}{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=55}} Following their summer 1965 American tour, the [[American Federation of Musicians]] refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the US for the next four years,<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Who Let"/> possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.<ref>Crouse, Timothy. ''The British Scourge''. ''Show Guide'' Magazine, 1969.</ref>

In April 1969, Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians ban on the group,{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=128–129}} which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was "sick of it all" at a gig in [[White City Stadium]], London, in 1973.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=173}} A review of the concert published in ''Melody Maker'' stated: "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F......{{sic}} sick of the whole thing'&nbsp;... He was 'Sick up to here with it'&nbsp;... and those that heard shook their heads. Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer{{sic}} on through 'Waterloo Sunset.{{'"}}<ref name="Days"/> Davies proceeded to try to announce that the Kinks were breaking up as the band were leaving the stage, but this attempt was foiled by the group's publicity management, who pulled the plug on the microphone system.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=173}}<ref name="Days"/>

==Musical style==
According to Jeff Mezydlo of [[Yardbarker]], the Kinks combined the "[[Pop rock|pop-rock]] feel of the [[British Invasion|British invasion]] with a [[Blues|bluesy]] tint."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-01-28 |title=The 25 most legendary bands to hail from England |url=https://www.yardbarker.com/entertainment/articles/the_25_greatest_english_rock_bands/s1__30317819#slide_20 |access-date=2025-02-10 |website=Yardbarker |language=en}}</ref> The band started out playing the then popular R&B and [[blues]] styles; then, under the influence of [[the Kingsmen]]'s "[[Louie Louie]]" recording, developed louder rock and hard rock sounds.

From 1966 onwards,<ref name="AllMusic"/> the Kinks came to be known for their adherence to traditions of [[Music of the United Kingdom|English music]] and [[Culture of England|culture]], during a period when many other British bands dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R&B and pop styles.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965, he decided to break away from the American scene and write more introspective and intelligent songs. "I decided I was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote '[[A Well Respected Man]]'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote{{nbsp}}... [I also] abandoned any attempt to Americanise my [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]."{{sfn|Hinman|2004|p=61}} The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the [[American Federation of Musicians]]. The ban cut them off from the American record-buying public, the world's largest musical market,<ref name="AllMusic"/> forcing them to focus on Britain and [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]]. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, incorporating elements of [[music hall]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[baroque music]] through use of [[harpsichord]], acoustic guitar, [[Mellotron]], and [[horn instrument|horns]], in albums such as ''Face to Face'', ''Something Else by the Kinks'', ''The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society'', and ''Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)'', creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

Beginning with ''Everybody's in Show-biz'' (1972), Ray Davies began exploring theatrical concepts on the group's albums; these themes became manifest on the 1973 album ''Preservation Act 1'' and continued through ''Schoolboys in Disgrace'' (1976).<ref name="AllMusic"/> The Kinks were less commercially successful with these conceptual works and were dropped by [[RCA]], which had signed them in 1971. In 1977, they moved to Arista Records, which insisted on a more traditional rock format. ''Sleepwalker'' (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm.<ref name="Sleepwalker"/> The band returned to hard rock for ''Low Budget'' (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career,<ref name="AllMusic"/> combining this with pop music in the 1980s with albums such as ''[[Give the People What They Want (The Kinks album)|Give the People What They Want]]'' and songs such as "[[Better Things (The Kinks song)|Better Things]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.americansongwriter.com/2011/06/the-30-day-song-selection-spectacular-4-favorite-breakup-song/ |title=The 30-Day Song Selection Spectacular: #4, Favorite Breakup Song |first=Paula |last=Carino |date=2011 |website=American Songwriter |access-date=16 June 2020 |archive-date=6 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806141359/https://americansongwriter.com/2011/06/the-30-day-song-selection-spectacular-4-favorite-breakup-song/ |url-status=live}}</ref>
