==Biography==
[[File:Steve Vai Zepparella 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Steve Vai in 2017]]
===Early life===
Steve Vai, a descendant of [[Italian Americans|Italian immigrants]], was born in [[Carle Place, New York]] on June 6, 1960. He is the fourth son of John and Theresa Vai.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai: the 10 Records That Changed My Life|url = http://www.teamrock.com/features/2015-12-15/steve-vai-the-10-records-that-changed-my-life|website = TeamRock|date = 2015-12-15|access-date = 2016-01-10|language = en-GB|first = Joe|last = Bosso|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160128114634/http://www.teamrock.com/features/2015-12-15/steve-vai-the-10-records-that-changed-my-life|archive-date = January 28, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Vai was raised [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=di Perna|first=Alan|date=June 29, 2009|title=Steve Vai: Flex Appeal|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/features/steve-vai-flex-appeal|access-date=May 1, 2022|publisher=Guitar World|language=en-US}}</ref> He described his first experiences with music as, "at the age of five I walked up to [a] piano, hit a note, and noticed that to the right the notes go higher and to the left the notes go lower. In that very moment, I had a full-on epiphany. I was flooded with the instinctual realization of how music was created and how it worked from a theoretical standpoint—the whole language of music was very obvious. I also understood immediately, instinctually, and unequivocally something that has only deepened through the years: that the creation of music is an infinite personal expression. I realized that I could do this, I could make music, and it could be whatever I want."<ref name="http://facebook.com/MakeWeirdMusic">{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Interview · Make Weird Music|url = http://www.makeweirdmusic.com/interview/steve-vai/|website = Make Weird Music|publisher = MakeWeirdMusic|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.makeweirdmusic.com/interview/steve-vai/|archive-date = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Musician's Friend Exclusive Interview with Steve Vai, Part I Buyer's Guide {{!}} Musicians Friend|url = http://www.musiciansfriend.com/resources/article/Musicians-Friend-Exclusive-Interview-with-Steve-Vai-Part-I/m710806|website =Musiciansfriend.com|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151226081151/http://www.musiciansfriend.com/resources/article/Musicians-Friend-Exclusive-Interview-with-Steve-Vai-Part-I/m710806|archive-date = December 26, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="americansongwriter.com">{{Cite web|title = Q&A: Steve Vai Drops Some Knowledge « American Songwriter|url = http://americansongwriter.com/2012/10/qa-steve-vai-drops-some-knowledge/|website = American Songwriter| date=October 2012 |access-date = 2015-12-28|language = en-US|url-status = live|archive-url = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151230223246/http://americansongwriter.com/2012/10/qa-steve-vai-drops-some-knowledge/|archive-date = December 30, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

It was a year later, at the age of six, that Vai experienced his first introduction to the guitar, remembering that, "I saw this nine-year-old boy playing the guitar in my grade school auditorium, and that was another epiphany that I had. It was my first recognition of the instrument. When I saw that guitar and I saw this kid playing it, I knew instinctually that I was going to play the guitar someday, and that it would be my instrument. Don't ask me how I knew, I just knew. It was the coolest thing I had ever seen."<ref name="http://facebook.com/MakeWeirdMusic"/><ref name="americansongwriter.com"/>

As a young child, Vai was influenced by the music his parents had listened to. One album in particular that he cites as his "musical awakening" was the original motion picture soundtrack to the 1961 film ''[[West Side Story (1961 soundtrack)|West Side Story]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Record that Changed My Life: Steve Vai Discusses 'West Side Story: Original Broadway Cast Recording'|url = http://www.guitarworld.com/record-changed-my-life-steve-vai-discusses-west-side-story-original-broadway-cast-recording|website = Guitar World|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105121231/http://www.guitarworld.com/record-changed-my-life-steve-vai-discusses-west-side-story-original-broadway-cast-recording|archive-date = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> At age eleven, Vai was introduced to the contemporary rock and [[progressive rock|progressive]] music of the era, and after hearing the guitar solo to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]]" at age twelve, decided to begin playing the guitar.

In 1973, Vai began to take guitar lessons from fellow New York native [[Joe Satriani]], and played in local bands (The Ohio Express, Circus, and Rayge) throughout his high school years.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 10 Things You Didn't Know About Steve Vai|url = http://ultimateclassicrock.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-steve-vai/|website = Ultimate Classic Rock| date=June 6, 2011 |access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225080806/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-steve-vai/|archive-date = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> He spoke of when his friend John Sergio gave him Joe Satriani's number to Steve for him and his friend Frankie Munn to get guitar lessons.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Instagram |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/C2TX3qGOCYC/?hl=en |access-date=2024-02-12 |website=Instagram.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Vai.com > Discography > Disc Notes - At The Door |url=https://www.vai.com/AllAboutSteve/disconotes_heresy.html |access-date=2024-02-12 |website=Vai.com}}</ref> In 1978, to further pursue his interest in music composition and theory, Vai attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] after graduating from [[Carle Place High School]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=di Perna |title=Steve Vai and Joe Satriani Discuss Influences and Long Island Roots in 1990 Guitar World Interview |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/gw-archive/steve-vai-and-joe-satriani-discuss-influences-and-long-island-roots-1990-guitar-world-interview |access-date=7 September 2022 |publisher=Guitar World |date=October 4, 2011}}</ref> While at Berklee, Vai began working for [[Frank Zappa]] as a transcriptionist, and in the middle of his fourth semester, moved to California to start his career as a session and touring artist for Zappa.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Berklee Press: An Interview with Steve Vai|url = http://www.berkleepress.com/newsletter/steve_vai.htm|website =Berkleepress.com|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150901080843/http://www.berkleepress.com/newsletter/steve_vai.htm|archive-date = September 1, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Also while at Berklee, Vai met his future spouse [[Pia Maiocco]].

Vai was a featured artist on the 1993 release ''[[Zappa's Universe]]'', and in 2006, Vai appeared as a special guest on [[Dweezil Zappa]]'s [[Zappa Plays Zappa]] tour; both projects won Vai a [[Grammy Award]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Awards|publisher = vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/awards/|access-date = 2015-12-22|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225095812/http://www.vai.com/awards/|archive-date = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

After moving on from Zappa's employ in 1983, Vai bought a house in [[Sylmar, Los Angeles]], where he built his first professional studio.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Studios - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/the-studios/|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2015-12-22|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227025257/http://www.vai.com/the-studios/|archive-date = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> During this period, Vai formed two bands (The Classified and 777)<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bands - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/bands/|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2015-12-22|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227041625/http://www.vai.com/bands/|archive-date = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> as well as writing and recording a large amount of music that was not originally intended for release. Out of this material, Vai compiled his first studio album ''[[Flex-Able]]''. He created his own record label, [[Akashic records|Akashic Records]] (later Light Without Heat Records), which he used to take ''Flex-Able'' directly to distribution channels.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Vai.com - The Official Steve Vai Website: Disc Notes - Flex-Able|url = http://www.vai.com/AllAboutSteve/disconotes_flexable.html|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2015-12-22|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051804/http://www.vai.com/AllAboutSteve/disconotes_flexable.html|archive-date = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> ''Flex-Able'' was released in January 1984.

Vai began his rise to public acclaim in 1983 when, shortly before the release of ''Flex-Able'', his composition "[[The Attitude Song]]" was published in ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine.<ref name="Play Like Steve Vai"/> The song centered itself on a main guitar riff in the [[time signature]] 7/16, played over a rhythm section centered in 4/4. Each following section of the song showcased a number of specialized techniques (such as [[tapping#Two-handed tapping|two-handed tapping]], [[whammy bar|whammy bar acrobatics]], [[sweep-picking|sweep picking]], [[alternate picking]], [[harmony|multi-part harmonies]], and odd [[phrase (music)|phrasing]]) used in angular and exaggerated ways that were unique to the song at the time.<ref name="Play Like Steve Vai"/> Interest from the public grew even greater when Vai's song "Blue Powder" (a demonstration for the [[Carvin Corporation|Carvin]] X100b [[guitar amplifier|amplifier]]) was published in ''Guitar Player'' as well, which showed the virtuoso side of Vai's compositional process. Also in 1986, Vai was cast in the film ''[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]'' as the Devil's guitar player "Jack Butler". In the famous "duel scene" between Vai and [[Ralph Macchio]]'s character, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts with the exception of the slide guitar, which was performed by [[Ry Cooder]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090888/soundtrack|title = Crossroads (1986)|publisher = IMDb|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090888/soundtrack|archive-date = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

In between solo work, Vai replaced [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] in June 1984 as the lead guitarist of [[Alcatrazz]], with whom he recorded the album ''[[Disturbing the Peace (album)|Disturbing the Peace]]''. Vai left shortly after the subsequent tour to join [[David Lee Roth]]'s band.

===With David Lee Roth (1985–1989)===
In 1985, Vai joined David Lee Roth's post-[[Van Halen]] band as [[lead guitar]]ist, together with former [[Talas (band)|Talas]] bassist [[Billy Sheehan]] on bass; and former [[Maynard Ferguson]] drummer [[Gregg Bissonette]] on drums. The quartet’s debut album ''[[Eat 'Em and Smile]]'', released on July 7, 1986, was both a critical and commercial success, reaching number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart and selling over two million copies.

[[Image:Steve-Vai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vai performing in 2004]]
While most widely recognized for his stature as a rock guitar player, Vai is also a musical composer fluent in the composition and arranging of [[orchestra]]l music. In May 2004, Vai premiered "The Aching Hunger", a project commissioned by the Netherlands Programme Service and performed with the Netherlands' [[Metropole Orkest|Metropole Orchestra]]. "The Aching Hunger" performances consisted of two parts: the first showcasing Vai's original contemporary orchestral compositions, and the second consisting of Vai (on guitar) playing newly arranged material from his catalog with the orchestra.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Vai.com - The Official Steve Vai Website > Inside Real Illusions: Reflections|url = http://www.vai.com/minisites/realillusions/07lotusfeet.html|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2015-12-27|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175927/http://www.vai.com/minisites/realillusions/07lotusfeet.html|archive-date = March 3, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> This project yielded both the ''[[Visual Sound Theories]]'' DVD and the ''[[Sound Theories Vol. I & II]]'' album, which were recorded in 2005 during multiple "Aching Hunger" performances and released in June 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sound Theories, Vols. 1-2 - Steve Vai {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/sound-theories-vols-1-2-mw0000470643|website = AllMusic|access-date = 2015-12-27|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.allmusic.com/album/sound-theories-vols-1-2-mw0000470643|archive-date = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> While "The Aching Hunger" and its following releases started Vai's public career as an orchestral composer, Vai had been composing since he began a music theory class (taught by Bill Westcott) in high school. While reflecting on his time with Westcott, Vai said "He taught me how to write, compose and appreciate music. There was no greater musical influence in my life."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bill Westcott - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/bill-westcott-3/|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2015-12-27|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227123126/http://www.vai.com/bill-westcott-3/|archive-date = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2005, Vai released ''[[Real Illusions: Reflections]]'', the first installment in an ongoing three-part trilogy concept album. Each of the three installments to the series contain material (songs, lyrics, and both spoken and written narration) with particular relationships to the storyline, purposefully left out of order.

It's a story about this man who has a traumatic experience in his life, and it drives him insane. We see the story through his eyes. It also involves the town he lives in and this stranger that enters the town who's like a shaman; he builds this giant edifice, like a reflecting pond, and when people come to it they see aspects of their personalities and identities and discover things about themselves.

In 2006, Vai joined the [[Zappa Plays Zappa]] tour as a special guest, alongside additional Zappa band alumni Terry Bozzio and [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]]. In 2008, for his performance of "Peaches en Regalia" from the Zappa Plays Zappa tour, Vai won his third [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Having always enjoyed the aspect of teaching and sharing his experiences in life and in the music business,{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}} Vai began a series of "Alien Guitar Secrets" masterclasses in 2006- a touring masterclass in which Vai holds open forum discussion about his own experiences in the music industry, explains the key principles to understanding success, plays to backing tracks (often inviting class attendees to jam with him), answers questions, articulates key points of guitar technique, and more importantly goes beyond the technique and into the more profound esoteric principles at play (see Notable contributions for more on this).

In support of ''Sound Theories Vol. I & II'' and ''Visual Sound Theories'', Vai put together a new band for a five-month world tour of the United States, Europe, South America, and Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Unveils New Band String Theories|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/steve-vai-unveils-new-band-string-theories/|website = Blabbermouth.net|date = 2007-05-23|access-date = 2015-12-27|language = en-US|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105070447/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/steve-vai-unveils-new-band-string-theories/|archive-date = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> While evaluating unique options for the band (which included ideas for a [[horn (instrument)|horn]] section or [[percussion instrument|percussion]] section), Vai began auditioning violin players to complement the new lineup. This new band, known as the String Theories band, featured previous The Breed members Jeremy Colson (drums) and Dave Weiner (guitar and sitar), along with new members [[Bryan Beller]] (bass), Alex DePue (violin), and [[Ann Marie Calhoun]] (violin). During a month of twelve- to fifteen-hour a day rehearsals, Vai and the band perfected the performance (which consisted of pieces from Vai's catalog, arranged by Vai to include the two violins).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Unveils New Band String Theories|url = http://bravewords.com/news/steve-vai-unveils-new-band-string-theories|website = bravewords.com| date=May 23, 2007 |access-date = 2015-12-27|language = en-US|url-status = live|archive-url = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151229111646/http://bravewords.com/news/steve-vai-unveils-new-band-string-theories|archive-date = December 29, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The tour began in June 2007 and ended in December the same year.

An independent film, ''Crazy'' was inspired by the life and music of the guitarist [[Hank Garland]].<ref>{{Cite web |url =https://www.guitar.com/articles/favored-nations-release-crazy |title =Favored Nations- Crazy |url-status =dead |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160105170853/https://www.guitar.com/articles/favored-nations-release-crazy |archive-date =January 5, 2016|df =mdy-all}}</ref>

==Style and influence==
At the age of thirteen, after having purchased his first guitar and begun taking his first lessons from fellow New York native [[Joe Satriani]], Vai became obsessed with the discipline of practice. Vai's practice routine, consisting of a rigid and structured regimen of ten-to-fifteen hour-a-day practice schedules, became the basis of his work ethic for the rest of his career.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Play Like Steve Vai|url = http://www.guitarplayer.com/artists/1026/10-things-you-gotta-do-to-play-like-steve-vai/21995 |website =Guitarplayer.com |access-date = 2015-12-28 |url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222090709/http://www.guitarplayer.com/artists/1026/10-things-you-gotta-do-to-play-like-steve-vai/21995 |archive-date = December 22, 2015 |df = mdy-all}}</ref> During his employment by [[Frank Zappa]], Vai transcribed and played very rhythmically complex music, believing that if started slow and perfected, any piece of music could be played.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tempo Mental - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/tempo-mental/|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227045132/http://www.vai.com/tempo-mental/|archive-date = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

Vai's first solo album, ''[[Flex-Able]]'', began his career as a solo artist in 1984. During the period of time that the album was recorded, Vai was heavily influenced by his previous tenure in [[Frank Zappa]]'s band.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Album – Flex-Able - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/album-flex-able/|website = Vai.com|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225151341/http://www.vai.com/album-flex-able/|archive-date = December 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Originally not intended for release, ''Flex-Able'' expressed a certain creative "quirky" and "angular" freedom in the eclectic nature of Vai's writing style.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Flex-Able - Steve Vai {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/flex-able-mw0000196197|website = AllMusic|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160124042303/http://www.allmusic.com/album/flex-able-mw0000196197|archive-date = January 24, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> ''[[Passion and Warfare]]'', Vai's second solo album, expressed a more mature and evolved "signature" style but retained a certain freedom of unfettered inspiration that would continue to influence Vai's future releases.<ref name="auto1"/> In speaking of his inspiration, Vai has said that it comes to him in many forms (even from the flowers pushed up against a fence outside of his studio, which he transcribed and used in the ninth track "Weeping China Doll", from ''[[The Story of Light (Steve Vai album)|The Story of Light]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Vai.com > Naked Tracks > Volumes VI & VII (Naked Tracks)|url = http://www.vai.com/minisites/nakedtracks/nakedtracks_vol67.html|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151028224906/http://www.vai.com/minisites/nakedtracks/nakedtracks_vol67.html|archive-date = October 28, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> While expressing that he is not continuously inspired, Vai uses a concept he calls "musical meditation" to enter a state of consciousness that he calls "The Ultra Zone".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Part Two - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/part-two/|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.vai.com/part-two/|archive-date = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> When inside this un-critical frame of mind, Vai is able to achieve inspiration in the form of musical ideas (often in forms of melody or rhythm).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Martian Love Secrets - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/martian-love-secrets/|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227045543/http://www.vai.com/martian-love-secrets/|archive-date = December 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> For these moments of inspiration, Vai created what he calls the "Infinity Shelf", a drive of thousands of snippets of song ideas that he has collected over his entire career.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web|title = Steve Vai Opens His Vaults for VaiTunes Series|url = http://www.guitarworld.com/steve-vai-opens-his-vaults-vaitunes-series|website = Guitar World|access-date = 2015-12-28|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105103715/http://www.guitarworld.com/steve-vai-opens-his-vaults-vaitunes-series|archive-date = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> These [[esoteric]] principles are taught by Vai during his Alien Guitar Secrets masterclasses, among a host of other information.

==Notable contributions==
===Work with Frank Zappa===
As a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, Vai transcribed some of Zappa's most rhythmically complex music, using a range of conceptualizations for the notation of rhythmic music. Vai says "While transcribing the material, I was often confronted with situations that led me to reach into the intuitional areas of my imagination to come up with various notational devices and constructions that I had never seen before. I soon discovered that many contemporary composers were then (and are still) using these notations". These concepts can be seen throughout the "Frank Zappa Guitar Book", which were composed of Vai's guitar and drum transcriptions from various Zappa albums. Vai toured with Zappa from 1980 to 1983, performing selections of this technically demanding music with Zappa's band at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Tempo Mental - vai.com – The Official Steve Vai Website|url = http://www.vai.com/tempo-mental/|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2016-01-08|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105123103/http://www.vai.com/tempo-mental/|archive-date = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

===JEM, PIA, and Universe guitars===
Vai designed the [[Ibanez JEM]] guitar, a unique instrument that incorporated a series of groundbreaking designs that have since become staples in feature throughout the guitar industry, in 1985. In speaking of the development of the guitar, Vai says, "[[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocasters]] had [[Vibrato systems for guitar|whammy bars]]—which were fantastic—but they were very limited, were always going out of tune, and had [[Single coil guitar pickup|single-coil pickups]]. [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Pauls]] had [[humbucker]]s—which gave you that real scream in the bridge position—but no whammy bar, and I didn't like the way they sat. Neither guitar had twenty-four [[fret]]s. So I went to a guitar shop in Hollywood, where I had these elements implemented into a guitar (what would have been considered a [[Superstrat]] at the time). The guitar was designed with a sharper body shape, a large cutaway around the neck, twenty-four frets, a fully floating tremolo system, a specially wired five-way pickup selector switch, and an output jack angled on the side of the body (so that when you step on the cable, it doesn't pull out of your guitar). I knew of course that these features would eventually be taken and used in other guitars, so I did something completely preposterous: I said, 'Put a handle in it!' That way, during videos and photoshoots I could swing the guitar around."<ref name="guitarworld.com"/>

Vai had several custom prototypes of these guitars built (which were used on the ''Eat 'Em and Smile'' tour) by Joe "Jem" Despagni, a custom guitar luthier and friend of Vai's. Due to Vai's highly coveted position in Roth's band, many guitar companies were eager to propose endorsement opportunities. In response to these offers, Vai sent out the specifications of the JEM guitar, detailing that the company that returned the best guitar would be given the endorsement. Dissatisfied with the guitars returned and unwilling to compromise, Vai held out on a guitar endorsement until [[Ibanez]] approached him, sending him an instrument superior to that of the other companies and willing to follow his instructions. After the pre-production prototypes were perfected, the first production Ibanez JEM 777 guitars were unveiled at the [[NAMM Show]] in 1987. Since its original 1987 release, the JEM has become one of the longest-running and most successful signature series guitars in history, with its sister guitar, the [[Ibanez RG]], being the second highest-selling guitar (behind the [[Fender Stratocaster]]) on the market.

Another design by Vai was the [[Ibanez Universe]], the first production [[seven-string guitar]], which was released in 1989. The Universe incorporated many of the aspects that made the JEM a unique instrument (2 octave fretboard, full floating tremolo, [[humbucker]]/[[single coil]]/[[humbucker]] pickup configuration, angled output jack and deeper body cutaways), with an added low 'B' string, allowing for new low-range sonic possibilities. Used by Vai on much of ''Passion and Warfare'' and all of Whitesnake's ''Slip of the Tongue'', the Universe was a large stepping stone for the burgeoning [[Nu metal|Nu-metal]] genre (with bands such as [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Fear Factory]] and [[Meshuggah]] having adopted the instrument and incorporating it into their signature sound).

On April 4 of 2020 the Ibanez PIA was introduced, which Vai says is the modernisation and maturing of his original JEM.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Features|url=https://www.guitarinteractivemagazine.com/features/steve-vai-interview/|access-date=2021-03-10|website=Guitar Interactive Magazine|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=February 2020|first=Richard Bienstock 28|title=Steve Vai goes in-depth on his stunning new signature model, the Ibanez PIA: "It's a guitar built for freakdom"|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/features/steve-vai-goes-in-depth-on-his-stunning-new-signature-model-the-ibanez-pia-its-a-guitar-built-for-freakdom|access-date=2021-03-10|website=guitarworld|date=February 28, 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The PIA model (named after his wife Pia Maiocco), features an alder body and a 5-piece maple / walnut neck with 24 frets, rosewood fretboard with the usual floral inlays. The neck is styled in the classic Ibanez wizard III neck - 430mmR neck radius. The primary way model differs from the JEM for its softer body curves and a Petal Grip handle replacing the original Monkey Grip cutout. It also sports [[DiMarzio]] UtoPIA pickups in an HSH configuration, gold hardware and a Prestige locking vibrato unit.<ref>{{cite web |title=NAMM 2020: Ibanez releases striking Steve Vai PIA Signature |url=https://guitar.com/news/ibanez-steve-vai-pia-signature-namm-2020/ |website=Guitar.com |date=January 16, 2020 |access-date=9 February 2020}}</ref>

===Alien Guitar Secrets masterclasses===
Having always enjoyed the aspect of teaching and sharing his experiences in life and in the music business, Vai began a series of "Alien Guitar Secrets" masterclasses in 2006- a touring masterclass in which Vai holds open forum discussion about his own experiences in the music industry, explains the key principles to understanding success, plays to backing tracks (often inviting class attendees to jam with him), answers questions, articulates key points of guitar technique, and more importantly goes beyond the technique and into the more profound esoteric principles at play. Vai details certain concepts he has discovered that have helped him in all areas of his life and career, both in playing guitar/ musically as well as spiritually. Vai accessibly shares these concepts with masterclass participants using examples from his own experiences, delving into the ongoing process of identifying the self-critical nature of one's own thoughts. Vai explains the techniques and exercises he uses to circumnavigate one's own insecurities and thoughts of self-doubt, and encourages masterclass participants to use these tools in their own lives. Often embarking on masterclass tours through Europe, South America, and Russia, Vai considers this ongoing series of classes as one of his most important contributions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = - Alien Guitar Secrets|url = http://www.alienguitarsecrets.com|website =Alienguitarsecrets.com|access-date = 2016-01-08|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160107105640/http://www.alienguitarsecrets.com/|archive-date = January 7, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Steve Talks about the new DVD and more|url = http://www.vai.com/minisites/wtwta/|website =Vai.com|access-date = 2016-01-09|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052241/http://www.vai.com/minisites/wtwta/|archive-date = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

===Eventide H3000 Ultra-Harmonizer===
Guitar effects manufacturer [[Eventide, Inc|Eventide]] approached Vai in the mid-1980s to contribute unique ideas for their H3000 effects unit. Vai suggested many specific concepts, such as diatonic pitch change and multi-voice harmony, that were used in the unit and have since become standard algorithms in guitar effects processors.<ref>{{Cite web|title = H3000 Factory {{!}} Eventide|url = https://www.eventideaudio.com/products/plugins/pitch-delay-modulation-filtering/h3000-factory|website=Eventideaudio.com|access-date = 2016-01-07|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160208063159/https://www.eventideaudio.com/products/plugins/pitch-delay-modulation-filtering/h3000-factory|archive-date = February 8, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

===DiMarzio pickups===

Before his endorsement with Ibanez, Vai was endorsed by [[Charvel]] guitars, most notably using a green and black San Dimas model. In addition, over the course of his career, Vai has used guitars made by various other companies, including [[Jackson Guitars|Jackson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], and Gavtone.

Vai's preferred string gauge has usually been 9-42 [[Ernie Ball Inc.|Ernie Ball Strings]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Ernie Ball: String Theory featuring Steve Vai | date=April 10, 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5caGv0ajsl8 |access-date=2024-02-12 |language=en}}</ref>

===Guitar rig and signal flow===
Vai's 2016 live guitar rig utilizes his signature Carvin Legacy amplifier (now on its third version), the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx II XL, and an MFC-101 foot controller.

Depending on the location and venue, Vai will use either his Legacy I or Legacy III heads, and Carvin Legacy 4x12 speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses EL-34 tubes by Groove Tubes in his Legacy amps.

Vai uses the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx II XL as the only modulation effects unit in his guitar rig. Generally for live use he utilizes the unit for stereo effects such as [[delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[chorus effect|chorus]], and [[phaser (effect)|phase]], with a separate preset for the parameters of each different song in his setlist. The Axe-Fx MFC-101 foot controller is set up in conjunction with the unit, allowing Vai to switch effects on and off in a fashion reminiscent to that of standard stompboxes.

Vai's pedalboard consists of a [[wah-wah pedal]] (either his Morley Bad Horsie signature pedal, or a [[Dunlop Cry Baby]] 95q), an Ibanez Jemini twin [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedal, and [[DigiTech Whammy]] DT pitch shifting pedal. The centerpiece of the pedalboard is the Axe-Fx MFC-101 foot controller for the Axe-Fx II XL, which, as previously mentioned, controls the effects in a manner similar to switching on and off stompboxes. There are two expression pedals used for the Axe-Fx, one to act as a [[expression pedal|volume pedal]], and the other to control the [[pitch shift|harmonizer]] built into the Axe-Fx unit.

The signal from the guitar (usually one of the main guitars "EVO", "FLO III" or more recently, "ONYX") goes into either the Morley Bad Horsie or Dunlop 95q wah pedal. From there, it goes directly into the Ibanez Jemini twin distortion pedal, and then to the Digitech Whammy DT. From the output of the Whammy, the signal heads into the input of the Carvin Legacy amplifier head. Out of the effects loop of the Legacy, the signal heads directly into the Axe-Fx II XL, where it is split into stereo and the effects are applied (and controlled via the MFC-101 foot controller). Out of the output of the Axe-Fx, one signal is sent back to the original Legacy head return, and a second is sent to a second Carvin Legacy head return, bypassing the [[preamplifier|preamp]] stage completely and acting as a slave [[audio power amplifier|power amp]]. Vai utilizes his stereo setup on effects like delay, where he sets up two separate delay times (one slower and one faster) and allows them to alternate back and forth. The signal is then sent from the amp to the 4x12 Carvin Legacy speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses [[AKG Acoustics|AKG]] microphones to mic his amps, and uses a separate Carvin power amp to power a direct guitar monitor cabinet instead of relying on the [[public address system|PA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rig Rundown - Steve Vai|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Rig_Rundown_Steve_Vai|website=Premier Guitar|date=August 8, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722172306/http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Rig_Rundown_Steve_Vai|archive-date=July 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
