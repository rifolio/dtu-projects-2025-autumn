'''Ghost''' is a Swedish [[Rock music|rock]] band known for combining costumed theatricality, [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[arena rock]]. Formed in [[Linköping]] in 2006, the band released their debut album, ''[[Opus Eponymous]]'' in 2010, which earned them international recognition. This was followed by ''[[Infestissumam]]'' in 2013 and in 2015 by ''[[Meliora (album)|Meliora]]'', which reached number one in Sweden and number eight in the US. This was followed by the albums ''[[Prequelle]]'' in 2018 and ''[[Impera]]'' in 2022. The band's sixth studio album, ''[[Skeletá]]'', was released in 2025; it subsequently became their first number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.

Known for their costumed on-stage presence, Ghost's members, except for the lead vocalist, are known as "Nameless Ghouls". The lead-singer has performed under the persona of "Papa Emeritus", a character known for its "demonic anti-pope" imagery, while changing this for subsequent tours.

In 2017, the identity of the lead singer was revealed to be [[Tobias Forge]] after several musicians who had worked with him on the Ghost project started legal action over royalties. The single, "[[Cirice]]", earned the band a [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] in 2016, while they have been nominated for several Swedish [[Grammis]] awards.

Ghost's Satanic theme has proven problematic for the group, especially in the US.

Chicago heavy metal-themed restaurant [[Kuma's Corner]] added a hamburger called "The Ghost" to its menu in tribute to Ghost. Its recipe includes goat shoulder, red wine reduction, and a communion wafer. A local Catholic food blogger acknowledged that while the unconsecrated wafer is not the [[Eucharist]], it is still symbolic, and that "it is a mockery of something that is holy". The restaurant's owner acknowledged the controversy and stated they respected religion while refusing to remove the burger, citing the [[First Amendment]]. To demonstrate his respect for opposing views, he also donated $1,500 to Catholic Charities of the Chicago Archdiocese.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Chris|last=Martins|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/10/ghost-bc-burger-communion-wine-wafer-christ-kumas/|title=Ghost B.C.

The group's vocalist usually portrays the band's mascot character, a Satanic priest known as Papa Emeritus.<ref name="sfwinterview"/> There have been four different characters taking the name Papa Emeritus. They first welcomed the second Papa Emeritus on 12 December 2012, in Linköping. On 3 June 2015, the second Papa Emeritus welcomed his younger brother as the new Papa Emeritus in Linköping after being "fired" due to not performing his duty in overthrowing governments and churches. Papa Emeritus II and Papa Emeritus III were stated to only have a 3-month difference in age. On 30 September 2017 during a show in [[Gothenburg]], Papa Emeritus III was dragged off stage by two men, who then escorted a new character, Papa Emeritus 0, to the stage to introduce the band's next chapter. Papa Emeritus 0 is portrayed as being significantly older than the previous Papas, making use of a walker and oxygen tank whilst walking on stage. On 19 January 2018, the band shared a video that features a character, implied to be Papa Emeritus IV, listening to ''Ceremony and Devotion'' on [[8-track tape]] while critiquing Papa Emeritus III's vocal abilities. The character's face is hidden offscreen, but he is shown to wear red vestments similar to a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal priest]].

Peter Hällje, a former bandmate of former Ghost member Martin Persner, claimed he designed the Papa Emeritus character in 2005, prior to the formation of Ghost. Hällje never performed as Papa Emeritus and agreed with Persner to let him use the character for his then-new band. His claim was later confirmed by Forge.<ref name="forgestatement"/>

=== Cardinal Copia ===
[[File:Ghost - Wacken Open Air 2018-4856.jpg|thumb|right|Cardinal Copia performing in 2018]]
In April 2018, it was revealed that the "new leader" of Ghost would be Cardinal Copia, who made his live debut with the group at a private acoustic show on 6 April; he is not a part of the Papa Emeritus lineage.<ref name="Prequelle"/> Instead, Forge described the situation as "That's why we have a new guy," Forge explains. "The Cardinal is not the boss. He's just the toastmaster. A cardinal is junior to a pope figure. We still have Papa Emeritus [Zero, a.k.a. Papa Nihil] but he's passing on. He needs to teach the Cardinal to become a pope, to earn his skull paint."<ref>{{cite magazine|author=J.

Copia's costume consists of either cardinal vestments or a black or white tuxedo; he also sports a prosthetic mask with black eye makeup and multi-colored eyes, as with the prior Papa Emeritus characters.

=== Identities ===
[[File:Ghost - Austin 2016 5.jpg|thumb|left|The Nameless Ghouls performing in Austin, Texas, 2016]]
Anonymity is a major characteristic of Ghost; prior to 2017, the members had not publicly revealed their names, and the group's five instrumentalists are only referred to as "Nameless Ghouls". During signings, the Nameless Ghouls sign the merchandise by stamping their individual alchemical symbol, while Papa Emeritus signs with his stage name or the letters "P.E."<ref name="reddit"/> One Ghoul said the idea that the band's members remain anonymous to gain attention is a misconception, and that the idea was to remove their personalities to allow their audiences to focus upon the artwork itself. He also said, "Had not the music been rocking, I don't think that people would have gone gaga just about our looks".<ref name="arrival"/> In 2011, a Nameless Ghoul said, "We're often mistaken for roadies, which is helpful.

The [[Swedish Performing Rights Society]] was rumored to have Tobias Forge, vocalist of Swedish bands Subvision and [[Repugnant]] and former guitarist for [[Crashdïet]] (using the alias Mary Goore in the latter two), credited with songs as "A Ghoul Writer".<ref>{{cite web|first=Zach|last=Shaw|url=http://www.metalinsider.net/mystery-solved/ghost-frontman%E2%80%99s-identity-revealed|title=Ghost Frontman's Identity Revealed Tobias Forge|work=Metal Insider|date=22 August 2011|access-date=30 March 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240811095956/http://www.metalinsider.net/mystery-solved/ghost-frontman%E2%80%99s-identity-revealed|archive-date=11 August 2024|url-status=live}}</ref> All of the band's songs are credited to "A Ghoul Writer", causing people to suspect that Forge was Papa Emeritus. The online database for US-based performance rights society ASCAP, when having the name Tobias Forge entered into its search box, revealed all of Ghost's original songs (even though many of the tracks use the pseudonym "A Ghoul Writer" in the database itself)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ascap.com/ace/#ace/writer/293703355/FORGE%20TOBIAS%20JENS|title=ASCAP database of all songs written by Tobias Forge/A Ghoul Writer|publisher=[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]|access-date=21 October 2018}}</ref>  At the time, Ghost stated they would not comment on any rumors of their identities.<ref name="bminterview"/> Following a lawsuit in 2017, Forge's identity as Papa Emeritus was revealed.<ref name="lawsuit"/>

In March 2017, Swedish musician Martin Persner of the band [[Magna Carta Cartel]] claimed in a short video clip that he was the rhythm guitarist, also known as Omega, from 2009 to July 2016.
