'''The Tragically Hip''', often referred to simply as '''the Hip''', was a Canadian rock band formed in [[Kingston, Ontario]] in 1984, consisting of vocalist [[Gord Downie]], guitarist Paul Langlois, guitarist [[Rob Baker (guitarist)|Rob Baker]] (known as Bobby Baker until 1994), bassist Gord Sinclair, and drummer Johnny Fay. They released 13 studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, and over 50 singles over a 33-year career. Nine of their albums have reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Canadian charts. They have received numerous Canadian music awards, including 17 [[Juno Award]]s. Between 1996 and 2016, the Tragically Hip were the best-selling Canadian band in Canada and the fourth best-selling Canadian artist overall in Canada.<ref name="bds17">{{cite web|url=https://bdsradio.com/pd/docs/Nielsen_Canadian150_2017_vs2.pdf|title=Nielsen Music & Billboard Present Canada 150 Charts|website=bdsradio.com|access-date=January 2, 2020|archive-date=January 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102202137/https://bdsradio.com/pd/docs/Nielsen_Canadian150_2017_vs2.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following Downie's diagnosis with terminal brain cancer in 2015, the band undertook [[Man Machine Poem Tour|a tour of Canada]] in support of their thirteenth album, ''[[Man Machine Poem]]''.<ref name="downiecancer">{{cite web|last1=Fraser|first1=Laura|title=Gord Downie's 'incurable' brain cancer won't keep him from singing, his doctor says|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/gord-downie-cancer-doctor-1.3597361|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=May 24, 2016}}</ref> The tour's final concert, which would ultimately be the band's last show, was held at the [[Rogers K-Rock Centre]] in Kingston on August 20, 2016, and broadcast globally by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] as a cross-platform television, radio and internet streaming special.<ref name="apfinal"/>

==History==

===Formation===
The Tragically Hip formed in 1984 in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. Gord Sinclair and Rob Baker were students at [[Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute|Kingston Collegiate]] and had performed together at the KCVI Variety Show as the Rodents.  Baker and Sinclair joined with Downie and Fay in 1984 and began playing gigs around Kingston with some memorable stints at Clark Hall Pub and Alfie's, student bars on [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] campus. Guitarist Paul Langlois joined in 1986; saxophonist Davis Manning left that same year. They took their name from a skit in the [[Michael Nesmith]] movie ''[[Elephant Parts]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehip.com/HipArchive/hypercd/tth-early.htm |title=Early Days |publisher=thehip.com |access-date=December 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111095932/http://www.thehip.com/HipArchive/hypercd/tth-early.htm |archive-date=November 11, 2011 }}</ref>

===1987–1991===
By the mid-1980s, they performed in small music venues across Ontario until being seen by then-[[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] Vice President Bruce Dickinson at the [[Horseshoe Tavern]] in [[Toronto]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/T/Tragically_Hip.html |title=CANOE – JAM! Music – Pop Encyclopedia – Tragically Hip |publisher=Jam.canoe.ca |date=August 11, 2005 |access-date=October 3, 2012 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713134259/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/T/Tragically_Hip.html |archive-date=July 13, 2012 }}</ref> They were then signed to a long-term record deal with MCA, and recorded the [[extended play|EP]] ''[[The Tragically Hip (EP)|The Tragically Hip]]'', released in 1987. The album produced two singles, "Small Town Bring-Down" and "Highway Girl". They followed up with 1989's ''[[Up to Here]]''. This album produced four singles, "[[Blow at High Dough]]", "[[New Orleans Is Sinking]]", "Boots or Hearts", and "[[38 Years Old]]". All four of these songs found extensive rotation on [[modern rock]] radio play lists in Canada.

''[[Road Apples (album)|Road Apples]]'' followed in 1991, producing three singles ("[[Little Bones]]", "[[Twist My Arm]]", and "[[Three Pistols]]") and reaching No. 1 on Canadian record charts. During the Road Apples tour, Downie became recognized for ranting and telling fictional stories during songs such as "Highway Girl" and "New Orleans Is Sinking".  Road Apples was planned to be a double album but was rejected by Universal.  The [[2008 Universal Studios fire]] resulted in the destruction of the masters for the second album. The six unreleased songs were rediscovered in another collection in 2020. In 2021 they were released as an EP titled ''[[Saskadelphia]]'', which had been the working title for ''Road Apples.''

The sound on these first two full-length albums is sometimes characterized as "blues-tinged", although there is definite acoustic punctuation throughout both discs. Although the band failed to achieve significant international success with these first two albums, their sales and dominance of modern rock radio in Canada gave them license to subsequently explore their sound.

===1992–1997===
The band released another album, ''[[Fully Completely]]'' in 1992, which produced the singles "[[Locked in the Trunk of a Car]]", "[[Courage (for Hugh MacLennan)|Courage]]", "[[At the Hundredth Meridian]]", and three others. The sound on this album displayed less of a blues influence than previous albums. The Hip created and headlined the first [[Another Roadside Attraction (festival)|Another Roadside Attraction]] tour at this time, which also featured [[Midnight Oil]], [[Crash Vegas]], [[Hothouse Flowers]] and [[Daniel Lanois]].<ref name="Newton">{{cite web | url = https://www.straight.com/blogra/436936/earth-day-throwback-midnight-oils-tree-hugging-asshole-kicks-ass-clayoquot-sound | title = Earth Day throwback: Midnight Oil's 'tree-hugging asshole' kicks ass for Clayoquot Sound | author = Newton, Steve | publisher = Vancouver Free Press | work = [[The Georgia Straight]] | date = 22 April 2015 | access-date = 3 October 2015 }}</ref> The five artists on the tour collaborated together on the 1993 charity single "[[Land (song)|Land]]", which protested forest [[clearcutting]] in [[British Columbia]].<ref>Joseph Blake, "Other news on the Save-the-Clayoquot front". ''[[Victoria Times-Colonist]]'', November 2, 1993.</ref>

Many songs from ''Day For Night'' were first performed prior to their release during the 1993 Another Roadside Attraction Tour. "Nautical Disaster" was played frequently in the middle of "New Orleans Is Sinking", an early version of "Thugs" was tested, and Downie sang lyrics from many other ''Day For Night'' songs, such as "Grace, Too", "Scared", and "Emergency", during this tour.

''[[Day for Night (The Tragically Hip album)|Day for Night]]'' was then released in 1994,<ref name="Inc.1994">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=A Breakthrough Year for Canadian Acts|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53|date=December 24, 1994|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=53–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> producing six singles, including "[[Nautical Disaster]]" and "[[Grace, Too]]". ''[[Trouble at the Henhouse]]'' followed in 1996, producing five singles starting with "[[Ahead by a Century]]", which reached number one on the [[List of number-one singles of 1996 (Canada)|''RPM'' Canadian singles chart]] on 24 June and became their most successful single in their home country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.3013&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.3013.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.3013|title=RPM 100 Hit Tracks – June 24, 1996|work=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|date=July 17, 2013|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|access-date=31 March 2019}}</ref> "Butts Wigglin", the fifth single from ''Henhouse'', also appeared on the soundtrack to [[the Kids in the Hall]] movie ''[[Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy]]''. The live album ''[[Live Between Us]]'' was recorded on the subsequent tour at [[Cobo Arena]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].

The band developed a unique sound and ethos, leaving behind its earlier [[blues]] influence. Downie's vocal style changed while the band experimented with song structures and chord progressions. Songs explored the themes of Canadian geography and history, water and land, all motifs that became heavily associated with the Hip. While ''Fully Completely'' began an exploration of deeper themes, many critics consider ''Day for Night'' to be the Hip's artistry most fully realized. The sound here is typically called "enigmatic" and "dark", while critic MacKenzie Wilson praises "the poignancy of Downie's minimalism."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/day-for-night-mw0000627518|title=Day for Night – The Tragically Hip {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=March 30, 2017}}</ref>

On the follow-up tour for this album, the band made its only appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', on March 25, 1995, thanks in large part to the finagling of fellow Canadian and Kingston-area resident [[Dan Aykroyd]], who appeared on the show just to introduce them.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vimeo.com/261747317 |website=Vimeo |title=Tragically Hip - Grace Too - SNL-1995}}</ref> Aykroyd, who is a fan of the band, had personally lobbied ''SNL'' showrunner [[Lorne Michaels]] to book them as a musical guest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dan Aykroyd on the Tragically Hip, the blues, ghosts and the Caesar |url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/dan-aykroyd-on-the-tragically-hip-the-blues-ghosts-and-the-caesar-1.5137189 |website=CBC Radio |access-date=28 May 2019}}</ref> On the show, Gord Downie notably flubbed the start of the song "Grace, Too"—rather than the normal opening lyric, "He said I'm fabulously rich", Downie sang it as "He said I'm tragically hip".<ref name=flub/> The band later attributed the error to their pre-show used of [[marijuana]].<ref name=flub>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/the-tragically-hip-tell-the-story-of-their-flubbed-lyric-on-snl-30-years-ago |title=The Tragically Hip Tell the Story of Their Flubbed Lyric on SNL 30 Years Ago |first=Chris |last=Phelan |website=NBC.com |date=March 26, 2025 |accessdate=June 26, 2025}}</ref>

In July 1996, the Hip headlined [[Edenfest]]. The three-day concert took place at Mosport Park, in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada, just a few months after the LP ''Trouble at the Henhouse'' was released. The concert sold over 70,000 tickets total and was attended by an estimated 20,000 additional people<ref>{{Cite web |last=Beaumont |first=Mark |date=2022-01-07 |title=The Tragically Hip's 5 Key Shows |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-tragically-hips-5-key-shows |access-date=2024-03-09 |website=Louder |language=en}}</ref> who gained access to the concert site after the outside security broke down.

===1998–2003===
In 1998, the band released their sixth full-length album, ''[[Phantom Power (The Tragically Hip album)|Phantom Power]]'',<ref name="Inc.1999">{{cite magazine|author=Bettsy Powell|title=There's no place like home|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58|date=January 16, 1999|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages= and 58|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> which produced five singles. It won the [[Juno Awards of 1999|1999 Juno Award]]s for [[Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year|Best Rock Album]] and [[Juno Award for CD/DVD Artwork Design of the Year|Best Album Design]]. A single from the album, "[[Bobcaygeon (song)|Bobcaygeon]]", won the [[Juno Award for Single of the Year]] in 2000.

In February 1999, the Hip played the first concert at the brand new [[Air Canada Centre]] in Toronto, Ontario. In July 1999, the band was part of the lineup for the [[Woodstock '99]] festival in [[Rome, New York]]. On the second day of three, they were the first band to take the stage. They were followed by [[Kid Rock]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Herbert|first1=Geoff|title=Gord Downie brain cancer: Tragically Hip plan final tour as singer is terminal|url=http://www.syracuse.com/celebrity-news/index.ssf/2016/05/gord_downie_cancer_tragically_hip_tour.html|website=Syracuse.com|date=May 24, 2016|access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref>

Their next album, [[Music @ Work]]'','' was released in 2000. It won the [[Juno Awards of 2001|2001 Juno Award]] for [[Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year|Best Rock Album]]. The album featured back-up vocals from [[Julie Doiron]] on a number of tracks, and reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Canadian Billboard Charts.

In 2002, ''[[In Violet Light]],'' recorded by [[Hugh Padgham]] and [[Terry Manning]] at [[Compass Point Studios]] in the Bahamas was released, along with three singles from the album. It became certified platinum in Canada.<ref name="Certifcations"/> Later that year, the Hip made a cameo appearance in the [[Paul Gross]] film ''[[Men with Brooms]],'' playing a [[curling]] team from their hometown of Kingston. Three of their songs appear in the film, and they backed [[Sarah Harmer]] on a fourth, the soundtrack's lead single, "Silver Roads".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/culture/sarah-harmer-on-the-tragically-hips-legacy-and-laundry/|title=Sarah Harmer on the Tragically Hip's legacy—and laundry |website=Macleans.ca|date=August 17, 2016 |access-date=December 1, 2021}}</ref>

On October 10, 2002, the Tragically Hip performed two songs, "It's a Good Life If You Don't Weaken" and "Poets", as part of a [[Royal Command Performance|command performance]] for [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. In 2003, the band recorded a cover of "Black Day in July", a song about the 1967 [[12th Street Riot]] in Detroit, on ''[[Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot]]''.

===2004–2008===
 [[File:Tragically Hip 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: Gord Downie, Gord Sinclair and Rob Baker performing in Aspen, Colorado, 2007]]
''[[In Between Evolution]]'' was released in 2004 in the No.&nbsp;1 position in Canada. It has since sold over 100,000 copies.

At the 92nd [[Grey Cup]] held November 21, 2004, the band provided the halftime entertainment in front of a packed house at [[Frank Clair Stadium]] in Ottawa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ottawastart.com/story/628 |title=Tragically Hip To Rock Grey Cup Half-Time Show |publisher=OttawaStart.com |date=October 23, 2004 |access-date=October 3, 2012 |archive-date=June 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622044722/http://ottawastart.com/story/628 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2004, in episode 15 ("Rock On"), season 2 of Canadian comedy TV series ''[[Corner Gas]]'', the Tragically Hip gave a cameo appearance as an unnamed local band rehearsing in Brent's garage. They play a rough version of the song "It Can't Be Nashville Every Night" from their ''[[In Between Evolution]]'' album until interrupted and asked to leave by Brent, Wanda, and Hank. As they disappointedly go, Wanda demands that Gord Sinclair and Rob Baker leave behind their amplifiers.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eINGuQwrkPU | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524142336/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eINGuQwrkPU&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=2013-05-24 | url-status=dead| title=Tragically Hip cameo on Corner Gas|publisher=YouTube Video }}</ref>

In October 2005, several radio stations temporarily stopped playing "[[New Orleans Is Sinking]]", out of sensitivity to the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], which had devastated the city in early September of that year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/39426/ottawa-radio-stations-pull-hip-song-after-hurricane-tragedy | title=Ottawa Radio Stations Pull Hip Song After Hurricane Tragedy | date=August 31, 2005 | first=David | last=MacDougall | work=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]] | access-date=August 9, 2009 | url-status=usurped | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318070716/http://www.chartattack.com/news/39426/ottawa-radio-stations-pull-hip-song-after-hurricane-tragedy | archive-date=March 18, 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gcal.ac.uk/politicalsong/news/2005.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312022640/http://www.gcal.ac.uk/politicalsong/news/2005.html|date=March 12, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiright.com/artists/tragicallyhip.shtml |title=Tragically Hip: Fun Music Information Facts, Trivia, Lyrics |publisher=Amiright.com |access-date=October 3, 2012}}</ref> However, it received considerable pirate radio and relief site play and gained some notoriety and praise in New Orleans due to its attitudinal proximity to the city's culture.

On November 1, 2005, the Hip released a double CD, double DVD [[box set]], ''[[Hipeponymous]]'', including all of their singles and music videos to date, a backstage documentary called "Macroscopic", an animated Hip-scored short film entitled "The Right Whale", two brand new songs ("No Threat" and "The New Maybe"), a full-length concert from November 2004 ''[[That Night in Toronto]]'', and a 2-CD greatest hits collection ''[[Yer Favourites]]'' (selected on-line by 150,000 fans). On November 8, 2005, ''Yer Favourites'' and ''That Night in Toronto'' were released individually.

In 2006, another studio album, entitled ''[[World Container]]'', was released, being notably produced by [[Bob Rock]]. It produced four singles, and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the Canadian rock music charts. The band toured concert dates in major Canadian cities, and then as an opening act for [[the Who]] on several US dates. A tour of Eastern Canada, Europe, and select cities in the United States occurred late in the year.

On February 23, 2008, the Hip returned to their hometown of Kingston, Ontario, where they were the first live act to perform at the new [[K-Rock Centre]].

===2009–2015===
<!-- '''Please note''': The Tragically Hip continues to exist as a band.

'''Please do not amend the article to refer to a former band or to the band's last concert until this has been confirmed by the band.''' Thank you. -->

In 2009, the band again worked with producer Bob Rock, and ''[[We Are the Same]]'' was released in North America on April 7, 2009. It produced three singles. To promote ''We Are the Same'', the band invited [[The Hour (Canadian TV series)|The Hour]]'s [[George Stroumboulopoulos]] for a live interview at The [[Bathouse Recording Studio]] in [[Bath, Ontario]] (where most of the album was recorded), and they played seven new songs as well as unique versions of five other songs. The interview and performance were broadcast live in more than eighty theatres across Canada.

On January 22, 2010, the band performed "Fiddler's Green" at the "Canada for Haiti" telethon to aid earthquake victims in that country. This was broadcast nationally on all three of Canada's main networks ([[CBC Television|CBC]], [[Global Television Network|Global]], and [[CTV television network|CTV]]).

Single "[[At Transformation]]" was released in May 2012 ahead of the band's twelfth studio album, ''[[Now for Plan A]].'' A second single, "Streets Ahead" came out in August that year, and the album followed in October.

The Tragically Hip re-entered their studio in July 2014 to begin work on a new album.
