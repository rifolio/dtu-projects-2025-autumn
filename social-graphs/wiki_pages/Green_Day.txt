'''Green Day''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]]<!-- Do not change; this is the genre settled on for the lead section after much discussion on the talk page. Other genre labels are discussed further down and are listed in the infobox --> band formed in [[Rodeo, California]], in 1987, by lead vocalist and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] and bassist and backing vocalist [[Mike Dirnt]], with drummer [[Tré Cool]] joining in 1990. In 1994, their major-label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 20 million copies in the U.S. Green Day has been credited with reigniting mainstream interest in [[punk rock]].

Before taking its current name in 1989, the band was named '''Blood Rage''', then '''Sweet Children'''. They were part of the [[Punk rock in California|late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene]] that emerged from [[924 Gilman Street]], a club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]], including their first album ''[[39/Smooth]]'' (1990). For most of the band's career, they have been a [[power trio]]<ref name="waldman">{{cite web |last1=Waldman |first1=Scott |title=21 Northern Californian artists who have influenced AFI's Hunter Burgan |url=https://www.altpress.com/afi-hunter-burgan-most-influential-bands/ |website=Alternative Press |date=March 8, 2021 |access-date=July 3, 2022 |archive-date=July 5, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705111004/https://www.altpress.com/afi-hunter-burgan-most-influential-bands/ |url-status=live}}</ref> with Cool, who replaced [[John Kiffmeyer]] in 1990, before the recording of the band's second studio album ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1991). Though the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful, with ''Insomniac'' and ''Nimrod'' reaching double platinum status, while ''Warning'' achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation and sold six million copies in the U.S. Their next album ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'' was released in 2009. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[¡Uno!]]'', ''[[¡Dos!]]'', and ''[[¡Tré!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not commercially perform as well as expected, in comparison to their previous albums, largely due to a lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. These albums were followed by ''[[Revolution Radio]]'' (2016), which became their third to debut at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|'' Billboard'' 200]], ''[[Father of All Motherfuckers]]'' (2020), and ''[[Saviors (album)|Saviors]]'' (2024).

In 2010, a [[American Idiot (musical)|stage adaptation of ''American Idiot'']] debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]]: [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]], and [[Tony Award for Best Lighting Design|Best Lighting Design]], winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have collaborated on the side projects [[Pinhead Gunpowder]], [[the Network]], [[Foxboro Hot Tubs]], [[The Longshot (band)|the Longshot]], and [[the Coverups]]. They have also worked on solo careers.

Green Day has sold roughly 75 million records worldwide as of 2024,<ref name=Green_Day_Biggest_Hits_2024/> making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. The group has been nominated for 20 [[Grammy Awards]] and won five: [[Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] for ''Dookie'', [[Best Rock Album]] for ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', [[Record of the Year]] for "[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]", and [[Best Musical Show Album]] for ''[[American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording]]''.

Green Day collaborated with [[Iggy Pop]] on two tracks for his album ''[[Skull Ring]]'' in November 2003. On February 1, 2004, a cover of "[[I Fought the Law]]" (originally performed by [[The Crickets]]) made its debut on a commercial for [[iTunes]] during [[NFL]] [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]].
''[[American Idiot]]'' was released in September 2004 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Backed by the success of the album's first single "[[American Idiot (song)|American Idiot]]", it was the band's first album to reach this pinnacle.

Green Day's sound is described as "often hard-driving and aggressive", and is often compared to first wave American and British punk rock bands such as the [[Ramones]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], [[the Dickies]], and [[Buzzcocks]]. The band is primarily known for its heavy use of [[power chords]] combined with "strong pop melodic sensibility".<ref name="snotty"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Covach |first1=John |last2=Flory |first2=Andrew |title=What's That Sound?: An Introduction to Rock and Its History |date=July 1, 2022 |publisher=W.

=== Lyrical themes ===
Green Day's lyrics explore themes including [[adolescence]], [[substance abuse]], [[Broken heart|heartbreak]], [[political sociology]] and [[anti-authoritarianism]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Blog |first=N.

In 2016, a study of 361 musical artists conducted by music data company [[Musixmatch]] found that Green Day used profanity the most among the rock music artists included in the study, beating out [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Aerosmith]]. The study suggested that across a selection of 136 tracks from the band's catalogue, the swear words most frequently uttered were "[[fuck]]", "fucking", and "[[shit]]", respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Study: These Are the Most Profane Bands in Metal and Rock |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/study_these_are_the_most_profane_bands_in_metal_and_rock.html |access-date=2025-08-04 |website=Ultimate-guitar.com |language=en}}</ref>

=== Live performances ===
Billie Joe Armstrong regularly invites musicians at Green Day concerts onstage to substitute for the band members on guitar, bass and drums, often letting the guest musicians keep the instruments they used during their guest spots. Armstrong explains, "I remember being a kid and seeing Van Halen play. I was, like, 12, and Eddie would come out, and I'd go, 'God, it would be so cool to be up there and do what he's doing. So I was always keeping that in mind, subconsciously that's basically what ended up happening, breaking down the barrier between the band and the audience."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Green Day Frontman Explains Why He Takes People From Audience Onstage to Play Guitar & How Eddie Van Halen Influenced It |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/green_day_frontman_explains_why_he_takes_people_from_audience_onstage_to_play_guitar__how_eddie_van_halen_influenced_it.html |access-date=July 8, 2023 |archive-date=July 8, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230708210002/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/green_day_frontman_explains_why_he_takes_people_from_audience_onstage_to_play_guitar__how_eddie_van_halen_influenced_it.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=WATCH: 11-Year-Old Fan Shreds On Guitar With Green Day During 'Hella Mega Tour' Concert |date=August 18, 2021 |url=https://musicmayhemmagazine.com/watch-11-year-old-fan-shreds-on-guitar-with-green-day-during-hella-mega-tour-concert/ |access-date=July 8, 2023 |archive-date=July 8, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230708210002/https://musicmayhemmagazine.com/watch-11-year-old-fan-shreds-on-guitar-with-green-day-during-hella-mega-tour-concert/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2009, the band collaborated with theater director [[Michael Mayer (director)|Michael Mayer]] to adapt the group's [[rock opera]] ''American Idiot'' into a one-act stage [[American Idiot (musical)|musical]] that premiered at the [[Berkeley Rep]] on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of ''American Idiot: The Musical'' have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show "a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past." Jed Gottlieb of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' enjoyed the premise of the show but found that "the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/arts_culture/view.bg?articleid=1248227&position=0|title=Tale told by 'Idiot' lacks sound, fury|last=Gottlieb|first=Jay|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=April 19, 2010|access-date=December 19, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007042217/http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/arts_culture/view.bg?articleid=1248227&position=0|archive-date=October 7, 2010}}</ref>

Michael Kuchiwara of the [[Associated Press]] found the show to be "visually striking [and] musically adventurous", but noted that "the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development". Paul Kolnik in ''[[USA Today]]'' enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's "massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season". ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score "is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered, [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show falls short is as a fully developed narrative." He concluded that "''American Idiot'', despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers—for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway."<ref>Zoglin, Richard. "Punks Take Broadway", ''Time'' magazine, May 3, 2010, pp. 62–63</ref> Peter Travers from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in his review of ''American Idiot'', wrote "Though ''American Idiot'' carries echoes of such rock musicals as ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'', it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you.

===''New Years Rev''===
On February 10, 2024, [[Live Nation Productions]] announced a [[comedy film]] titled ''New Years Rev'', which was described as a "coming-of-age tale", inspired by the true exploits of the band prior to their mainstream breakthrough in 1994. Production of the film was said to be underway in the US state of [[Oklahoma]]. Lee Kirk was announced as the film's writer and director. As of February 11, a release date had not been announced. Live Nation Productions, the film and TV arm of [[Live Nation Entertainment]], was said to be producing the film. Green Day guitarist and vocalist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]], bassist [[Mike Dirnt]], and drummer [[Tré Cool]] were announced as the film's producers, in collaboration with Tim Perell. The band members were also confirmed to be making an appearance in the film themselves. Ryan Kroft, [[Michael Rapino]], Jonathan Daniel were announced as the film's executive producers. [[Mason Thames]], Kylr Coffman and Ryan Foust were announced as the film's stars.  [[Jenna Fischer]], who portrayed the character [[Pam Beesley]] in the American sitcom ''[[The Office (US)|The Office]]'', was confirmed to have a role in the film. [[Angela Kinsey]], who acted in the same series, was also confirmed to have a role in the film. The film's logline read, "Their roadtrip is a rowdy and mischievous jaunt across the country filled with adventures, based on the exploits of Green Day and their years of living in a tour van." According to Ryan Kroft of Live Nation Productions, the film "[tells] the story of three friends as they travel across the United States after mistakenly thinking they'll be opening for a Green Day New Years concert in [[Los Angeles]]." Billie Joe Armstrong said, "Van days rule. You will drive all night on no sleep then play a show for 10 kids in a basement of a friend of a friend's house 50 miles east of anywhere you've ever heard of. But you'll do it again the next day, and the one after that. Because you're doing it with your bandmates who become your family and it's unlike anything you've ever known. It's electric. Let the music and mischief ensue." Lee Kirk had previously worked with Billie Joe Armstrong on the 2016 ''[[Ordinary World (film)|Ordinary World]]'', which the latter had made an appearance in. Kirk had also previously directed an episode of ''The Office'', and is also the spouse of Jenna Fischer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Singh |first=Surej |date=2025-02-11 |title=A Green Day-inspired comedy film is in the works |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/a-green-day-inspired-comedy-film-is-in-the-works-3836789 |access-date=2025-02-17 |website=NME |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Shanfeld |first=Ethan |date=2025-02-10 |title=Green Day-Inspired Comedy Movie in the Works From Live Nation Productions (EXCLUSIVE) |url=https://variety.com/2025/film/news/green-day-movie-live-nation-1236299058/ |access-date=2025-02-17 |website=Variety |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Green Day Comedy New Years Rev Mason Thames | website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/green-day-comedy-new-years-rev-mason-thames-1236132276/%7Cfocal_event=true}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Childers |first=Chad|date=2025-02-11 |title=What Green Day's New Comedy Movie Is About |url=https://loudwire.com/green-day-comedy-movie-new-years-rev/ |access-date=2025-02-17 |website=Loudwire |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Kazi |first=Safeeyah |date=2025-02-11 |title=It's a Punk Revival!

== Controversies ==
===Music style===
Green Day has generated controversy over whether their musical style and [[Selling out|major-label status]] constitutes "true [[Punk rock|punk]]".<ref name="softpedia2005">{{cite web|url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Green-Day-Still-A-Punk-Band-10426.shtml|title= Green Day Still A Punk Band|date= October 5, 2005 |access-date=December 4, 2010|first=Mihaela|last=Stroia|publisher=Softpedia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728121625/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Green-Day-Still-A-Punk-Band-10426.shtml|archive-date=July 28, 2013}}</ref> In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, [[John Lydon]], former frontman of the 1970s punk band the [[Sex Pistols]] commented, "So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=13310 |title=John Lydon Calls Green Day "Plonk" Not "Punk" |last=Melia |first=Daniel |access-date=September 11, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211060301/http://www.gigwise.com/news.asp?contentid=13310 |archive-date=February 11, 2007}}</ref> However, others in the punk rock scene would come to the defense of the band on their punk status. [[Bad Religion]] lead guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] and founder of the independent punk label [[Epitaph Records]] would state, "They [Green Day] are a punk band, but you know, punk is the legacy of [[rock and roll]], and Green Day are the biggest band in the genre."<ref name="earlyyears">{{cite web |title=Green Day – The Early Years |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TpfOvCPTHk&feature=youtu.be | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/2TpfOvCPTHk| archive-date=December 11, 2021 | url-status=live|via=YouTube |publisher=[[Spotify]] |access-date=August 15, 2021 |year=2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Armstrong has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying, "Sometimes I think we've become redundant because we're this big band now; we've made a lot of money—we're not punk rock anymore. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can't take the punk rock out of us.{{' "}}<ref name="softpedia2005"/> In 2021, Armstrong condemned the band's labeling as "pop-punk" by critics in a [[New York (magazine)|Vulture]] magazine interview, stating, "I never really liked that term (pop punk), it turned into sort of a genre. I never thought of myself as a pop artist. I've always been left of center. To say you're a pop-punker ... it never sat well with me." Armstrong acknowledged the band's more melodic punk style compared to other bands from the Bay Area scene it emerged from, but also brought up the band's performance alongside East Bay hardcore bands like [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], Engage, [[Spitboy]], [[Blatz (band)|Blatz]], and [[Filth (band)|Filth]].<ref name="jenkins">{{cite web |last1=Jenkins |first1=Craig |title=The Best and Most Misunderstood of Green Day, According to Billie Joe Armstrong |url=https://www.vulture.com/article/interview-billie-joe-armstrong-green-day-history.html |website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]] |access-date=April 28, 2022 |date=April 22, 2021 |archive-date=June 30, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220630140823/https://www.vulture.com/article/interview-billie-joe-armstrong-green-day-history.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2006, English rock musician [[Noel Gallagher]] of the Britpop band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that the band had ripped off his song "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]" with "[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/a40981/noel-gallagher-hits-out-at-green-day.html|title=Noel Gallagher hits out at Green Day|access-date=July 3, 2009|first=Matt|last=Houghton|date=December 21, 2006|work=Digital Spy|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010192701/http://www.digitalspy.com/music/a40981/noel-gallagher-hits-out-at-green-day.html|archive-date=October 10, 2009}}</ref>

===2012 iHeartRadio Festival incident===
On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing "[[Basket Case (song)|Basket Case]]", because he believed the group's time was being shortened, possibly to extend R&B artist [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled "1 Minutes [Left]", saying "You're gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!" He also told the crowd he "was not [[Justin Bieber]]" and labeled the festival as a "joke". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave [[the finger]], and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9zogQOmQVM/| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/g9zogQOmQVM| archive-date=December 11, 2021 | url-status=live|title= Green Day Billie Joe freaks out at the I Heart Radio Music Festival and smashes guitar| date=September 22, 2012|access-date= October 16, 2013|via= YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident on the group's behalf stating that "Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas", also adding that Armstrong would be headed to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]], for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/celebrities/index.ssf/2013/02/billie_joe_armstrong_rehab_1.html |title=Billie Joe Armstrong on pill-popping: Backpack sounded like 'giant baby's rattle' |work=The Star-Ledger |date=February 28, 2013 |access-date=November 25, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103224438/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/celebrities/index.ssf/2013/02/billie_joe_armstrong_rehab_1.html |archive-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2012/09/23/green-days-billie-joe-armstrong-heads-to-rehab/70000969/1#.Ul9-UySXKAJ|title= Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong heads to rehab|date= September 23, 2012|access-date= October 16, 2013|website= USA Today|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140113110018/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2012/09/23/green-days-billie-joe-armstrong-heads-to-rehab/70000969/1#.Ul9-UySXKAJ|archive-date= January 13, 2014|df= mdy-all}}</ref> However, Dirnt would later say in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that he agreed with what Armstrong meant by his rant.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/q-a-green-days-mike-dirnt-on-billie-joe-armstrongs-recovery-20130301|title=Q&A: Green Day's Mike Dirnt on Billie Joe Armstrong's Recovery|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=October 2, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005201955/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/alternate-take/q-a-green-days-mike-dirnt-on-billie-joe-armstrongs-recovery-20130301|archive-date=October 5, 2013}}</ref> The band later made amends with the company and played an album release party for their 2016 release, ''Revolution Radio''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iheart.com/content/2016-10-12-green-day-iheartradio-album-release-party-on-att-iheartradio-theater-la-watch/|title=Green Day iHeartRadio Album Release Party On AT&T iHeartRadio Theater LA (Watch)|work=iHeart Radio|date=October 12, 2016|access-date=February 17, 2021|archive-date=July 6, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220706234925/https://www.iheart.com/content/2016-10-12-green-day-iheartradio-album-release-party-on-att-iheartradio-theater-la-watch/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="iHeart16and19">{{cite web|first=Jem|last=Aswad|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/green-day-iheartradio-music-festival-1203333223/|title=Green Day to Perform at 2019 iHeartRadio Music Festival|work=Variety|date=September 12, 2019|access-date=February 17, 2021|archive-date=August 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220807173432/https://variety.com/2019/music/news/green-day-iheartradio-music-festival-1203333223/|url-status=live}}</ref> They also returned to the festival in 2019 supporting the album ''Father of All Motherfuckers''.<ref name="iHeart16and19"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-09-17-australia-news-green-day-to-return-to-iheartradio-music-festival-stage-joins-2019-lineup/|title=Green Day to Return to iHeartRadio Music Festival Stage, Joins 2019 Lineup|work=iHeart Radio|date=September 17, 2019|access-date=February 17, 2021|archive-date=August 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220807173432/https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-09-17-australia-news-green-day-to-return-to-iheartradio-music-festival-stage-joins-2019-lineup/|url-status=live}}</ref>
