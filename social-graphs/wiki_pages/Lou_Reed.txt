'''Lewis Allan Reed''' (March 2, 1942{{spnd}}October 27, 2013) was an American musician and songwriter. He was the guitarist, singer, and principal songwriter for the rock band [[the Velvet Underground]] and had a solo career that spanned five decades. Although not commercially successful during its existence, the Velvet Underground came to be regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of [[underground music|underground]] and [[alternative rock]] music. Reed's distinctive deadpan voice, poetic and [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] lyrics, and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career.

Having played guitar and sung in [[doo-wop]] groups in high school, Reed studied poetry at [[Syracuse University]] under [[Delmore Schwartz]], and served as a [[radio DJ]], hosting a late-night [[avant-garde music]] program while at college. After graduating from Syracuse, he went to work for [[Pickwick Records]] in New York City, a low-budget record company that specialized in [[sound-alike]] recordings, as a songwriter and session musician. A fellow session player at Pickwick was [[John Cale]]; together with [[Sterling Morrison]] and [[Angus MacLise]], they would form the Velvet Underground in 1965. After building a reputation in the avant garde music scene, they gained the attention of [[Andy Warhol]], who became the band's manager; they in turn became something of a fixture at [[The Factory]], Warhol's art studio, and served as his "house band" for various projects. The band released their [[Velvet Underground & Nico|first album]], now with drummer [[Moe Tucker]] and featuring German singer [[Nico]], in 1967, and parted ways with Warhol shortly thereafter. Following several lineup changes and three more little-heard albums, Reed quit the band in 1970.

After leaving the band, Reed would go on to embark on a much more commercially successful solo career, releasing twenty solo studio albums. His second, ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'' (1972), was produced by [[David Bowie]] and arranged by [[Mick Ronson]], and brought him mainstream recognition. The album is considered an influential landmark of the [[glam rock]] genre, anchored by Reed's most successful single, "[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]". After ''Transformer'', the less commercial but critically acclaimed ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' peaked at No. 7 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Animal]]'' (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and ''[[Sally Can't Dance]]'' (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; but for a long period after, Reed's work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with ''[[The Blue Mask]]'' (1982) and ''[[New Sensations]]'' (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album ''[[New York (album)|New York]]''.

Reed participated in the re-formation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and he made several more albums, including a collaboration album with [[John Cale]] titled ''[[Songs for Drella]]'', which was a tribute to their former mentor [[Andy Warhol]]. ''[[Magic and Loss]]'' (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.

He contributed music to two theatrical interpretations of 19th-century writers, one of which he developed into an album titled ''[[The Raven (Lou Reed album)|The Raven]]''. He married his third wife [[Laurie Anderson]] in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album ''[[Lulu (Lou Reed and Metallica album)|Lulu]]'' with [[Metallica]]. He died in 2013 of [[liver disease]]. Reed has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice: as a member of the Velvet Underground in 1996 and as a solo act in 2015.

=== 1958–1964: Early recordings and education ===
[[File:Lou Reed HS Yearbook (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Reed as a high school senior, 1959]]
Reed's first recording was as a member of a [[doo-wop]] three-piece group called the Jades, with Reed providing guitar accompaniment and backing vocals.{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=53}} After participating at a talent show at Freeport Junior High School in early 1958, and receiving an enthusiastic response from the audience,<ref name=landemaine>{{cite web|first=Olivier |last=Landemaine |date=October 26, 2008 |title=So Blue: An interview with Phil Harris |url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/loureed/thejades/jades.html}}</ref> the group was given the chance to record an original single "So Blue" with the B-side "Leave Her for Me" later that year.{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=53}} While the single did not reach any music hit parade, notable saxophonist [[King Curtis]] was brought in as a session musician by the producer [[Bob Shad]] to play on both songs,{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=53}}<ref name=landemaine/> and the single was played by a substitute DJ during the [[Murray the K]] radio show,{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=54}} which gave Reed his first-ever airplay.{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=53}}<ref name=landemaine/> Reed's love for playing music and his desire to play gigs brought him into confrontation with his anxious and unaccommodating parents.<ref name=medium/>

His sister recalled that during his first year in college, at [[New York University]], he was brought home one day, having had a [[mental breakdown]], after which he remained "depressed, anxious, and socially unresponsive" for a time, and that his parents were having difficulty coping.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hermes |first=Will |title=Lou Reed: the King of New York |date=2023 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-0-374-19339-3 |edition=1st |location=New York |publication-date=2023 |pages=24–31}}</ref> Visiting a psychologist, Reed's parents were made to feel guilty as inadequate parents, and they consented to giving him [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT).<ref name=medium/> Reed appeared to blame his father for the treatment to which he had been subjected.<ref name=medium/> He wrote about the experience in his song "Kill Your Sons" from the album ''[[Sally Can't Dance]]'' (1974).<ref name="Salon.com_LouReed_Syracuse_BA">{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/people/bc/2000/05/16/reed|title=Lou Reed|last=Colin|first=Chris|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|access-date=June 23, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107125917/http://dir.salon.com/people/bc/2000/05/16/reed|archive-date=November 7, 2010}}</ref> Reed later recalled the experience as having been traumatic and leading to memory loss.

Upon his recovery from his illness and associated treatment, Reed resumed his education at [[Syracuse University]] in 1960,<ref name=medium/> studying journalism, film directing, and creative writing.

===1964–1970: Pickwick and the Velvet Underground===
[[File:Velvet Underground 1968 by Billy Name.png|thumb|upright=0.75|The Velvet Underground, 1968 (left to right: Reed, Tucker, Yule, Morrison)]]
Reed moved to New York City in 1964 to work as an in-house songwriter for [[Pickwick Records]]. He can be heard singing lead on two cuts on ''The Surfsiders Sing The Beach Boys Songbook''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Surfsiders-The-Surfsiders-Sing-The-Beach-Boys-Songbook/release/2066726|title = The Surfsiders – the Surfsiders Sing the Beach Boys Songbook (1967, Vinyl)|website = [[Discogs]]| year=1967 }}</ref> For Pickwick, Reed also wrote and recorded the single "The Ostrich", a parody of popular dance songs of the time, which included lines such as "put your head on the floor and have somebody step on it". His employers felt that the song had hit potential, and assembled a supporting band to help promote the recording. The ''ad hoc'' band, called the Primitives, consisted of Reed; Welsh musician [[John Cale]], who had recently moved to New York to study music and was playing viola in composer [[La Monte Young]]'s [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], on bass; [[Tony Conrad]], violinist in the Theatre of Eternal Music, on guitar; and sculptor [[Walter De Maria]] on percussion. Cale and Conrad were surprised to find that for "The Ostrich", Reed tuned each string of his guitar to the same note, which they began to call "[[ostrich guitar]]" tuning. This technique created a [[drone (music)|drone]] effect similar to their experimentation in Young's [[avant-garde]] ensemble. Disappointed with Reed's performance, Cale was nevertheless impressed by Reed's early repertoire (including "[[Heroin (The Velvet Underground song)|Heroin]]"), and a partnership began to evolve.<ref name=documentary/>

Reed and Cale (who played viola, keyboards and bass guitar) lived together on the [[Lower East Side]], and invited Reed's college acquaintance Sterling Morrison and Cale's neighbor and Theatre of Eternal Music bandmate [[Angus MacLise]] to join the band on guitar and drums respectively, thus forming [[the Velvet Underground]]. When the opportunity came to play their first paying gig at [[Summit High School (New Jersey)|Summit High School]] in [[Summit, New Jersey]], MacLise quit because he believed that accepting money for art was [[selling out]] and did not want to participate in a structured gig. He was replaced by [[Moe Tucker]], the sister of Reed and Morrison's mutual friend Jim Tucker. Initially a fill-in for that one show, she soon became a full-time member with her drumming an integral part of the band's sound, despite Cale's initial objections. Though it had little commercial success, the band is considered one of the most influential in rock history.<ref name="nrr-loc">{{cite web |title=News from the Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2007/07-039.html |website=National Recording Registry |publisher=Library of Congress |date=March 6, 2007 |quote=For decades this album has cast a huge shadow over nearly every sub-variety of avant-garde rock, from 1970s art-rock to No Wave, New Wave and Punk.

{{quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=Had he accomplished nothing else, his work with the Velvet Underground in the late sixties would assure him a place in anyone's rock & roll pantheon; those remarkable songs still serve as an articulate aural nightmare of men and women caught in the beauty and terror of sexual, street and drug paranoia, unwilling or unable to move. The message is that urban life is tough stuff—it will kill you; Reed, the poet of destruction, knows it but never looks away and somehow finds holiness as well as perversity in both his sinners and his quest. ...

The band soon came to the attention of [[Andy Warhol]]. One of Warhol's first contributions was to integrate them into the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]]. Warhol's associates inspired many of Reed's songs as he fell into a thriving, multifaceted artistic scene.{{sfnp|Reed|1991|pp=22, 38, 42}}{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=18}} Reed rarely gave an interview without paying homage to Warhol as a mentor. Warhol pushed the band to take on a [[chanteuse]], the German former model and singer [[Nico]]. Despite his initial resistance, Reed wrote several songs for Nico to sing, and the two were briefly lovers.{{sfnp|Bockris|1994|pp=104, 106, 107}}

By the time the band recorded ''[[White Light/White Heat]]'', Nico had quit the band and Warhol had been fired, both against Cale's wishes. Warhol's replacement as manager was [[Steve Sesnick]]. In September 1968, Reed told Morrison and Tucker that he would dissolve the band if they did not let him fire Cale; they agreed, and Reed had Morrison inform Cale of his firing.{{sfnp|Bockris|1994|p=160}} Morrison and Tucker were discomfited by Reed's tactics but remained in the band. Cale's replacement was [[Boston]]-based musician [[Doug Yule]], who played bass guitar and keyboards and would soon share lead vocal duties with Reed.{{sfnp|Bockris|1994|pp=164, 167}} The band now took on a more pop-oriented sound and acted more as a vehicle for Reed to develop his songwriting craft.{{sfnp|Bockris|1994|pp=164, 166}} They released two studio albums with this lineup: 1969's ''[[The Velvet Underground (album)|The Velvet Underground]]'' and 1970's ''[[Loaded (The Velvet Underground album)|Loaded]]''.

After leaving the Velvet Underground, Reed moved to his parents' home on [[Long Island]] and took a job at his father's tax accounting firm as a typist, by his own account earning $40 a week<ref>{{cite web |title=Topic 354: Richie Unterberger, White Light / White Heat |date=May 30, 2009 |page=3 |work=The WELL |url=http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/354/Richie-Unterberger-White-Light-W-page03.html#post58 |access-date=November 4, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202055654/http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/354/Richie-Unterberger-White-Light-W-page03.html#post58 |archive-date=December 2, 2012}}</ref> (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40|1970}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). He began writing poetry, which was published later in 2018 by [[Anthology Editions]] through the Lou Reed Estate.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Do Angels Need Haircuts? |url=https://anthology.net/book/do-angels-need-haircuts/ |access-date=July 6, 2023 |website=Anthology |language=en-US}}</ref> He signed a recording contract with [[RCA Records]] in 1971 and recorded his first solo album at [[Morgan Studios]] in [[Willesden]], London with session musicians including [[Steve Howe]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] from the band [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. The album, ''[[Lou Reed (album)|Lou Reed]]'', contained versions of unreleased Velvet Underground songs, some of which had originally been recorded for ''Loaded'' but shelved.{{refn|Some later appeared on the ''[[Peel Slowly and See]]'' box set.|group=nb}} This album was overlooked by most pop music critics and did not sell well, although music critic [[Stephen Holden]], in ''Rolling Stone'', called it an "almost perfect album. ... which embodied the spirit of the Velvets." Holden went on to compare Reed's voice with those of [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Bob Dylan]] and praise the poetic quality of his lyrics.<ref>Holden, Stephen (May 25, 1972). ''Rolling Stone''. p. 68</ref>

Reed's commercial breakthrough album, ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'', was released in November 1972. ''Transformer'' was co-produced by [[David Bowie]] and [[Mick Ronson]], and it introduced Reed to a wider audience, especially in the UK. The single "[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]" was a salute to the misfits and hustlers who once surrounded Andy Warhol in the late '60s and appeared in his films. Each of the song's five verses describes a person who had been a fixture at [[The Factory]] during the mid-to-late 1960s. The five individuals described in the song are [[Holly Woodlawn]] (verse one), [[Candy Darling]] (verse two), [[Joe Dallesandro|"Little Joe" Dallesandro]] (verse three), "Sugar Plum Fairy" [[Joe Campbell (actor)|Joe Campbell]] (verse four), and [[Jackie Curtis]] (verse five). The song's transgressive lyrics evaded radio censorship. Though the jazzy arrangement (courtesy of bassist [[Herbie Flowers]] and saxophonist [[Ronnie Ross]]) was musically atypical for Reed, it eventually became his signature song.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Wiener|first1=John|title=Beatles Buy-Out|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/music/beatles-buy-out|magazine=The New Republic|date=May 11, 1987}}</ref> It came about as a result of a commission to compose a soundtrack to a theatrical adaptation of [[Nelson Algren]]'s [[A Walk on the Wild Side|novel of the same name]]; the play failed to materialize.{{sfnp|Reed|1991|p=42}} "Walk on the Wild Side" was Reed's only entry in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart, at No. 16.<ref name="Caulfield">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5770575/lou-reed-billboard-chart-history|title=Lou Reed's 'Perfect' Billboard Chart History|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=October 27, 2013|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=February 17, 2018}}</ref>

Ronson's arrangements brought out new aspects of Reed's songs. "[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]", for example, features delicate strings and soaring dynamics. It was rediscovered in the 1990s and allowed Reed to drop "Walk on the Wild Side" from his concerts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/blurred-vision-at-the-beeb-1235724.html|last1=Walker|first1=Nick|date=October 13, 1997|title=Blurred vision at the Beeb|website=The Independent}}</ref>

Several years later, Bowie and Reed fell out during a late-night meeting which led to Reed hitting Bowie. Bowie had reportedly told Reed that he would have to "clean up his act" if they were to work together again.{{sfnp|DeCurtis|2017|p=}}{{refn|The two reconciled years later, and Reed performed with Bowie at the latter's 50th birthday concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesound.co.nz/home/music/2018/01/david-bowie-s-50th-birthday-performance-with-lou-reed.html|title=David Bowie's 50th birthday performance with Lou Reed|access-date=February 16, 2018}}</ref>|group=nb}}

Reed hired a local New York bar-band, the Tots, to tour in support of ''Transformer'' and spent much of 1972 and early 1973 on the road with them. Though they improved over the months, Reed (with producer [[Bob Ezrin]]'s encouragement) decided to recruit a new backing band in anticipation of the upcoming ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' album. He chose keyboardist [[Moogy Klingman]] to come up with a new five-member band on barely a week's notice.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/lou-reed-and-moogy-klingman-band/concerts/kansas-city-memorial-hall-may-02-1973.html | work=Wolfgangs Vault | title=Concert Summary: May 2, 1973 | last=Bershaw | access-date=March 2, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523090717/http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/lou-reed-and-moogy-klingman-band/concerts/kansas-city-memorial-hall-may-02-1973.html | archive-date=May 23, 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' (July 1973) was a [[concept album]] about two [[Amphetamine#Addiction|speed-freaks]] in love in the city. The songs variously concern [[domestic violence]] ("Caroline Says I", "Caroline Says II"), drug addiction ("How Do You Think It Feels"), adultery and prostitution ("The Kids"), and suicide ("The Bed"). Reed's late 1973 European tour, featuring lead guitarists [[Steve Hunter]] and [[Dick Wagner]], mixed his ''Berlin'' material with older numbers. Response to ''Berlin'' at the time of its release was generally negative, with ''Rolling Stone'' pronouncing it "a disaster".{{sfnp|Bockris|1994|p=221}} Reed found the poor reviews it received very disheartening.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8e40a4de-4245-11e3-bb85-00144feabdc0 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221210/https://www.ft.com/content/8e40a4de-4245-11e3-bb85-00144feabdc0 |archive-date=December 10, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Lou Reed: rock 'n' roll animal|last=Morley|first=Paul|date=November 1, 2013|work=[[Financial Times]]|access-date=February 17, 2018}}</ref> Since then the album has been critically reevaluated, and in 2003 ''Rolling Stone'' included it in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: 344.

Following the commercial disappointment of ''Berlin'', Reed befriended [[Steve Katz (musician)|Steve Katz]] of [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] (brother of his then-manager Dennis Katz), who suggested Reed put together a "great live band" and release a live album of Velvet Underground songs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bedfordandbowery.com/2013/10/he-treads-kind-of-softly-musicians-remember-working-with-lou-reed/|title='He Treads Kind of Softly': Two Musicians Remember Working with Lou Reed|date=October 28, 2013|website=Bedfordandbowery.com}}</ref> Katz would come on board as producer, and the album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Animal]]'' (February 1974) contained live performances of the Velvet Underground songs "Sweet Jane", "Heroin", "White Light/White Heat", and "Rock and Roll".

''[[Sally Can't Dance]]'' which was released later that year (in August 1974), became Reed's highest-charting album in the United States, peaking at No. 10 during a 14-week stay on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart in October 1974.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/lou-reed/chart-history/tlp/ |title=Sally Can't Dance Chart History |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=February 9, 2018 }}</ref>

In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Reed, based on Warhol's 1975 book, "''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol|The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again]]''", was reported to have been discovered in an archive at [[The Andy Warhol Museum]] in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.<ref name="NYT-20191030">{{cite news|last=Sisaro|first=Ben|title=A Long-Lost Lou Reed Tape with a Surprise: Andy Warhol Lyrics - The cassette, discovered at the Andy Warhol Museum, finds the Velvet Underground musician performing snippets from his mentor's 1975 book|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/arts/music/lou-reed-andy-warhol-tape.html|date=October 30, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 30, 2019}}</ref>

===1980–1989: Mid-period===
Reed's 1980 marriage to designer Sylvia Morales inspired Reed to write several songs, particularly "Think It Over" from 1980's ''[[Growing Up in Public (Lou Reed album)|Growing Up in Public]]''{{sfnp|Reed|1991|p=71}} and "Heavenly Arms" from 1982's ''[[The Blue Mask]]''. The latter album was enthusiastically received by critics such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Tom Carson, whose review began, "Lou Reed's ''The Blue Mask'' is a great record, and its genius is at once so simple and unusual that the only appropriate reaction is wonder.

Reed's 1984 album ''[[New Sensations]]'' marked the first time that Reed had charted within the US Top 100 since 1978's ''[[Street Hassle]]'', and the first time that Reed had charted in the UK altogether since 1976's ''[[Coney Island Baby]]''. Although its [[lead single]] "[[I Love You, Suzanne]]" only charted at No. 78 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] it did receive light rotation on [[MTV]]. Two more singles were released from the album: "[[My Red Joystick]]" and the Dutch-only release "[[High in the City]]" but they both failed to chart.

In 1998, ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that in the 1970s, Reed had a distinctive persona: "Back then he was publicly gay, pretended to shoot heroin onstage, and cultivated a 'Dachau panda' look, with cropped peroxide hair and black circles painted under his eyes."<ref name="Lewis">{{Cite news|last=Lewis|first=Randy|date= October 28, 2013|title= Lou Reed, 1942 - 2013 Influential pioneer of punk, art rock|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |page=1 |url=https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/la-me-lou-reed-20131028,0,347074.story?page=2 |access-date=December 7, 2013}}</ref> The newspaper wrote that in 1980, "Reed renounced druggy theatrics, even swore off intoxicants themselves, and became openly heterosexual, openly married."<ref name="Lewis"/>

On September 22, 1985, Reed performed at the first [[Farm Aid]] concert in [[Champaign, Illinois]]. He performed "Doin' the Things That We Want To", "I Love You, Suzanne", "New Sensations" and "Walk on the Wild Side" as his solo set. In June 1986, Reed released ''[[Mistrial (album)|Mistrial]]'' (co-produced with bassist [[Fernando Saunders]]). To support the album, he released two music videos: "[[No Money Down (Lou Reed song)|No Money Down]]" and "[[The Original Wrapper]]". In the same year, he joined [[Amnesty International]]'s [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] short tour and was outspoken about New York City's political issues and personalities. He also appeared on [[Steven Van Zandt]]'s 1985 [[Apartheid|anti-Apartheid]] song "[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]", pledging not to play at [[Sun City (South Africa)|that resort]].

The 1989 album ''[[New York (album)|New York]]'', which commented on crime, AIDS, civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]], then-President of Austria [[Kurt Waldheim]], and [[Pope John Paul II]], became his second gold-certified work when it passed 500,000 sales in 1997.<ref name="riaa"/> Reed was nominated for a Grammy Award for best male rock vocal performance for the album.<ref name="Caulfield"/>

==Artistry==
Reed's songwriting style has been described as "unusually literate" and often contained themes considered to be transgressive during the 1960s, namely drugs and sex. Reed was heavily influenced by literature and poetry, and strived to apply creative autonomy allowed in literature to rock music. He was known for the [[noise music|noisy]] nature of his lead guitar style.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Deming |first1=Mark |title=Lou Reed Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More &#124; |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lou-reed-mn0000233066#biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=November 18, 2024}}</ref>
