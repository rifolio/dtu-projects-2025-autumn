'''Yes''' are<!-- not "is"; British English is used for this article. See WP:ENGVAR for more info. --> an English [[progressive rock]] band formed in London in 1968. Comprising [[List of Yes band members|20 full-time musicians]] over their career, their most notable members include lead singer [[Jon Anderson]], bassist [[Chris Squire]], guitarists [[Steve Howe]] and [[Trevor Rabin]], drummers [[Bill Bruford]] and [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]], and keyboardists [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]] and [[Rick Wakeman]]. The band have explored several musical styles and are often regarded as progressive rock pioneers. Since February 2023, the band's line-up consists of Howe, keyboardist [[Geoff Downes]], bassist [[Billy Sherwood]], singer [[Jon Davison]], and drummer [[Jay Schellen]].

Founded by Anderson, Squire, Bruford, Kaye, and guitarist [[Peter Banks]], Yes began performing a mix of original songs and covers of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[blues]], and [[jazz]] songs, as showcased on their first two albums, ''[[Yes (Yes album)|Yes]]'' (1969) and ''[[Time and a Word]]'' (1970). A change of direction in 1970 after the replacement of Banks with Howe led to a series of successful progressive rock albums, with four consecutive US platinum or multi-platinum sellers: ''[[The Yes Album]]'' (1971); ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' (1971), which included the successful single "[[Roundabout (Yes song)|Roundabout]]"; ''[[Close to the Edge]]'' (1972); and the live album ''[[Yessongs]]'' (1973). Further albums ''[[Tales from Topographic Oceans]]'' (1973), ''[[Relayer]]'' (1974), ''[[Going for the One]]'' (1977), and ''[[Tormato]]'' (1978) were also commercially successful. Yes earned a reputation for their elaborate stage sets, light displays, and album covers designed by [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]]. During this time, Kaye and Bruford were replaced by Wakeman and White respectively, while keyboardist [[Patrick Moraz]] joined for ''Relayer'' and its subsequent tour. In 1980, growing musical differences led to Anderson and Wakeman's departures; Yes recruited Downes and singer [[Trevor Horn]] for the album ''[[Drama (Yes album)|Drama]]'' (1980) before disbanding in 1981.

In 1983, Squire, White, Anderson, and Kaye reformed Yes with Rabin joining. Rabin's songwriting moved the band toward a more pop-oriented sound, which resulted in their highest-selling album ''[[90125]]'' (1983) featuring the band's only US number-one single, "[[Owner of a Lonely Heart]]", and the successful follow-up album ''[[Big Generator]]'' (1987). In 1989, the offshoot group [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]] formed and released a [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (album)|self-titled album]]. At the suggestion of the record company, the groups merged into a short-lived eight-piece line-up for ''[[Union (Yes album)|Union]]'' (1991) and its tour. Yes regularly released studio albums from 1994 to 2001 with varying levels of success, beginning a second hiatus in 2004. After a 2008 world tour was cancelled, Yes enlisted [[Benoît David]] as the new lead singer, then Davison in 2012. Squire died in 2015, leaving the band with no original members. White, the longest-tenured member at that point, died in 2022. Former members [[Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman|Anderson, Rabin, and Wakeman toured]] from 2016 to 2018. Yes's latest album, ''[[Mirror to the Sky]]'', was released in 2023.

Yes are one of the most successful, influential, and longest-lasting progressive rock bands. Their [[Yes discography|discography]] spans 23 studio albums, with 13.5 million [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)-certified albums sold in the US<ref name=riaatotal>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=top_tallies&ttt=TAA#search_section|title=Top Selling Artists|publisher=RIAA|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> and more than 30 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yesworld.com/discography/yes-the-studio-albums-1969-1987/|title=Yes the Studio Albums 1969–1987|publisher=yesworld|access-date=25 November 2021}}</ref> In 1985, they won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] with "[[Cinema (Yes song)|Cinema]]". They were ranked No. 94 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxm64mApR05CJVCePlmcUFluSZyiAvKZ8|title=VH1 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock|publisher=YouTube|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> In April 2017, Yes—represented by Anderson, Bruford, Kaye, Howe, Wakeman, White, and Rabin, with Squire honored posthumously—were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

In late 1967, bassist [[Chris Squire]] and guitarist [[Peter Banks]], both formerly of [[the Syn]], joined the [[psychedelic rock]] band [[Mabel Greer's Toyshop]], which had been formed in 1966 by Clive Bayley and Robert Hagger.<ref name=Loudersound2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/mabel-greer-s-toyshop-reunite|title=Mabel Greer's Toyshop reunite|publisher=Loudersound|date=13 November 2014|first=Scott|last=Munro|access-date=13 July 2024}}</ref><ref name=ZM2015>{{cite web|url=https://zacharymule.com/wp/?p=2458|title=Yes-terday and Today: An interview with Mabel Greer's Toyshop about their surprising comeback and some "unfinished business"|first=Kevin|last=Renick|date=7 February 2015|publisher=Zacharymule|access-date=12 July 2024}}</ref> They played at the [[Marquee Club]] in [[Soho]], London where Jack Barrie, owner of the nearby La Chasse club, saw them perform.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=23}} He later recalled: "the musicianship was very good but it was obvious they weren't going anywhere".{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=23}} Barrie introduced Squire to singer [[Jon Anderson]], a worker at the bar in La Chasse, who found they shared interests in [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and harmony singing. That evening they wrote "Sweetness", which was included on the first Yes album, and Anderson joined as lead vocalist.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=24}} During this time, the band rehearsed in the basement of The Lucky Horseshoe cafe on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] between 10 June and 9 July 1968.{{sfn|Bruford|2009|p=35}}{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=39}}{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=44}} In June 1968, Hagger was replaced by [[Bill Bruford]], who had placed an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'',{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=33-34}}{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=37}} while in July the classically trained organist and pianist [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]], of Johnny Taylor's Star Combo and the Federals, became the keyboardist.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=38}} Meanwhile, Banks had left Mabel Greer's Toyshop to join Neat Change, but he was dismissed by this group on 14 July 1968{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=33-34}} and was recalled by Squire, replacing Bayley as guitarist.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=33-34}}

Having considered the experience of Mabel Greer's Toyshop concluded, the group exchanged ideas for a new name.

After seeing an early [[King Crimson]] gig in 1969, Yes realised that there was suddenly stiff competition on the London gigging circuit, and they needed to be much more technically proficient, starting regular rehearsals.<ref name="banks">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sjxnnx-jqU |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/8Sjxnnx-jqU| archive-date=11 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=Interview with Peter Banks by Mark Powell|date=7 April 2010 |publisher=[[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red TV]]|access-date=21 September 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref> They subsequently signed a deal with [[Atlantic Records]], and, that August, released their debut album ''[[Yes (Yes album)|Yes]]''.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=315}} Compiled of mostly original material, the record includes renditions of "[[Every Little Thing (Beatles song)|Every Little Thing]]" by the Beatles and "I See You" by [[The Byrds]].

''[[Tales from Topographic Oceans]]'' was the band's sixth studio album, released on 7 December 1973.<ref>[https://www.bpi.co.uk/brit-certified "BRIT Certified – bpi"], search "Tales from Topographic Oceans"</ref> It marked a change in their fortunes and polarised fans and critics alike. The double vinyl set was based on Anderson's interpretation of the [[Shastra|Shastric]] scriptures from a footnote within [[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s book ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]''. The album became the first LP in the UK to ship gold before the record arrived at retailers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQkEAAAAMBAJ|title=Yes LP Breaks Ground in U.K.|date=15 December 1973|magazine=Billboard|page=42|access-date=11 February 2012}}</ref> It went on to [[List of UK Albums Chart number ones of the 1970s#1974|top the UK charts]] for two weeks<ref name=officialchartsuk/> while reaching number 6 in the US,<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> and became the band's fourth consecutive gold album.

=== 1974–1980: ''Relayer'', ''Going for the One'', ''Tormato'' and the Paris sessions ===
Several musicians were approached to replace Wakeman, including [[Vangelis Papathanassiou]], [[Eddie Jobson]] of [[Roxy Music]] and former Atlantis/Cat Stevens keyboardist [[Jean Roussel]]. Howe says he also asked [[Keith Emerson]], who did not want to leave [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]].{{sfn|Howe|2021|p=108}} Yes ultimately chose Swiss keyboardist [[Patrick Moraz]] of [[Refugee (band)|Refugee]], who arrived in August 1974<ref>{{cite news |title= News Briefs |magazine=Billboard |date=31 August 1974}}</ref> during the recording sessions for ''[[Relayer]]'', which took place at Squire's home in [[Virginia Water]], Surrey. Released in November that year, ''Relayer'' showcased a [[jazz fusion]]-influenced direction the band were pursuing. The album features the 22-minute track titled "[[The Gates of Delirium]]", which highlights a battle initially inspired by ''[[War and Peace]]'' by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Its closing section, "Soon", was subsequently released as a single. The album reached No. 4 in the UK<ref name=officialchartsuk/> and No. 5 in the US<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/>{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=154}} Yes embarked on their [[List of Yes concert tours (1960s–70s)#Relayer Tour|1974–1975 tour]] to support ''Relayer''. The compilation album ''[[Yesterdays (Yes album)|Yesterdays]]'', released in 1975, contained tracks from Yes's first two albums, the B-side track from their "Sweet Dreams" single from 1970 titled "Dear Father", and the original ten-minute version of their cover of "America".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Relayer & Yesterdays|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=Ken|last=Barnes|date=19 June 1975}}</ref>

Between 1975 and 1976, each member of the band released a solo album. Their subsequent [[List of Yes concert tours (1960s–70s)#1976 Solo Albums Tour|1976 tour]] of North America with [[Peter Frampton]] featured some of the band's most-attended shows. The show of 12 June, also supported by [[Gary Wright]] and [[Pousette-Dart Band]] at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in Philadelphia, attracted over 100,000 people.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yestour '76 – Laser Show Intrigues Audiences|work=Circus Magazine|date=13 September 1976|author=Peter Crescenti}}</ref>

In late 1976, the band travelled to Switzerland and started recording for their album ''[[Going for the One]]'' at [[Mountain Studios]], [[Montreux]]. It was then that Anderson sent early versions of "Going for the One" and "[[Wonderous Stories]]" to Wakeman, who felt he could contribute to such material better than the band's past releases. Moraz was let go, after Wakeman was booked initially on a session musician basis, before being convinced by Squire to re-join the band full time.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Yesyears documentary 1991}}</ref> Upon its release in July 1977, ''Going for the One'' [[List of number-one albums from the 1970s (UK)#1977|topped]] the UK album charts for two weeks<ref name=officialchartsuk/> and reached number 8 in the US<ref name="allmusicalbumchart"/>{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=166}} "[[Wonderous Stories]]" and "Going for the One" were released as singles in the UK and reached numbers 7 and 25, respectively.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=166}} Although the album's cover was designed by [[Hipgnosis]], it still features their Roger Dean [[Yes bubble logo|"bubble" logotype]]. The band's [[List of Yes concert tours (1960s–70s)#Going for the One Tour|1977 tour]] spanned across six months.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

''[[Tormato]]'' was released in September 1978 at the height of [[punk rock]] in England, during which the music press criticised Yes as representing the bloated excesses of early-1970s progressive rock. The album saw the band continuing their movement towards shorter songs; no track runs longer than eight minutes.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Yes Decade|date=17 October 1978|website=Circus Magazine|first=Kurt|last=Loder}}</ref> Wakeman replaced his Mellotrons with the [[Birotron]], a [[sampler (musical instrument)|tape replay keyboard]], and Squire experimented with harmonisers and [[Mu-tron]] pedals with his bass. Production was handled collectively by the band and saw disagreements at the mixing stage among the members. With heavy commercial rock-radio airplay, the album reached number 8 in the UK<ref name=officialchartsuk/> and number 10 in the US charts, and was also certified platinum (1 million copies sold) by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="allmusicalbumchart"/> Despite internal and external criticisms of the album, the band's [[List of Yes concert tours (1960s–70s)#Tormato Tour|1978–1979 tour]] was a commercial success. Concerts were performed [[Theatre in the round|in the round]] with a £50,000 revolving stage and a 360-degree sound system fitted above it. Their dates at [[Madison Square Garden]] earned Yes a [[Madison Square Garden Gold Ticket Award|Golden Ticket Award]] for grossing over $1 million in box office receipts.{{sfn|Wooding|1978|p=197}}

In October 1979, the band convened in Paris with producer [[Roy Thomas Baker]]. At the time, Anderson and Wakeman favoured a more fantastical and delicate approach while the rest preferred a heavier rock sound. Howe, Squire and White liked none of the music Anderson was offering at the time as they felt it was too lightweight and lacking in the heaviness that they were generating in their own writing sessions. The Paris sessions abruptly ended in December after White broke his foot while rollerskating in a [[roller disco]].<ref name="lithiummagazine.com 21 March 2014">{{cite web|url=http://lithiummagazine.com/interview-chris-squire-yes-march-19-2014|title=An Interview with Chris Squire of YES – March 19, 2014|work=Lithium Magazine|date=21 March 2014|access-date=22 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030334/http://lithiummagazine.com/interview-chris-squire-yes-march-19-2014|archive-date=22 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

When the band, minus Wakeman (who had only committed to recording keyboard overdubs once new material would be ready to record), reconvened in February to resume work on the project, their growing musical differences, combined with internal dissension, obstructed progress. Journalist Chris Welch, after attending a rehearsal, noted that Anderson "was singing without his usual conviction and seemed disinclined to talk".<ref>Welch, Musicians Only, 14 June 1980, p. 5.</ref> By late March, Howe, Squire and White had begun demoing material as an instrumental trio, increasingly uncertain about Anderson's future involvement. Eventually, a serious band dispute over finance saw Anderson leave Yes, with a dispirited Wakeman departing at around the same time.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

=== 1980–1981: ''Drama'' and split ===
In 1980, pop duo [[The Buggles]] (singer [[Trevor Horn]] and keyboardist [[Geoff Downes]]) secured the services of [[Brian Lane (manager)|Brian Lane]], who had managed Yes since 1970, as their manager. The Buggles were best known for their 1979 hit single "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]" from their album ''[[The Age of Plastic]]''. At this point, the departure of Anderson and Wakeman had been kept secret from everyone outside the Yes inner circle. Seeing an option of continuing the band with new creative input and expertise, Squire revealed the situation to Horn and Downes and suggested that they join Yes as full-time members. Horn and Downes accepted the invitation and the reconfigured band recorded the ''[[Drama (Yes album)|Drama]]'' album, which was released in August 1980. The record displayed a heavier, harder sound than the material Yes recorded with Anderson and Wakeman in 1979, opening with the lengthy hard rocker "[[Machine Messiah]]". The album received substantial radio airplay in the late summer–fall of 1980, and peaked at number 2 in the UK<ref name=officialchartsuk/> and number 18 in the US, though it was the first Yes album to not be certified Gold by the RIAA since 1971.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> Their [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Drama Tour|1980 tour]] of North America and the UK received a mixed reaction from audiences. They were well received in the United States and were awarded with a commemorative certificate after they performed a record 16 consecutive sold-out concerts at Madison Square Garden since 1974.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=197}}

After the ''Drama'' tour, Yes reconvened in England to decide the band's next step, beginning by dismissing Lane as their manager. Horn was also dismissed,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horn |first1=Trevor |title=Adventures in Modern Recording |date=2022 |publisher=Nine Eight Books |location=UK |isbn=978-1-7887-0603-2 |page=95}}</ref> and went on to pursue a career in music production, with White and Squire next to depart. Left as the sole remaining members, Downes and Howe opted not to continue with the group and went their own separate ways in December 1980.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

''[[Yesshows]]'', a live album recorded during 1976 to 1978, mixed in mid-1979 and originally intended for release in late 1979, was released in November 1980, peaking at number 22 in the UK charts<ref name=officialchartsuk/> and number 43 in the US.<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/>

An announcement came from the group's management in March 1981 confirming that Yes no longer existed. Downes and Howe soon reunited to form [[Asia (band)|Asia]] with former [[King Crimson]] bassist and vocalist [[John Wetton]], and drummer [[Carl Palmer]] from [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]]. Squire and White continued to work together, initially recording sessions with [[Jimmy Page]] for a proposed band called [[XYZ (UK band)|XYZ]] (short for "ex-Yes-and-Zeppelin") in the spring of 1981. Page's former bandmate [[Robert Plant]] was also to be involved as the vocalist but he lost enthusiasm, citing his ongoing grieving for recently deceased Led Zeppelin drummer [[John Bonham]]. The short-lived group produced a few demo tracks, elements of which would appear in Page's band the Firm and on future Yes tracks "Mind Drive" and "Can You Imagine?". In late 1981, Squire and White released "[[Run with the Fox]]", a Christmas single with Squire on vocals which received radio airplay through the 1980s and early 1990s during the Christmas periods. A second Yes compilation album, ''[[Classic Yes]],'' was released in November 1981.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

=== 1982–1988: First reformation, ''90125'' and ''Big Generator'' ===
At the beginning of 1982, [[Phil Carson]] of Atlantic Records introduced Squire and White to guitarist and singer [[Trevor Rabin]], who had initially made his name with the South African supergroup [[Rabbitt]], subsequently releasing three solo albums, working as a record producer and even briefly considered being a member of [[Asia (band)|Asia]]. The three teamed up in a new band called [[Cinema (band)|Cinema]], for which Squire also recruited the original Yes keyboard player Tony Kaye. Later in 1982, Cinema entered the studio to record their debut album. Although Rabin and Squire initially shared lead vocals for the project, Trevor Horn was briefly brought into Cinema as a potential singer,<ref name="innerviewsrabin2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.innerviews.org/inner/rabin.html|title=Trevor Rabin – Capturing adrenaline |publisher=Innerviews.org|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> but soon opted to become the band's producer instead.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

Horn worked well with the band. However, his clashes with Tony Kaye (complicated by the fact that Rabin was playing most of the keyboards during the recording sessions) led to Kaye's departure during the recording, though some of his playing was kept on the final album and he had returned by the time it was released.<ref name=innerviewsrabin2004/> Meanwhile, Squire encountered Jon Anderson (who, since leaving Yes, had released two solo albums and had success with the [[Jon and Vangelis]] project) at a Los Angeles party and, encouraged by Atlantic Records vice-president [[Phil Carson]], played Anderson the Cinema demo tracks. Anderson was then invited into the project as lead singer and joined in April 1983 during the last few weeks of the sessions, having comparatively little creative input beyond adding his lead vocals and re-writing some lyrics.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

At the suggestion of Carson and other Atlantic executives, Cinema then changed their name to Yes in June 1983. Rabin initially objected to this, as he now found that he had inadvertently joined a reunited band with a history and expectations, rather than help launch a new group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoremagacine.com/Entrevistas_eng_det.php?Codigo=19|title=Web dedicada a la Música de Cine y Bandas Sonoras|publisher=ScoreMagacine.com|date=22 September 2005|access-date=22 September 2017|archive-date=5 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230705221320/http://www.scoremagacine.com/Entrevistas_eng_det.php?Codigo=19|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, with four of the five members having been members of Yes (with three of them being original members, including the distinctive lead singer) it suggested that the name change was sound commercial strategy. The new album marked a significant change in style as the revived Yes had adopted more of a [[pop rock]] sound with few moments that recalled their progressive rock past. This incarnation of the band has sometimes been informally referred to as "Yes-West", reflecting the band's new base in Los Angeles rather than London.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

[[File:Trevor Rabin July 2017.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Trevor Rabin in 2017]]
Yes released their comeback album ''[[90125]]'' (named after its catalogue serial number on [[Atco Records]]) in November 1983. It became their biggest-selling album, certified by the [[RIAA]] at triple-platinum (3 million copies) in sales in the US, and introduced the band to younger fans. "Owner of a Lonely Heart" [[List of number-one mainstream rock hits (United States)|topped]] the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart for four weeks and went on to reach the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1984|number-one spot]] on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart, the only single from Yes to do so,<ref name=allmusicsinglechart/> for two weeks in January 1984. Kaye's short-term replacement on keyboards, [[Eddie Jobson]], appeared briefly in the original video but was edited out as much as possible once Kaye had been persuaded to return to the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yesfans.com/archive/index.php/t-36085.html|title=Why I did not join Yes – by Eddie Jobson [Archive&#93; – Yesfans.com: The place for YES fans since 2001|publisher=Yesfans.com|date=20 February 2004|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref>

Yes began recording for their twelfth album, ''[[Big Generator]]'', in 1985, initially with Trevor Horn returning as producer. The sessions underwent many starts and stops due to the use of multiple recording locations in Italy, London and Los Angeles, with interpersonal problems leading to Horn leaving the sessions partway through, all of which kept the album from timely completion (the album was intended for a 1986 release, but by the end of that year it was still incomplete).<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Yesyears documentary 1991|quote=Chris Squire on Big Generator: "It was supposed to come out a year before it did, which would've been better timing"}}</ref> Eventually Rabin took over final production.

=== 1988–1995: ''Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe'', ''Union'' and ''Talk'' ===
By the end of 1988, Anderson felt creatively sidelined by Rabin and Squire and had grown tired of the musical direction of the "Yes-West" line-up. He took leave of the band, asserting that he would never stay in Yes purely for the money, and started work in [[Montserrat]] on a solo project that eventually involved Wakeman, Howe and Bruford. This collaboration led to suggestions that there would be some kind of reformation of the "classic" Yes, although from the start the project had included bass player [[Tony Levin]], whom Bruford had worked with in King Crimson. The project, rather than taking over or otherwise using the Yes name, was called [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]] (ABWH).{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

Their [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (album)|eponymous album]], released in June 1989, featured "Brother of Mine", which became an MTV hit and went gold in the United States. It later emerged that the four band members had not all recorded together; Anderson and producer [[Chris Kimsey]] slotted their parts into place. Howe has stated publicly that he was unhappy with the mix of his guitars on the album,<ref name="Innerviews">{{cite web|url=http://www.innerviews.org/inner/howe2.html|title=Steve Howe – Into the storm|publisher=Innerviews|year=2012|access-date=22 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723040600/http://www.innerviews.org/inner/howe2.html|archive-date=23 July 2015}}</ref> though a version of "Fist of Fire" with more of Howe's guitars left intact appeared on the ''[[In a Word: Yes (1969-)|In a Word: Yes]]'' box set in 2002. ABWH toured in [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe Tour|1989 and 1990]] as "An Evening of Yes Music" which featured Levin, keyboardist [[Julian Colbeck]], and guitarist [[Milton McDonald]] as support musicians. A live album and home video were recorded and released in 1993, both titled ''[[An Evening of Yes Music Plus]]'' that featured [[Jeff Berlin]] on bass due to Levin suffering from illness. The tour was also dogged by legal battles sparked by Atlantic Records due to the band's references to Yes in promotional materials and the tour title.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

Following the tour, the group returned to the recording studio to produce their second album, tentatively called ''Dialogue''. After hearing the tracks, [[Arista Records]] refused to release the album as they felt the initial mixes were weak.<ref>Chambers 2002, p. 112</ref> They encouraged the group to seek outside songwriters, preferably ones who could help them deliver hit singles. Anderson approached Rabin about the situation, and Rabin sent Anderson a demo tape with three songs, indicating that ABWH could have one but had to send the others back. Arista listened to them and wanted all of them, proposing to create a combined album with both Yes factions.<ref>Chambers 2002, p. 112-113</ref>

Meanwhile, the "Yes-West" group had been working on a follow-up to ''Big Generator'' and had been shopping around for a new singer, auditioning [[Roger Hodgson]] of [[Supertramp]], [[Steve Walsh (musician)|Steve Walsh]] of [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[Billy Sherwood]] of [[World Trade (band)|World Trade]] and solo pop/dance singer [[Robbie Nevil]] (who'd scored a US #2 hit in 1986 with "[[C'est la Vie (Robbie Nevil song)|C'est la Vie]]").<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/30492578/|title=Yes: a weird return of '70s once-weres and '80s wanna-bes|first=Roger|last=Catlin|page=4|date=18 April 1991|newspaper=Hartford Courant|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-access=subscription|access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref> Walsh only spent one day with the band, but Sherwood and Squire quickly established a rapport and continued with writing sessions, although Sherwood ultimately chose not to formally join the group or become the lead singer. Arista now suggested that the "Yes-West" group, with Anderson on vocals, record the songs from Rabin's demo tape and add them to the incomplete ABWH album, which would then be released as a full album under the Yes name.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

''[[Union (Yes album)|Union]]'' was released in April 1991 and is the thirteenth studio album from Yes. Each group played their own songs, with Anderson singing on all tracks. Squire sang background vocals on a few of the ABWH tracks, with Tony Levin playing all the bass on those songs. The album does not feature all eight members playing at once. The track "Masquerade" earned Yes a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1992.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19920108&slug=1469119|title=Grammy Nominations Span Streisand, Seal, Seattle Symphony|date=8 January 1992|access-date=12 February 2011|website=[[The Seattle Times]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]}}</ref> Howe described the nomination for a track he had recorded solo at home as "pure justice", following the difficulties in making the album.{{sfn|Morse|1996|p=91}} ''Union'' sold approximately 1.5&nbsp;million copies worldwide, and peaked at number 7 in the UK<ref name=officialchartsuk/> and number 15 in the US charts.<ref name="allmusicalbumchart"/> Two singles from the album were released.

Almost the entire band have openly stated their dislike of ''Union''.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=324–325}} Bruford has disowned the album entirely, and Wakeman was reportedly unable to recognise any of his keyboard work in the final edit and threw his copy of the album out of his limousine.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=420}} He has since referred to the album as "Onion" because it makes him cry when he thinks about it. ''Union'' co-producer [[Jonathan Elias]] later stated publicly in an interview that Anderson, as the associate producer, knew of the session musicians' involvement. He added that he and Anderson had even initiated their contributions, because hostility between some of the band members at the time was preventing work from being accomplished.<ref>{{cite web|author=Henry Potts|url=http://www.bondegezou.co.uk/iv/jeinterview.htm|title=Bondegezou.co.uk|publisher=Bondegezou.co.uk|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> The [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Union Tour|1991–1992 Union tour]] united all eight members on a revolving circular stage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sutcliffe|first=Phil|date=5 March 1991|title=Stories|journal=Q Magazine|volume=55|pages=12–13}}</ref> Following the tour's conclusion in 1992, Bruford chose not to remain involved with Yes and returned to his jazz project ''[[Earthworks (album)|Earthworks]]''. Howe also ceased his involvement with the band at this time. In August 1991, while the ''Union'' tour was underway, Atlantic released ''[[Yesyears]]'', a four-CD box set anthology. Two accompanying home videos, ''[[Yesyears (video)|Yesyears]]'' and ''[[Greatest Video Hits (Yes video)|Greatest Video Hits]]'', were also released during 1991.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

In 1993, the album ''[[Symphonic Music of Yes]]'' was released, featuring orchestrated Yes tracks arranged by [[Dee Palmer]]. Howe, Bruford and Anderson perform on the record, joined by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[English Chamber Orchestra]] and the [[London Community Gospel Choir]]. Howe and Bruford performed together on television (presented as "Yes") to promote the album, marking Bruford's final performance under the Yes name before retiring from performing.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ewingpublished |first=Jerry |date=10 August 2022 |title=Revisiting the car-crash moment Yes inadvertently performed as a power trio on live TV |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/revisiting-the-car-crash-moment-yes-inadvertently-performed-as-a-power-trio-on-live-tv |website=loudersound |language=en}}</ref>

The next Yes studio album, as with ''Union'', was masterminded by a record company, rather than by the band itself.{{sfn|Welch|2008|p=336}} Victory Music approached Rabin with a proposal to produce an album solely with the ''90125'' line-up. Rabin initially countered by requesting that Wakeman also be included. Rabin began assembling the album at his home, using the then-pioneering concept of a digital home studio, and used material written by himself and Anderson.<ref>{{Cite web |last=DeRiso |first=Nick |date=10 May 2014 |title=Trevor Rabin and Jon Anderson on Yes' Most Overlooked Album |url=https://somethingelsereviews.com/2014/05/10/it-was-a-perfect-storm-trevor-rabin-and-jon-anderson-remember-yes-most-overlooked-album/ |access-date=9 October 2022 |website=Something Else! |language=en-US}}</ref> The new album was well into production in 1993, but Wakeman's involvement had finally been cancelled, as his refusal to leave his long-serving management created insuperable legal problems.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

''[[Talk (Yes album)|Talk]]'' was released in March 1994 and is the band's fourteenth studio release. Its cover was designed by [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Max]]. The record was largely composed and performed by Rabin, with the other band members following Rabin's tracks for their respective instrumentation.<ref name=ultimateclassicrock>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/yes-talk/|author=Jeff Giles|title=Revisiting Yes' Confused 1994 Album, 'Talk'|date=21 March 2014|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> It was digitally recorded and produced by Rabin with engineer Michael Jay, using 3.4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of hard disk storage split among four networked [[Apple Macintosh]] computers running [[Digital Performer]]. The album blended elements of radio-friendly rock with a more structurally ambitious approach taken from the band's progressive blueprint, with the fifteen-minute track "[[Endless Dream (Yes song)|Endless Dream]]".

The [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Talk Tour|1994 tour]] (for which the band employed Billy Sherwood as a support musician on additional guitar, bass, vocals and keyboards) used a sound system developed by Rabin named Concertsonics which allowed the audience located in certain seating areas to tune portable FM radios to a specific frequency, so they could hear the concert with headphones.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/1994/08/05/yes-mines-cutting-edge-of-sound/|date=5 August 1994|author=Parry Gettelman|work=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=22 September 2017|title=Yes Mines Cutting Edge Of Sound}}</ref>

In early 1995, following the tour, disagreements and dissatisfactions forced another change in the band. 1990s Yes manager Jon Brewer has stated that Squire had not appreciated the ''Talk'' production process: "(he) didn't like that. He didn't think it was what Yes was all about; he was very much against a computerised, digital sound at that time. So Trevor and Chris moved away from one another for quite a while."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hughes |first1=Rob |title=Former Manager And Friend Jon Brewer Remembers Chris Squire |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/former-manager-and-friend-jon-brewer-remembers-chris-squire |access-date=15 May 2024 |work=[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]] |date=28 September 2015}}</ref> For his part, Rabin felt that he had achieved his highest ambitions with ''Talk'' and lamented its disappointing reception, feeling that this was due to the fact that it "just wasn't what people wanted to hear at the time." Having remarked at the conclusion of the tour "I think I'm done", Rabin quit the band and returned to Los Angeles, where he shifted his focus to composing for films.<ref name=ultimateclassicrock/> Kaye also left Yes to pursue other projects.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

=== 1995–2000: ''Keys to Ascension'', ''Open Your Eyes'' and ''The Ladder'' ===
In November 1995, Anderson, Squire and White resurrected the "classic" 1970s line-up of Yes by inviting Wakeman and Howe back to the band, recording two new lengthy tracks called "Be the One" and "That, That Is". In March 1996 Yes performed three live shows at the [[Fremont Theater]] in [[San Luis Obispo]], California which were recorded and released, along with the new studio tracks, that October on [[CMC International]] Records as the ''[[Keys to Ascension]]'' album, which peaked at number 48 in the UK<ref name=officialchartsuk/> and number 99 in the US<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> A same-titled [[Keys to Ascension (video)|live video]] of the shows was also released that year.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

Yes continued to record new tracks in the studio, drawing some material written around the time of the XYZ project. At one point the new songs were to be released as a studio album, but commercial considerations meant that the new tracks were eventually packaged with the remainder of the 1996 San Luis Obispo shows in November 1997 on ''[[Keys to Ascension 2]]''. The record managed to reach number 62 in the UK,<ref name=officialchartsuk/> but failed to chart in the US<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> Disgruntled at the way a potential studio album had been sacrificed in favour of the ''Keys to Ascension'' releases (as well as the way in which a Yes tour was being arranged without his input or agreement), Wakeman left the group again. (The studio material from both albums would eventually be compiled and re-released without the live tracks onto a single CD, 2001's ''[[Keystudio]]''.){{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

With Yes in disarray again, Squire turned to Billy Sherwood (by now the band's engineer) for help.<ref name=se-sherwood102013>{{cite news|url=http://news.allaboutjazz.com/something-else-interview-billy-sherwood-formerly-of-yes.php#.VHNWNrFFDVU|title=Something Else! Interview: Billy Sherwood, Formerly of Yes|publisher=News.allaboutjazz.com|date=13 October 2011|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> Both men had been working on a side project called [[Conspiracy (band)|Conspiracy]] and reworked existing demos and recordings from there to turn them into Yes songs, and also worked on new material with Anderson and White. (Howe's involvement at this stage was minimal, mainly taking place towards the end of the sessions.) Sherwood's integral involvement with the writing, production, and performance of the music led to his finally joining Yes as a full member (taking on the role of harmony singer, keyboardist and second guitarist).{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

The results of the sessions were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, ''[[Open Your Eyes (Yes album)|Open Your Eyes]]'' (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="se-sherwood102013"/> (Sherwood: "My goal was to try to break down those partisan walls…&nbsp;For that, I am proud—to have aligned planets for a moment in time."<ref name="se-sherwood102013"/>) However, ''Open Your Eyes'' was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the ''Billboard'' 200<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> but failed to enter the charts in the UK. The [[Open Your Eyes (Yes song)|title single]] managed to reach number 33 on the mainstream rock chart.<ref name=allmusicsinglechart/>

For the [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#Open Your Eyes and Thirtieth Anniversary Tour|1997/1998 ''Open Your Eyes'' tour]], Yes hired Russian keyboard player [[Igor Khoroshev]], who had played on some of the album tracks. Significantly, the tour setlist featured only a few pieces from the new album, and mostly concentrated on earlier material. Anderson and Howe, who had been less involved with the writing and production on ''Open Your Eyes'' than they'd wished, would express dissatisfaction about the album later.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

By the time the band came to record their eighteenth studio album ''[[The Ladder (Yes album)|The Ladder]]'' with producer [[Bruce Fairbairn]], Khoroshev had become a full-time member (with Sherwood now concentrating on songwriting, vocal arrangements and second guitar). With Khoroshev's classically influenced keyboard style, and with all members now making more or less equal writing contributions, the band's sound found a balance between its eclectic 1970s progressive rock style and the more polished pop sound sought on the previous album. ''The Ladder'' also featured Latin music ingredients and clear world music influences, mostly brought in by Alan White (although Fairbairn's multi-instrumentalist colleague [[Randy Raine-Reusch]] made a strong contribution to the album's textures). One of the album tracks, "Homeworld (The Ladder)", was written for Relic Entertainment's [[Homeworld]], a real-time strategy computer game, and was used as the credits and outro theme. Pleased with the result of the album's creation, the band had been in tentative discussions to continue work with Fairbairn on future projects, but he died suddenly during the final mixing sessions of the album.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Morse|first=Tim|date=March 2000|title=Chris Squire Still Climbing|magazine=Bass Player|url=https://yesinthepress.com/2000/mar/mar_00.html|location= |publisher= |access-date=30 May 2023}}</ref>

''The Ladder'' was released in September 1999, peaking at number 36 in the UK<ref name=officialchartsuk/> and number 99 in the US<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> While [[List of Yes concert tours (1980s–90s)#The Ladder Tour|on tour in 1999 and early 2000]], Yes recorded their performance at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on 31 October 1999, releasing it in September 2000 as a live album and DVD called ''[[House of Yes: Live from House of Blues]]''. As Sherwood saw his role in Yes as creating and performing new music, and the rest of the band now wished to concentrate on performing the back catalogue, he amicably resigned from Yes at the end of the tour.<ref name="se-sherwood102013"/>

In summer 2000, Yes embarked on the three-month [[List of Yes concert tours (2000s–10s)#Masterworks Tour|Masterworks tour]] of the United States, on which they performed only material which had been released between 1970 and 1974 (''The Yes Album'' through to ''Relayer'').

=== 2001–2008: ''Magnification'', Anniversary touring, and Anderson's departure ===
Following the departures of Sherwood and Khoroshev and the death of Fairbairn, Yes once again set about reinventing themselves, this time choosing to record without a keyboardist, opting instead to include a 60-piece orchestra conducted by [[Larry Groupé]]; the first time the band used an orchestra since ''Time and a Word'' in 1970. The result was their nineteenth studio album, 2001's ''[[Magnification (album)|Magnification]]''. The record was not a chart success; it peaked at number 71 in the UK<ref name=officialchartsuk/> and number 186 in the US<ref name=allmusicalbumchart/> The Yes Symphonic Tour ran from July to December 2001 and had the band performing on stage with an orchestra and American keyboardist [[Tom Brislin]]. Their two shows in Amsterdam, in November, were recorded for their 2002 DVD and 2009 CD release ''[[Symphonic Live]]''. The band invited Wakeman to play with them for the filming, but he was on a solo tour at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfte.org/interviews/rw263.html|title=Conversation with Rick Wakeman|first=Mike|last=Tiano|publisher=Notes from the Edge|date=14 July 2002|access-date=9 December 2017}}</ref>

Following Wakeman's announcement of his return in April 2002, Yes embarked on their [[List of Yes concert tours (2000s–10s)#Full Circle Tour|Full Circle Tour]] in 2002–2003 that included their first performances in Australia since 1973.<ref name="billboard03">{{cite magazine|title=''Billboard'' Spotlight: Yes 35th Anniversary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0REEAAAAMBAJ|magazine=Billboard|date=1 November 2003|pages=45–46, 48–50, 55–59|publisher=Nielsen Business Media Inc}}</ref> The band's appearance in [[Montreux]] on this tour was documented on the album and DVD ''[[Live at Montreux 2003]]'', released in 2007.

On 26 January 2004, the film ''[[Yesspeak]]'' premiered in a number of select theatres, followed by a closed-circuit live acoustic performance of the group. Both ''Yesspeak'' and the acoustic performance, titled ''[[Yes Acoustic: Guaranteed No Hiss]]'', were released on DVD later that year. A [[List of Yes concert tours (2000s–10s)#35th Anniversary Tour|35th anniversary tour]] followed in 2004 which was documented on the DVD ''[[Songs from Tsongas]]'', released in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yes, 'Songs From Tsongas' – DVD Review |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/yes-songs-from-tsongas/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=8 October 2014 }}</ref> After their 35th Anniversary Tour, Yes described themselves as "on hiatus".{{sfn|Howe|2021|p=227-28,234}}

== Musical style and influences ==
Music critics [[Jim DeRogatis]] and [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] cite Yes as the "definitive English [[progressive rock]] band," and as "epitomizing" the genre. Erlewine credited the band with bringing the genre to [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|mainstream]] audiences. He described the band's early sound as an amalgamation of "pastoral [[Folk music|folk]]", "[[Baroque music|Baroque]] classical" and "muscular [[Rock and roll|rock & roll]]". He also noted that the band's compositions utilised odd [[time signature]]s, and were "structured like mini-suites." He described some of the band's later output as "steely, shiny [...] [[album-oriented rock]]."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yes Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/yes-mn0000685647#biography |access-date=19 December 2024 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref> Chris Roberts of ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' said Yes "pioneered 70s progressive and [[symphonic rock]], and dominated 80s stadium pop-rock."<ref>{{Cite web |date=30 June 2020 |first=Chris |last=Roberts |title=How Yes ruled the 1970s |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/how-yes-helped-shape-the-1970s |access-date=24 June 2025 |website=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]}}</ref> Yes have also been described as an [[art rock]] group.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pete Prown|last2=HP Newquist|title=Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|quote= ...

[[Jon Anderson]], who served as the original lead vocalist and co-founder of Yes, said that the band incorporated elements of [[progressive music]], [[Orchestra|symphonic music]], [[jazz]], [[Jazz fusion|fusion]], and [[world music]] into their material. He mentioned that the classical composition structure inspired him to craft longer pieces of music and cited the works of Russian composer [[Igor Stravinsky]], Finnish composer [[Jean Sibelius]] and English composer [[Gustav Holst]] (namely "[[The Planets]]") as some of the band's influences.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Spacek |first=Nick |date=1 September 2017|title=Yes co-founder Jon Anderson on the band's history and influences |url=https://www.thepitchkc.com/yes-cofounder-jon-anderson-on-the-bands-history-and-influences/ |access-date=20 March 2025 |website=The Pitch |language=en-US}}</ref> Anderson has also cited [[The Beatles]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Beach Boys]] as influences.<ref name=":0"/> Sean Murphy of ''[[PopMatters]]'' wrote, "While rightly castigated for bringing inane lyrics to an almost holy level, listening to Yes is like listening to [[opera]]: the words are, or may as well be, in a different language.
