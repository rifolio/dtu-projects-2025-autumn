===1970s===

With the publicity generated from ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', Meat Loaf accepted an invitation by [[Motown]], in Detroit. In addition to appearing as "Mother" and "Ulysses S. Grant" at Detroit's Vest Pocket Theatre, he recorded  the vocals with fellow ''Hair'' performer [[Shaun Murphy (singer)|Shaun "Stoney" Murphy]] on an album of songs written and selected by the Motown production team. The album, titled ''[[Stoney & Meatloaf]]'' (with Meatloaf spelled as one word), was released in September 1971 and included the single "What You See Is What You Get"; it reached number 36 on the [[Best Selling Soul Singles]] chart and number 71 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Meat Loaf and Stoney toured with [[Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers]], opening for [[Richie Havens]], [[the Who]], [[the Stooges]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]]. Meat Loaf left Motown soon after the label replaced his and Stoney's vocals from the one song he liked, "Who Is the Leader of the People?" with new vocals by [[Edwin Starr]].<ref name=snapesobit/> He moved to [[Freeland, Michigan]], for a year and was the opening act at the [[Grande Ballroom]] 80 times.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.mlive.com/life/2022/01/meat-loaf-on-how-my-entire-career-started-in-michigan-legendary-singer-dead-at-74.html |title=Meat Loaf on how 'My entire career started in Michigan:' Legendary singer dead at 74 |first=Edward |last=Pevos |work=[[Booth Newspapers]] |date=January 21, 2022}}</ref>

In December 1972, Meat Loaf was in the original [[off-Broadway]] production of ''Rainbow'' at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] in New York.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/meat-loaf-dead |title=Meat Loaf 1947 – 2022 |first=Scott |last=Bernstein |work=[[JamBase]] |date=September 21, 2022 |archive-date=January 23, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220123224619/https://www.jambase.com/article/meat-loaf-dead |url-status=live}}</ref> After the tour, Meat Loaf rejoined the cast of ''Hair'', this time at a [[Broadway theater]]. After he hired an agent, he auditioned for the [[Public Theater]]'s production of ''[[More Than You Deserve]]''. During the audition, Meat Loaf met [[Jim Steinman]]. He sang a Stoney and Meat Loaf favorite of his, "(I'd Love to Be) As Heavy as Jesus", and subsequently got the part of Rabbit, a maniac that blows up his fellow soldiers so they can "go home." [[Ron Silver]] and [[Fred Gwynne]] were also in the show. In the summer between the show's workshop production (April 1973) and full production (November 1973 – January 1974), Meat Loaf appeared in a [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park]] production of ''[[As You Like It]]'' with [[Raul Julia]] and [[Mary Beth Hurt]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/bf9f8856-a142-7a91-e040-e00a18062ca3 |title=Meat Loaf and Raul Julia in the New York Shakespeare Festival stage production As You Like It |publisher=[[New York Public Library]] |archive-date=August 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808013742/https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/bf9f8856-a142-7a91-e040-e00a18062ca3 |url-status=live}}</ref>

About the same time, Meat Loaf and Steinman started work on ''[[Bat Out of Hell]]''. Meat Loaf convinced [[Epic Records]] to shoot music videos for four songs, "[[Bat Out of Hell (song)|Bat Out of Hell]]", "[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]", "[[You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth]]", and "[[Two Out of Three Ain't Bad]]" and convinced [[Lou Adler]], the producer of ''Rocky Horror'', to run the "Paradise" video as a trailer to the movie. During his recording of the soundtrack for ''Rocky Horror'', Meat Loaf recorded two more songs: "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]" (a [[Ben E. King]] cover), and "Clap Your Hands." They remained unreleased for a decade, until 1984, when they appeared as B-sides to the "[[Nowhere Fast (Fire Inc. song)|Nowhere Fast]]" single.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-best-covers-of-ben-e-kings-stand-by-me-172351/meat-loaf-158383/ |title=20 Best Covers of Ben E.

In 1976, Meat Loaf recorded lead vocals for [[Ted Nugent]]'s album ''[[Free-for-All (Ted Nugent album)|Free-for-All]]'' when regular Nugent lead vocalist [[Derek St. Holmes]] temporarily quit the band. Meat Loaf sang lead on five of the album's nine tracks.

''Bat Out of Hell'' has sold an estimated 43 million copies globally, including 15&nbsp;million in the United States, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.

===1980s===
In 1979, Steinman started to work on ''[[Bad for Good]]'', the intended follow-up to 1977's ''Bat Out of Hell''. During that time, a combination of touring, drugs and exhaustion had caused Meat Loaf to lose his voice. Without a singer, and pressured by the record company, Steinman decided that he should sing on ''Bad for Good'' himself. While Steinman worked on Bad for Good, Meat Loaf played the role of Travis Redfish in the movie ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'' until his singing voice returned.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Giles |first=Jeff |date=June 14, 2013 |title=40 Years Ago: Meat Loaf Leads an All-Star Cast in 'Roadie' |work=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/meat-loaf-roadie/}}</ref> Steinman then wrote a new album for Meat Loaf, ''[[Dead Ringer (album)|Dead Ringer]]'', which was released in September 1981.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/meat-loaf-dead-ringer/ |title=When Meat Loaf Finally Released a Follow-Up to 'Bat Out of Hell' |work=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |first=Jeff |last=Giles |date=September 4, 2016}}</ref> Steinman had written five new songs which, in addition to the track "More Than You Deserve" (sung by Meat Loaf in the stage musical of the same name) and a reworked monolog, formed the album ''Dead Ringer'', which was produced by Meat Loaf and [[Stephan Galfas]], with backing tracks produced by [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Jimmy Iovine]], and Steinman. In 1976, Meat Loaf appeared on the track "Keeper Keep Us", from the [[Intergalactic Touring Band]]'s self-titled album, produced by Galfas. The song "[[Dead Ringer for Love]]" was the pinnacle of the album, and launched Meat Loaf to even greater success. While it failed to chart in the US, it reached No. 5 in the United Kingdom and stayed in the UK Singles Chart for 19 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/dead%20ringer%20for%20love/ |title=Dead Ringer For Love |work=[[Officialcharts.com]]}}</ref> [[Cher]] provided the lead female vocals in the song.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.insider.com/meat-loaf-cher-pays-tribute-singer-death-aged-74-2022-1 |title=Cher, who sang a hit duet with Meat Loaf, pays tribute to 'amazing' singer after his death aged 74 |first=Sinéad |last=Baker |work=[[Insider.com]] |date=January 21, 2022}}</ref>

I was sitting with [[Jon Bon Jovi]] at one of those awards things, and I say, 'Oh, man, I love [[k.d. lang]]. I'd really like to meet her.'
