Following several lineup changes, Panic! at the Disco operated as the solo project of frontman Urie from 2015 until its discontinuation in 2023.

The band recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, they recorded and released their debut studio album, ''[[A Fever You Can't Sweat Out]]'' (2005). Popularized by the second single, "[[I Write Sins Not Tragedies]]", the album was certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] in the US. In 2006, Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by [[Jon Walker]]. The band's second album, ''[[Pretty. Odd.]]'' (2008), was preceded by the single "[[Nine in the Afternoon]]". The album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. Ross and Walker subsequently formed a new band, [[the Young Veins]], leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.

Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, "[[New Perspective (song)|New Perspective]]", for the film ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' (2009), and recruited bassist [[Dallon Weekes]] and guitarist [[Ian Crawford (musician)|Ian Crawford]] as touring musicians for live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010. The band's third studio album, ''[[Vices & Virtues]]'' (2011), was recorded solely by Urie and Smith in 2010, produced by [[John Feldmann]] and [[Butch Walker]]. Crawford departed once the tour cycle for ''Vices & Virtues'' ended in 2012. As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!]]'', in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health- and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. The duo recruited guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich as touring musicians for live performances.

In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with them since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring musician once again, resulting in Panic! becoming Urie's solo project. In January 2016, Panic! at the Disco released their fifth studio album, ''[[Death of a Bachelor]]''. In December 2017, Weekes officially announced his departure from the band, with [[Nicole Row]] replacing him in the touring lineup. In June 2018, Panic! at the Disco released their sixth studio album, ''[[Pray for the Wicked]]'', featuring their highest charting single "[[High Hopes (Panic! at the Disco song)|High Hopes]]". Panic! at the Disco's seventh studio album, ''[[Viva Las Vengeance]]'', was released on August 19, 2022. Following the conclusion of the [[Viva Las Vengeance Tour]] in March 2023, Urie disbanded Panic! at the Disco.

Ross and Urie sent a demo to [[Fall Out Boy]] bassist [[Pete Wentz]] via a [[LiveJournal]] account.<ref name="cred" /> Wentz, who was in Los Angeles at the time with the rest of Fall Out Boy working on the band's major-label debut, ''[[From Under the Cork Tree]]'', drove to Las Vegas to meet with the young, unsigned band.<ref name="cred">{{cite web|first=James|last=Montgomery|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1522957/panic-at-disco-fight-cred.jhtml|title=Panic!

Meanwhile, Wentz began to hype the band wherever possible: from wearing "Pete! at the Disco" T-shirts onstage to mentioning the group in interviews. Wentz gave a quick shout-out to the band during a press junket on the day before the [[2005 MTV Video Music Awards]]: "I've got a couple of bands coming out soon on Decaydance, one being this band called Panic! at the Disco," Wentz said.

[[File:PanicAtTheDisco.jpg|thumb|left|In 2006, the band headlined their first tour and achieved platinum status on their debut album.]]
The band relocated to College Park, Maryland, to record its debut album from June to September 2005.<ref name="vegasreviewjournal"/> Although they only had shells of songs when they arrived, the rest of the album shaped up fast through the marathon session.<ref name="vegasreviewjournal"/> "We didn't have a day off in the five-and-a-half weeks we were there, 12 or 14 hours a day," Ross said in a 2005 interview.<ref name="vegasreviewjournal"/> "We were making things up in our heads that weren't there, and on top of the stress of trying to finish the record, we were living in a one-bedroom apartment with four people on bunk beds," recalled Ross. "Everyone got on everybody's nerves. Someone would write a new part for a song and someone else would say they didn't like it just because you ate their cereal that morning."<ref name="heraldsun">{{cite web|first=Cathy|last=McCabe|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/time-to-hit-panic-button/story-e6frf9hf-1111112310242|title=Time to hit panic button|work=[[Herald Sun]]|date=October 5, 2006|access-date=June 2, 2022|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121230213759/http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/time-to-hit-panic-button/story-e6frf9hf-1111112310242|archive-date=December 30, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On May 17, 2006, Panic! at the Disco announced that original bassist Brent Wilson had left the band, "posting a statement that was both diplomatic and entirely inscrutable […] yet [failing] to mention any reason why Wilson is leaving Panic," according to [[MTV News]].<ref name="wilson">{{cite web|first=James|last=Montgomery|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1532098/panic-at-disco-claim-split-with-bassist-was-amicable.jhtml|title=Panic!

Smith wrote a lengthy e-mail back to James Montgomery of MTV News, stating, in part, "We made the decision based on Brent's lack of responsibility and the fact that he wasn't progressing musically with the band," and revealed that Wilson did not write nor play any bass present on ''Fever.''

[…] We've written a bunch of songs since we've been home [Las Vegas]. I think it's the most fun and the happiest we've been since we started."
