==Career==
===1980s–2000===
Satriani started playing in a San Francisco-based band called Squares, which he formed with his brother-in-law Neil Sheehan in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Satriani Revisits His Band Squares, Shares Unhinged 'I Love How You Love Me' Cover: Premiere |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/joe-satriani-squares-interview-8498853/ |website=billboard.com |date=February 19, 2019 |access-date=May 8, 2021}}</ref> He was later invited to join [[the Greg Kihn Band]], who were on the downside of their career, but whose generosity helped Satriani pay off the overwhelming credit card debt from recording his first album, ''[[Not of This Earth (Joe Satriani album)|Not of This Earth]]'', released in 1986.<ref name="vault">{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Mike|title=Interview with Joe Satriani|publisher=BWBK|url=http://www.satriani.com/vault/1998-iview-blackburn.shtml|date=March 25, 1998|access-date=August 10, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717185746/http://www.satriani.com/vault/1998-iview-blackburn.shtml|archive-date = July 17, 2011}}</ref> The same year, he also sang backing vocals on the self-titled [[Crowded House (album)|Crowded House]] album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Finn: A Quick Fire Interview |url=https://www.davidcleland.com/a-quick-fire-interview-with-neil-finn/ |website=davidcleland.com |date=December 23, 2024 |access-date=May 4, 2025}}</ref>

In 1987, Satriani's second album, ''[[Surfing with the Alien]]'', produced radio hits and was the first all-instrumental release to chart so highly in many years. The track "Crushing Day" was featured on the soundtrack of a low-budget film titled ''[[It Takes Two (1988 film)|It Takes Two]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095384/|publisher=IMDb.com|title=It Takes Two (1988)|date=July 13, 1988|access-date=November 4, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211090917/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095384/|archive-date=December 11, 2015}}</ref> In 1988, Satriani helped produce the EP ''[[The Eyes of Horror]]'' for the [[death metal]] band [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]]. That same year, he also released an EP titled ''Dreaming #11'', which featured the song "The Crush of Love". In 1989, Satriani released the album ''[[Flying in a Blue Dream]]''. It was said to be inspired by the death of his father, who died in 1989 during the recording of the album. "One Big Rush" featured on the soundtrack to the [[Cameron Crowe]] movie ''[[Say Anything...]]''. "The Forgotten Part II" was featured on a [[Molson Brewery|Molson Dry]] commercial in Canada in 1993. "Can't Slow Down" featured in a car chase sequence in the [[Don Johnson]]-starring show ''[[Nash Bridges]]''.

In 1992, Satriani released ''[[The Extremist]]'', his most commercially successful album to date. The album was certified Gold in the United States and peaked at number 22 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-extremist-mw0000084603/awards|title=The Extremist - Joe Satriani - Awards|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|access-date=November 19, 2021}}</ref> Radio stations across the US picked up "Summer Song", which got a major boost when [[Sony]] used it in a major commercial campaign for their [[Discman]] portable CD players. "Cryin'", "[[Friends (Joe Satriani song)|Friends]]", and the title track were regional hits on radio. In late 1993, Satriani joined [[Deep Purple]] as a temporary replacement for departed guitarist [[Ritchie Blackmore]] during the band's Japanese tour. The concerts were a success, and Satriani was asked to join the band permanently, but he declined, having just signed a multi-album solo deal with Sony, and [[Steve Morse]] took the guitarist slot in Deep Purple.<ref name="Purple">{{cite web |url=http://www.deep-purple.net/tree/mk6.htm |title=Deep Purple Mark 6 History |publisher=Deep-purple.net |access-date=April 23, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419214848/http://www.deep-purple.net/tree/mk6.htm |archive-date=April 19, 2014 }}</ref>

In 1996, Satriani founded [[G3 (tour)|G3]], a concert tour intended to include a rotating trio of guitarists. The original lineup featured Satriani, Steve Vai, and [[Eric Johnson (guitarist, born 1954)|Eric Johnson]].

Other guitarists who have performed in G3 include [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[John Petrucci]], [[Kenny Wayne Shepherd]], [[Robert Fripp]], [[Andy Timmons]], [[Ulrich Roth|Uli Jon Roth]], [[Michael Schenker]], [[Adrian Legg]], [[Paul Gilbert]], [[Steve Morse]], and [[Steve Lukather]]. In 1998, Satriani recorded and released ''[[Crystal Planet]]'', followed by ''[[Engines of Creation (album)|Engines of Creation]]'', one of his more experimental works featuring the [[electronica]] genre. Two shows at the [[Fillmore West]] in San Francisco were recorded in December 2000 and released as ''[[Live in San Francisco (Joe Satriani album)|Live in San Francisco]]'', a two-disc live album and DVD.

==Equipment==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2022}}

Satriani endorses [[Ibanez]]'s [[Ibanez JS Series|JS Series]] guitars and the [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] JVM410HJS amplifier. Both lines were designed specifically for him as signature products. The Ibanez JS1 (the original JS model) was based on, and replaced, the Ibanez 540 Radius model that Satriani first endorsed. Many of his guitars are made by the company, including the JS1000 and JS1200. These guitars typically feature the [[DiMarzio]] PAF Pro (which he used up until 1993 in both the neck and bridge positions), the [[DiMarzio]] Fred (which he used in the bridge position from 1993 to 2005), and the Mo' Joe and the Paf Joe (which he has used in the bridge and neck positions from 2005 to the present). He has more recently{{when|date=May 2024}} introduced the Satch Track single-coil pickup that he used in his humbucker/single coil-equipped signature Ibanez guitars. He has since replaced the Satch Track with the Sustainiac.

The JS line of guitars is Satriani's signature line, with the JS1000, JS1200, JS2400, JSBDG, and JS20th using Ibanez's original Edge double-locking tremolo bridge. The JS100 and JS120s both use Ibanez's Edge 3 tremolo bridge. The JS1600 is a fixed-bridge guitar with no tremolo system. The guitar he was most associated with during the 1990s was a chrome-finished guitar nicknamed "Chrome Boy". This instrument can be seen on the ''[[Live in San Francisco (Joe Satriani album)|Live in San Francisco]]'' DVD. However, the guitar used for most of the concert was in fact a lookalike nicknamed "Pearly", which featured [[Seymour Duncan]] Pearly Gates pickups.

Satriani uses a number of other JS models, such as the JS double neck model, JS700 (primary axe on his self-titled CD, seen on the 1995 ''Joe Satriani'' tour, which features a fixed bridge, [[P-90]] pickups, and a matching mahogany body and neck), JS6/JS6000 (natural body), JS1 (the original JS model), JS2000 (fixed-bridge model), a variety of JS100s, JS1000s and JS1200s with custom paint work, and a large number of prototype JSs. All double-locking bridges have been the original Edge tremolo, not the newer models, which point to a more custom guitar than the off-the-shelf models. Satriani played a red 7-string JS model, seen in the ''G3 Live in Tokyo'' DVD from 2005. He also has a prototype 24-fret version of the JS, now called the JS–2400, which he has used with Chickenfoot. He has also used other prototypes featuring a Sustainiac or a JS model with three single coil-sized humbucker pickups.

Satriani has used a wide variety of [[guitar amps]], with Marshalls being his main amplifier (notably the limited-edition blue-colored 6100 LM model) up until 2001, and his Peavey signature series amps, the Peavey JSX, up until his time with Chickenfoot.

[[File:JS Guitars 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Guitars used by Satriani during the 2013 ''[[Unstoppable Momentum]]'' tour]]

The JSX began life as a prototype Peavey XXX and developed into the Joe Satriani signature Peavey model. However, Satriani still used distortion pedals with the clean channel rather than the built-in overdrive channels. He has used other amplifiers over the years in the studio, such as the Peavey 5150 (used to record the song "[[Crystal Planet]]"), Cornford, and the [[Mesa/Boogie]] Mark IIC+ (used to record the song "[[Flying in a Blue Dream]]"), among others. He later switched to the Marshall JVM series, having used a modified JVM 410H in his ''Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards'' tour in 2010 and with Chickenfoot in 2010 and 2011.

These modified JVM Marshall amps were prototypes for a signature amp that Marshall scheduled for release in 2011. They replaced the [[reverb]] with [[noise gate]]s that eliminate lag when switching channels. The clean channel was replaced by the clean channel of a 6100 LM model, which Satriani likes as an option to use [[distortion pedal]]s with. The orange overdrive channel and the modern red overdrive channel have been better matched with each other as Satriani claims to prefer the organic overdrive of the JVM over pedals. The red overdrive channel was modified for a beefy rock rather than a [[nu metal]] sound. The effect loop has been simplified to be serial only.

Satriani has used many amps in the studio when recording, including the Peavey Classic. He used Marshall heads and cabinets, including live, prior to his Peavey endorsement.

==Musical themes==
Satriani's work frequently makes references to various [[science fiction]] stories and ideas. "[[Surfing with the Alien (instrumental)|Surfing with the Alien]]", "Back to [[Shalla-Bal]]", and "The Power Cosmic 2000" refer to the comic book character [[Silver Surfer]], while "Ice 9" refers to the secret government ice weapon in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Cat's Cradle]]''. "Borg Sex" is a reference to ''[[Star Trek]]'', which features a [[cybernetic]] race known as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]]. His albums and songs often have otherworldly titles, such as ''[[Not of This Earth (Joe Satriani album)|Not of this Earth]]'', ''[[Crystal Planet]]'', ''[[Is There Love in Space?]]'', and ''[[Engines of Creation (Joe Satriani album)|Engines of Creation]]''.

On the album ''[[Super Colossal]]'', the song titled "Crowd Chant" was originally called "Party on the Enterprise". It would have featured [[sampling (music)|sampled]] sounds from the ''[[Starship Enterprise]]'' from ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. But as Satriani explained in a [[podcast]], legal issues regarding the samples could not be resolved, and he was unable to get permission to use them.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Joe Satriani |date=2006 |url=http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/13_crowd_chant_podcast.mp3 |title=Crowd Chant |type=Podcast |publisher=Sony Music |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061034/http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/13_crowd_chant_podcast.mp3 |archive-date=December 19, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He then removed the sounds from the song and called it "Crowd Chant". Its ending theme was inspired by composer [[Gabriel Fauré]]'s "[[Pavane (Fauré)|Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musoscribe.com/features/joe_satriani.shtml |title=Features and Interviews > Guitarist Joe Satriani |date=February 7, 2008 |publisher=Musoscribe.com |access-date=April 23, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113649/http://www.musoscribe.com/features/joe_satriani.shtml |archive-date=December 24, 2013 }}</ref> The song is used as goal celebration music for a number of [[National Hockey League]] and [[Major League Soccer]] teams, including the [[Minnesota Wild]] (NHL), [[New York Islanders]] (NHL), and [[New England Revolution]] (MLS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesotawild.com |title=Minnesota Wild Home |publisher=Minnesotawild.com |access-date=August 2, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030926210041/http://www.minnesotawild.com/ |archive-date=September 26, 2003 }}</ref> The song is also used in the [[2K Sports]] hockey video game ''NHL 2k10''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2ksports.com/beats/games/nhl2k10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119095513/http://2ksports.com/beats/games/nhl2k10 |archive-date=November 19, 2012 |title=2K Sports – 2K Beats : NHL 2K10 |access-date=April 23, 2014}}</ref>

"Redshift Riders", another song from ''[[Super Colossal]]'', is "...based on the idea that in the future, when people can travel throughout space, they will theoretically take advantage of the cosmological [[redshift]] effect so they can be swung around large planetary objects and get across [the] universe a lot faster than normal", according to Satriani.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Joe Satriani |date=2006 |url=http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/04_redshift_riders_podcast.mp3 |title=Redshift Riders |type=Podcast |publisher=Sony Music |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061047/http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/04_redshift_riders_podcast.mp3 |archive-date=December 19, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> On the album ''[[Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock]]'', the song "I Just Wanna Rock" is about a giant robot on the run who happens to stumble upon a rock concert.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myplay.com/artists/joe-satriani/bio#review-form |title=Joe Satriani – Artist Bio &#124; Myplay: Powered by Sony Music |publisher=Myplay |access-date=August 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301120932/http://myplay.com/artists/joe-satriani/bio#review-form |archive-date=March 1, 2010 }}</ref>
