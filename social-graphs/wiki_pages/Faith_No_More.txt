==History==
[[File:Faith no more logo.png|thumb|The band's classic logo, used on the 1985 debut ''We Care a Lot''. It was originally designed by bassist [[Billy Gould]] as an homage to the [[Symbol of Chaos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faithnoman.com/faith-no-more-logo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824005523/http://faithnoman.com/faith-no-more-logo|url-status=usurped|archive-date=August 24, 2013|title=The Faith No More logo|work=faithnoman.com|access-date=April 18, 2017}}</ref>]]

===Early days (1979–1984)===
The genesis of Faith No More was the group Sharp Young Men, formed in 1979,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Faith No More – The Vogue |url=https://thevogue.com/artists/faith-no-more/ |access-date=2024-01-31 |language=en}}</ref> by vocalist Mike Morris and keyboardist Wade Worthington. Drummer [[Mike Bordin]] and bassist [[Billy Gould]] joined afterwards. Morris called the name "a piss-take on all the 'elegant' groups at the time."<ref name=mike-morris>{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Mike|title=Faith No Man bio by Mike Morris|url=http://faithnoman.com/bio|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824005518/http://faithnoman.com/bio|url-status=usurped|archive-date=August 24, 2013|access-date=October 1, 2014}}</ref> Later, he proposed the name Faith In No Man, but eventually the band settled on Bordin's suggestion, Faith No Man (stylized as Faith. No Man).<ref name="mike-morris"/> The band recorded "[[Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty]]", released in 1983. The songs were recorded in [[Matt Wallace (record producer)|Matt Wallace]]'s parents' garage, where Wallace had set up and been running a recording studio while the band was still recording under the name Sharp Young Men,<ref name=chriazi22>{{harvnb|Chirazi|1994|p=22}}</ref> with Morris, Gould, Bordin and Worthington. Worthington left shortly thereafter. The band's name was changed to Faith No Man for the release of the single, which featured two of the three songs recorded in Wallace's garage,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://old.fnm.com/faq/#4| title=Faith No More Frequently Answered Questions|website=Fnm.com| author=Agatha Samborska| access-date=November 5, 2011}}</ref> and Roddy Bottum replaced Worthington. Bottum, Gould and Bordin quit the band shortly after and formed Faith No More. They chose the name in September 1983 to accentuate the fact that "The Man" (Morris) was "No More". The band played with several vocalists and guitarists, including a brief stint with [[Courtney Love]], until it settled on vocalist [[Chuck Mosley]] in 1983<ref name="chuckdead"/> and, later, guitarist [[Jim Martin (musician)|Jim Martin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chirazi|1994|pp=21–23}}</ref> Their first release under the Faith No More name was a self-titled cassette in 1983, which featured a live performance from that year on Side A, and a 20-minute instrumental track on Side B.

=== ''We Care a Lot'' and ''Introduce Yourself'' (1985–1988) ===
[[File:Chuck Mosley.jpg|thumb|Faith No More's singer from 1984 to 1988, [[Chuck Mosley]] (photo from 2016)]]
After the name change, the band initially started recording ''We Care a Lot'' without backing from a record label and, after pooling their money, recorded five songs. This gained the attention of Ruth Schwartz, who was then forming the independent label [[Mordam Records]], under which the band, after getting the necessary financial support, finished and released the album. It was the first official release for both the band and the label.<ref name=reflex25>{{cite web|url=http://negele.org/db/index.php3?band=2&year=1992&month=6&id=980 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710145546/http://negele.org/db/index.php3?band=2&year=1992&month=6&id=980 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=Faith No More: Angel Dust in the wind |access-date=June 15, 2008 |first=Jem |last=Aswad |date=June 1992 |work=Issue 25 |publisher=Reflex Magazine }}</ref>

In late 1986, Faith No More was signed to [[Los Angeles]] label [[Slash Records]] by Anna Statman.<ref name="iyfollowers">{{cite web|url=http://www.faithnomorefollowers.com/2015/03/how-about-another-great-article-from.html|title=FAITH NO MORE BAND OF THE YEAR 1990|website=Faithnomorefollowers.com|date=March 7, 2015 |access-date=January 21, 2017}}</ref> The label had recently been sold to the [[Warner Music Group]] subsidiary [[London Records]], ensuring a widespread release for the band's following albums. ''[[Introduce Yourself]]'' was released in April 1987, and a revamped version of their debut album's title track "[[We Care a Lot (song)|We Care a Lot]]" saw minor success on MTV. Mosley's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic, particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him allegedly punching [[Billy Gould]] on stage,<ref name="tr"/> the release party for the album ''Introduce Yourself''—during which he fell asleep on stage—and one of Mosley's roadies getting into a fistfight with Martin during the European tour.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fnm.com/bio.shtml| title=Faith No More BIOGRAPHY| access-date=November 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name="tr">{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-04-22/faith-no-more-the-real-story|title=Faith No More: The Real Story|date=April 22, 2014|work=teamrock.com|access-date=April 18, 2017}}</ref> Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Gould reflected, "There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so far off the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band. I just said: 'I'm done—I can't take this any longer. It's just so ridiculous'. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: 'Well, I still want to play with you'. Bottum did the same thing. It was another one of these 'firing somebody without firing them' scenarios."<ref name="tr"/>

===Mike Patton joins and ''The Real Thing'' (1989–1991)===
[[File:FNM PP TRT.jpg|thumb|Faith No More in a promotional photo for ''[[The Real Thing (Faith No More album)|The Real Thing]]'', c. 1989–1990]]
Mosley was replaced with singer [[Mike Patton]] in 1988. Patton, who was singing with his high school band, [[Mr. Bungle]], was recruited at Martin's suggestion after he heard Mr. Bungle's first demo tape, ''The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cee |first=Gary |date=November 30, 1990 |title=Faith No More: Inside the insatiable Mike Patton |journal=Circus Magazine |issue=#369 |pages=62–64 |url=http://negele.org/db/index.php3?band=2&year=1990&month=11&day=30&id=1531 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712084106/http://negele.org/db/index.php3?band=2&year=1990&month=11&day=30&id=1531 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |access-date=September 26, 2008 }}</ref> According to Patton, he first met the band during a 1986 gig at "a pizza parlor" in his hometown of [[Eureka, California]].<ref name="followerstape">{{cite web|url=http://www.faithnomorefollowers.com/2015/10/mike-patton-and-mr-bungle-tape.html|title=Mike Patton And The Mr Bungle Tape|date=October 4, 2015|website=Faithnomorefollowers.com|access-date=January 22, 2017}}</ref> Two weeks after joining Faith No More, he had written the lyrics to the songs that made up the Grammy award-nominated ''[[The Real Thing (Faith No More album)|The Real Thing]]'', which was released in June 1989.<ref name="fnm.com"/>

"[[Epic (Faith No More song)|Epic]]" was released in January 1990 and was a top 10 hit. The music video received extensive airplay on MTV in 1990, and angered [[animal rights]] activists for a slow-motion shot of a fish flopping out of water at the end of the video.<ref>{{cite news |title=Inventory: 9 Music Videos Featuring Animals In Prominent Roles |newspaper=The A.V.

In 1990, the band went on an extensive U.S. tour, sending ''The Real Thing'' to Platinum status in Canada, the U.S., and South America. The album also had big sales numbers in Australia, U.K., and the rest of Europe, pushing the total sales well above 4 million worldwide.

In February 1991, Faith No More released its only official live album, ''[[You Fat Bastards: Live at the Brixton Academy|Live at the Brixton Academy]]''. The album includes two previously unreleased studio tracks, "The Grade" and "The Cowboy Song". The same year, the band contributed the song "The Perfect Crime" to the soundtrack to ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''. Martin also made a brief cameo in the film as "Sir James Martin" as the head of the "Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center". Patton's original band [[Mr. Bungle]] went on to sign with Slash and [[Reprise Records]]'s parent label [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1991, after the worldwide success of ''The Real Thing''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-02-03-ca-616-story.html|title=Warner Records Stays Faithful to Mike Patton's Bungle|first=PATRICK|last=GOLDSTEIN|date=February 3, 1991|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=January 21, 2017}}</ref>

Aside from "[[A Small Victory (song)|A Small Victory]]" (which received a nomination for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]] at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]]), the tracks "[[Midlife Crisis]]" and "[[Everything's Ruined]]" were also released as singles. The album included a re-recording of the theme to the film ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', and later pressings included a cover of [[The Commodores]]' "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]", which in some parts of the world became the band's biggest hit. ''Angel Dust'' charted one spot higher on the [[Billboard 200]] than ''The Real Thing'', but was not as commercially successful in the U.S., selling 665,000 copies there. It outsold ''The Real Thing'' in many other countries. In Germany, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 250,000 copies. The album also matched the sales of ''The Real Thing'' in Canada (Platinum) and Australia (Gold), and surpassed it in the Netherlands, France, Russia, and the U.K. Worldwide sales are around 3.1 million copies.

After touring to support ''Angel Dust'' in the summer of 1993, longtime guitarist Martin left the band due to internal conflicts. He was reportedly unhappy with the band's change in musical direction on ''Angel Dust'', calling it "gay disco".<ref name="the real story 2014">{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-04-22/faith-no-more-the-real-story|title=Faith No More: The Real Story|date=April 22, 2014|website=Teamrock.com|access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref> According to Bottum, Martin was fired via fax.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/story-behind-the-album-faith-no-more/ |title=Story Behind The Album: Faith No More |website=Metalhammer.co.uk |date=March 13, 2009 |access-date=November 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210220222/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/story-behind-the-album-faith-no-more/ |archive-date=December 10, 2010 }}</ref> Martin himself states it was his decision to leave.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite book | title=Metal: The Definitive Guide | year=2007 | author=Garry Sharpe-Young | page=483 | isbn=978-1-906002-01-5 | publisher=Jawbone Press | location=London, England}}</ref> Both [[Godflesh]] guitarist [[Justin Broadrick]] and [[Killing Joke]] guitarist [[Geordie Walker]] were reportedly invited to join Faith No More after Martin's departure, but declined.<ref>[http://www.anirrationaldomain.net/articles/current/kerrang120403.html Archived copy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110234713/http://www.anirrationaldomain.net/articles/current/kerrang120403.html|date=January 10, 2016}}</ref> The position was filled by Mike Patton's Mr. Bungle bandmate [[Trey Spruance]], who left after recording 1995's ''[[King for a Day...

===''King for a Day...'', ''Album of the Year'' and break-up (1995–1998)===
[[File:Faith No More logo.png|thumb|The alternate "barking dog logo", based on the artwork for Faith No More's 1995 album ''King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime'']]
Faith No More's fifth studio album, ''[[King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime]],'' was released in March 1995,<ref name="fnm.com"/> and varies greatly from song to song in style; [[punk rock|punk]], [[country music|country]], [[jazz]], [[bossa nova]], [[thrash metal]], [[gospel music]], along with other signature FNM elements, are woven together throughout the album. Singles included "[[Digging the Grave]]", "[[Evidence (Faith No More song)|Evidence]]", and "[[Ricochet (Faith No More song)|Ricochet]]". The album featured Mr. Bungle's [[Trey Spruance]] on guitar. The record went Gold in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands and Germany, which gave the album a respectable sales figure of around 1.5 million copies; this was significantly lower than the sales of their previous albums. A 7&nbsp;x&nbsp;7-inch box set of singles was released, which included the B-sides and some interviews between the songs.

''[[Album of the Year (Faith No More album)|Album of the Year]]'' was released in June 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries (for example, in Germany, the album debuted at No.&nbsp;2 and stayed in the chart for 5 months). In Australia, ''Album of the Year'' went to No.&nbsp;1 and was certified Platinum. The album charted in many countries in Europe. To date,{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=As of when? The phrase "to date" is totally meaningless on a site that changes over time!}} ''Album of the Year'' has sold around 2 million copies worldwide. The singles "[[Ashes to Ashes (Faith No More song)|Ashes to Ashes]]" and "[[Last Cup of Sorrow]]" had minimal success (notably, the music video for "Last Cup of Sorrow", which featured actress [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], was inspired by the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'').
