'''Anthrax''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band from New York City, formed in 1981 by rhythm guitarist [[Scott Ian]] and bassist [[Dan Lilker]]. The group is considered one of the leaders of the thrash metal scene from the 1980s and is part of the "Big Four" of the genre, along with [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Slayer]]. They were also one of the first thrash metal bands (along with [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] and [[Nuclear Assault]]) to emerge from the East Coast.<ref name="loudersound">{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-a-z-of-anthrax|title=The A-Z of Anthrax|publisher=loudersound.com|date=October 28, 2016|access-date=August 18, 2018}}</ref> The band's current lineup consists of Scott Ian, drummer [[Charlie Benante]], bassist [[Frank Bello]], vocalist [[Joey Belladonna]] and lead guitarist [[Jonathan Donais]]. Anthrax's lineup has changed numerous times over their career, leaving Ian as the only constant member of the band. Ian and Benante (who replaced one-time drummer [[Greg D'Angelo]] in 1983) are the only two members to appear on all of Anthrax's albums, while Bello has been a member of Anthrax since 1984, replacing Lilker.

After cycling through a number of members, Anthrax released their debut album, ''[[Fistful of Metal]]'' (1984), with singer [[Neil Turbin]]. Turbin was replaced by [[Joey Belladonna]] later that year, stabilizing the band's lineup. Anthrax's third album ''[[Among the Living]]'' (1987), which brought the band mainstream success for the first time, is recognized as one of the greatest thrash metal albums.<ref>{{cite web |last=Considine |first=J.

Bush's first album with Anthrax, ''[[Sound of White Noise]]'' (1993), reached number seven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart (their greatest chart success) and spawned the radio hit "[[Only (Anthrax song)|Only]]". Anthrax's subsequent albums with Bush would experience less critical and commercial success; the band would part ways with Elektra following the release of ''[[Stomp 442]]'' (1995) due to a lack of promotional support, and ''[[Volume 8: The Threat Is Real|Volume 8: The Threat is Real]]'' (1998) suffered from the bankruptcy of their record label.

Bush left Anthrax in 2005, after which the band reunited with Belladonna and lead guitarist [[Dan Spitz]]. After Belladonna and Spitz's departure in 2007, Anthrax recruited singer [[Dan Nelson]] and commenced work on a new album, although Nelson would part ways with the band in 2009. Following a short-lived reunion with Bush, Belladonna rejoined the band for a third time in 2010. Anthrax's first studio album in eight years, and first with Belladonna in 21 years, ''[[Worship Music (album)|Worship Music]]'' (2011) was released to critical and commercial success, reaching number twelve on the ''Billboard'' 200. Their most recent album to date, ''[[For All Kings]]'', was released in 2016. The band is expected to release their twelfth studio album in 2026.<ref name="newalbum 2026">{{cite web|url=https://www.1057thepoint.com/music-news/anthrax-readies-first-new-album-in-10-years-so-riff-centric-and-brutal/|title=Anthrax readies first new album in 10 years: 'So riff-centric and brutal'|website=[[KPNT|105.7 The Point]]|access-date=June 23, 2025|date=April 30, 2025}}</ref>

Anthrax has released 11 studio albums, several other albums, and 26 singles, including collaborating on [[Bring the Noise#Anthrax version|a single]] with American [[hip hop]] group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. Four of the band's studio albums (''Among the Living'', ''State of Euphoria'', ''Persistence of Time'' and ''Sound of White Noise'') have also achieved gold certifications by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=ANTHRAX&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section |access-date=September 1, 2020 |publisher=riaa.com}}</ref> According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], Anthrax sold 2.5&nbsp;million records in the United States from 1991 to 2004, with total worldwide sales of ten million.

==History==
===Formation (1981–1982)===
Anthrax was formed in [[Queens]], New York City, on July 18, 1981,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maron|first1=Marc|title=Episode 685 -Scott Ian|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_685_-_scott_ian|website=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast|date=February 29, 2016 |access-date=February 29, 2016}}</ref> by guitarists [[Scott Ian]] and [[Dan Lilker]], with Ian's friend Dave Weiss on drums. The band was named after the disease [[anthrax|of the same name]] which Ian saw in a biology textbook, chosen because it sounded "sufficiently evil".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|title=Anthrax's Scott Ian Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?'|url=http://loudwire.com/anthrax-scott-ian-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/|work=[[Loudwire]]|date=April 16, 2014|access-date=May 22, 2014}}</ref> Lilker originally intended for Scott Setari to play bass in the band, during their early phases as a cover band.<ref>{{Cite episode |title= NYHC Chronicles Live |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PFA9DYVJ34 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/9PFA9DYVJ34| archive-date=2021-12-11 |url-status=live|series= NYHC Chronicles |access-date= 14 May 2020 |date=13 May 2020 |number=17 |minutes=30}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Anthrax's initial lineup was completed by singer [[John Connelly (musician)|John Connelly]], and bassist Paul Kahn. Kahn was briefly replaced by bassist Kenny Kushner before Lilker took over on bass. Future [[Hittman (band)|Hittman]] singer Dirk Kennedy replaced Connelly for a few months and the band brought in lead guitarist Greg Walls. Weiss was then replaced early on by drummer [[Greg D'Angelo]], who was recommended to the band by Walls. Ian's younger brother Jason Rosenfeld had been a temporary vocalist until Ian's former schoolmate [[Neil Turbin]] joined the band in late August 1982. Turbin joined the band partly because of guitarist Walls, who Turbin later said was "the best guitarist Anthrax ever had".<ref name=Turbin2003>{{cite web |url=https://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/NeilTurbin-Dec2003.htm |title=Neil Turbin: Former Anthrax Vocalist Returns With New Album |date=December 2003 |first=Keith |last=McDonald |website=Metal-Rules.com Heart of Steel Interviews |access-date=March 28, 2021}}</ref> The band recorded its first demo tape during this time.

===Neil Turbin era and debut album (1982–1984)===
[[File:Anthrax1983.jpg|thumb|left|Anthrax in 1983. From left to right: [[Charlie Benante]], [[Dan Spitz]], [[Neil Turbin]], [[Scott Ian]] and [[Dan Lilker]]. This lineup recorded the band's first album ''[[Fistful of Metal]]''.]]

The band's first performance with Neil Turbin was at Great Gildersleeves, a New York club, in September 1982. This lineup played regularly in the New York–New Jersey area over the next several months. Anthrax was also on the same bill as then-up-and-coming [[Metallica]] for several shows in the spring of 1983. Guitarist Walls left Anthrax that summer because of friction with Ian, and drummer D'Angelo left a month later. Turbin said he was seriously considering leaving because of the loss of Walls and D'Angelo, but he stuck it out for another year.<ref name=Turbin2003/> Walls was replaced by Bob Berry, who was recommended to Turbin by [[Rhett Forrester]] of [[Riot (band)|Riot]]. Berry was in turn soon replaced by [[Dan Spitz]], who was previously a member of the New Jersey thrash band [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]].

Drummer [[Charlie Benante]] replaced D'Angelo in September 1983 after a several-month courtship by Ian. By this time, Ian and Lilker had befriended New Jersey record store owner [[Jon Zazula]], to whom they had given their demo tapes to critique. Zazula's new record label [[Megaforce Records]] had recently released Metallica's debut album ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' to great success. In late 1983, Zazula agreed to sign Anthrax and the band recorded the "Soldiers of Metal" single, which was produced by [[Ross the Boss]] of [[Manowar]]. The B-side was the song "Howling Furies" which was taken from a previous demo with Greg D'Angelo on drums (his only Anthrax recording).

Anthrax released their debut album ''[[Fistful of Metal]]'' in January 1984. Former guitarist Walls said he was shocked that the album was released without giving credit to Walls as the primary songwriter on "Panic" and "Metal Thrashing Mad", as well as smaller songwriting contributions throughout the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://metalshockfinland.com/2016/10/25/the-metal-voice-interview-with-ex-anthrax-guitarist-greg-walls-talking-about-his-lost-opportunity-to-replace-dave-mustaine-in-metallica/ |title=The Metal Voice Interview With Ex-Anthrax Guitarist Greg Walls, Talking About His Lost Opportunity to Replace Dave Mustaine in Metallica |date=October 25, 2015 |last=Kay |first=Jimmy |website=Metal Shock Finland, The Metal Voice |access-date=March 28, 2021}}</ref> Tensions were building between Lilker and Turbin for various reasons, eventually leading to Turbin firing Lilker without informing the rest of the band.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/scott-ian-anthrax-hated-neil-turbin-s-guts | title=Scott Ian: Anthrax hated Neil Turbin's guts | date=October 9, 2014 }}</ref> He would soon form the band [[Nuclear Assault]] with former Anthrax roadie / vocalist John Connelly.<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Pasbani|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/oh/former-anthrax-vocalist-neil-turbin-claims-he-was-once-asked-to-be-the-frontman-of-metallica|title=Former Anthrax Vocalist Neil Turbin Claims He Was Once Asked to be the Frontman of Metallica|work=Metal Injection|date=August 29, 2014|access-date=August 30, 2014}}</ref> Lilker was replaced by Benante's nephew and roadie [[Frank Bello]]. The band then went on a successful US tour opening for [[Raven (British band)|Raven]] and others to support ''Fistful of Metal''.

In August 1984, Turbin and Anthrax went their separate ways after long-standing personal issues. In his book ''Eddie Trunk's Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal'', music journalist [[Eddie Trunk]] admits pressuring [[Jon Zazula]], Scott Ian and Anthrax into firing Turbin because of his personal taste in vocals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trunk|first=Eddie|author-link=Eddie Trunk|title=Eddie Trunk's Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal|chapter=Anthrax|page=240|publisher=[[Abrams Books]]|date=August 30, 2011|location=New York City}}</ref> Singer [[Matt Fallon]] was briefly hired in late 1984, but he and the band soon parted ways.  The remaining members decided to play live shows as a four-piece billed as "The Diseased" with Scott Ian on vocals, performing [[hardcore punk]] covers until a permanent singer could be found.

In 1984, [[Joey Belladonna]] was chosen as the new vocalist.<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|pages=29/30}}</ref> The ''[[Armed and Dangerous (EP)|Armed and Dangerous]]'' EP marked Belladonna's recording debut with Anthrax.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The 1992 reissue of the EP included the two songs from the "Soldiers of Metal" single that had Neil Turbin performing on them.

Anthrax's second album ''[[Spreading the Disease]]'' was released in October 1985.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> It was well-received as both a technical leap forward from ''Fistful of Metal'' and as a more original effort, and remains one of the band's most highly regarded albums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/spreading-the-disease-mw0000651094|title=Spreading the Disease - Anthrax &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 14, 2021}}</ref> With leftover studio time from these sessions, Ian, Benante and former bandmate Dan Lilker collaborated with vocalist [[Billy Milano]] to form the side project [[Stormtroopers of Death]],<ref name="LarkinHR"/> and recorded the album ''[[Speak English or Die]]'' in three days. It was released in August 1985 and is now considered a pioneering [[crossover thrash]] release, featuring one of the earliest examples of a [[blast beat]] on record. Afterwards, the project was put on hold as Ian and Benante turned their focus back on Anthrax.

The US tour to support ''Spreading the Disease'' opening for [[Black Sabbath]] was canceled after four dates due to Sabbath singer [[Glenn Hughes (English singer)|Glenn Hughes]]' voice problems. In April 1986, Anthrax attempted its first tour of Europe beginning in Bochum, Germany, supported by [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] and [[Agent Steel]].<ref name="metallipromo">{{cite web |title=Anthrax ('82 - '92)|url=http://metallipromo.com/anthrax.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref> The tour included a show near Chernobyl, Ukraine, immediately after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].<ref name="Loudwire">{{cite web|first=Graham|last=Hartmann|url=http://loudwire.com/rob-caggiano-plays-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/|title=Rob Caggiano Plays Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|work=[[Loudwire]]|date=July 9, 2014|access-date=July 10, 2014}}</ref> Later that year, Anthrax toured Europe with Metallica.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The tour began on September 10 at [[St David's Hall]] and ended on September 26 in Solnahallen, Sweden. The Swedish show was Anthrax's last performance before the bus accident the following day, which killed Metallica bassist [[Cliff Burton]].<ref name="metallipromo"/>

The band's third studio album ''[[Among the Living]]'' was released in March 1987, and is often considered by both the band and critics to be a major breakthrough for Anthrax.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Produced by [[Eddie Kramer]], it showcased the band's humorous, experimental side and began a lyrical trend focusing on movies, politics, comic books and [[Stephen King]] novels. The album was dedicated to Cliff Burton's memory. Propelled by the singles "[[Indians (song)|Indians]]" and "[[I Am the Law (song)|I Am the Law]]", the success of ''Among the Living'' not only turned Anthrax into a household name (along with the remaining "big four" of thrash metal–Metallica, [[Megadeth]] and [[Slayer]]), but eventually earned them one of their first [[Music recording certification|certified-gold records]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="RIAA"/> "I Am the Law", which was released as the album's second single, was backed with a rap-metal hybrid "[[I'm the Man (EP)|I'm the Man]]" as its B-side.<ref name="LarkinHR"/><ref name=BW_Heavy_Metal/> Anthrax further indulged its appreciation for rap by appearing on the title track of [[U.T.F.O.]]'s album, ''Lethal'', and their worship for the genre was also attributed to Ian wearing a t-shirt of [[Public Enemy]] both on stage and for publicity photo shoots; in response, Public Enemy name-checked Anthrax in the lyrics to their 1988 single "[[Bring the Noise]]".<ref>{{cite news|first=Henry|last=Yates|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-the-song-bring-the-noise-by-anthrax-and-public-enemy|title=The Story Behind The Song: Anthrax and Public Enemy's Bring The Noise|website=[[Metal Hammer|loudersound.com]]|date=March 14, 2019|access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref> Anthrax toured for over a year to promote ''Among the Living'', touring Europe again with Metallica, the United States with [[Metal Church]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]], [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and [[Celtic Frost]], and supporting [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their ''[[Crazy Nights]]'' tour.<ref name="metallipromo"/>

Anthrax released their fourth album ''[[State of Euphoria]]'' in September 1988, and it was produced by [[Mark Dodson (record producer)|Mark Dodson]], who had previously worked with [[Judas Priest]], [[U.D.O.]] and [[Metal Church]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/> While the album was not quite as well-received as ''Among the Living'', owing to its "rushed"<ref>{{cite web|title=ANTHRAX: 'State Of Euphoria' 30th-Anniversary Deluxe Reissue Details Revealed|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anthrax-complete-state-of-euphoria-30th-anniversary-deluxe-reissue-details-revealed/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=August 30, 2018|access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ANTHRAX's CHARLIE BENANTE On 'State Of Euphoria' Album: 'All Of Us In The Band Felt That It Was Not Finished' |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anthraxs-charlie-benante-on-state-of-euphoria-album-all-of-us-in-the-band-felt-that-it-was-not-finished/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 20, 2018|access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref> finish, ''State of Euphoria'' was certified gold about five months after its release,<ref name="RIAA"/> and one of the singles "[[Antisocial (Trust song)|Antisocial]]", originally by French heavy metal band [[Trust (French band)|Trust]], became an MTV staple as part of the rotation on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''. By 1989, Anthrax was starting to play at arenas as a headlining or opening act, first supporting [[Ozzy Osbourne]] on his ''[[No Rest for the Wicked (Ozzy Osbourne album)|No Rest for the Wicked]]'' [[No Rest for the Wicked Tour|tour]] in North America, and then headlining European tours with [[Living Colour]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]] and [[King's X]], and the U.S. [[Headbangers Ball Tour]] with [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and [[Helloween]].<ref name="metallipromo"/> Also in 1989, MTV sponsored a contest in which the winner had her home trashed by the band. This would later inspire Anthrax's 1992 appearance on the television series ''[[Married... with Children]]'', in which the Bundys win a similar TV contest.<ref name="Loudwire"/>

Anthrax returned to the studio at the end of 1989 to work on their fifth album, again with Dodson as the producer.<ref name="Loudwire PoT">{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/anthrax-persistence-of-time-album-anniversary/|title=31 Years Ago: Anthrax Release 'Persistence of Time'|website=[[Loudwire]]|access-date=October 1, 2021}}</ref> Released in August 1990, ''[[Persistence of Time]]'' was written and recorded during a period of turmoil for Anthrax, as Ian had recently been divorced from his first wife, and the middle of the recording session was interrupted by a fire that caused the band to lose more than $100,000 worth of gear and their rehearsal studio.<ref name="LarkinHR"/><ref name="Loudwire PoT"/> The band members also claimed it was during this period that there were talks of potentially working with a different singer, a situation that Belladonna was unaware of at the time. Considered by fans to be their serious effort, ''Persistence of Time'' was darker, more technical and more progressive than the band's previous work, striking a chord with metal fans wary of Anthrax's "silly" side.<ref name="Loudwire PoT"/> The most successful single from the album was a cover of [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]]'s "Got the Time",<ref name="LarkinHR"/> which Jackson said he enjoyed. ''Persistence of Time'' was certified gold by the RIAA in early 1991,<ref name="RIAA"/> and the band toured for nearly two years to promote the album, opening for [[Iron Maiden]] on their ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'' [[No Prayer on the Road|tour]] in Europe and North America, and appearing on the [[Clash of the Titans (tour)|Clash of the Titans]] tour with [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]] and opening act [[Alice in Chains]].<ref name="Loudwire PoT"/>

In 1991, Anthrax collaborated with [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] on a version of "[[Bring the Noise]]".<ref name="LarkinHR"/> This was a hit, and a successful tour with Public Enemy followed.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> "Bring the Noise" has been a live staple for Anthrax since they first played it in concert in 1989.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bring the Noise by Anthrax Concert Statistics|website=setlist.fm|url=https://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/public-enemy-63d686a3.html?artist=7bd68e98&song=Bring+the+Noise|access-date=August 24, 2018}}</ref> The compilation ''[[Attack of the Killer B's]]'' was released in 1991,<ref name="LarkinHR"/> and featured three tracks from their 1989 EP ''[[Penikufesin]]'', a new version of "I'm the Man" and a cover of "Bring the Noise" on which Ian did some vocals.

In early 1992, shortly after signing a $10 million record deal with [[Elektra Records]] and following their appearance in ''Married... with Children'', Belladonna was fired from Anthrax over creative and stylistic differences.<ref name="LarkinHR" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=1992-03-15 |title=ELEKTRACUTION: You can understand if the Elektra... |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-03-15-ca-6440-story.html |access-date=2023-04-01 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> After firing Belladonna, the remaining members of Anthrax auditioned several vocalists including Mark Osegueda of [[Death Angel]] and Spike Xavier of [[Mind Over Four]].<ref>Scott Ian and Jon Weiderhorn (2014).

Despite hardships and legal entanglements over album rights, Anthrax continued. In 2001, [[Rob Caggiano]] joined the band on lead guitar. During the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the United States the band changed its website, providing information about the disease after people began searching "anthrax.com" on internet search engines. Amid a potential [[public relations|PR]] nightmare, Anthrax issued a press release on October 10, 2001, joking that the band's name would be changed to "something more friendly, like 'Basket Full of Puppies'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthrax.com/html/ANTHRAX_PressRelease.htm |title=Anthrax: Press Release |publisher=Anthrax.com |date=November 8, 2004 |access-date=October 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041108091742/http://www.anthrax.com/html/ANTHRAX_PressRelease.htm |archive-date=November 8, 2004 }}</ref> Anthrax dispelled any name-change rumors derived from the press release at the November 2001 [[New York Steel]] 9/11 [[benefit concert]], when they took the stage in [[Boilersuit|boiler suits]] with a different word on each one which ultimately read "We're not changing our name".

In 2003, the band signed to [[Sanctuary Records]] and released their ninth studio album ''[[We've Come for You All]]'', praised by metal journalists as a return to form.<ref>{{cite web |title=We've Come for You All - Anthrax |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/weve-come-for-you-all-mw0000592708 |website=Allmusic |access-date=10 July 2020}}</ref> The band then spent the summer of 2003 on tour with [[Motörhead]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Motörhead/Anthrax: First North American Tour Dates Announced |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mot-rhead-anthrax-first-north-american-tour-dates-announced/ |website=Blabbermouth |date=March 12, 2003 |access-date=10 July 2020}}</ref>

In early 2004, Anthrax released ''[[The Greater of Two Evils]]'', a "live in the studio" re-recording of the earlier work with the band's then-current lineup.

===Reunions with Belladonna and Bush (2005–2010)===
In April 2005, Anthrax announced that the "classic" lineup of Scott Ian, Charlie Benante, Dan Spitz, Joey Belladonna and Frank Bello would reform. At some shows on the following tour, they played ''Among the Living'' in its entirety.<ref>{{cite news|title=It's Official: Anthrax's 'Among The Living' Lineup To Reunite|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/it-s-official-anthrax-s-among-the-living-lineup-to-reunite/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=March 24, 2005|access-date=May 31, 2014}}</ref> Although the lineup was expected to record a new album after the tour, in January 2007 Ian said that Belladonna had not agreed to a reunion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anthrax-guitarist-scott-ian-the-reunion-is-over/|title=Anthrax Guitarist Scott Ian: 'The Reunion Is Over'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 24, 2007|access-date=January 14, 2010}}</ref> John Bush also said he wasn't ready to re-commit to Anthrax and said he had been asked to return but had declined.

In December 2007, it was announced that the band's new vocalist would be [[Dan Nelson]], formerly of Devilsize,<ref>{{cite news|title=It's Official: Anthrax Taps Former Devilsize Singer|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/it-s-official-anthrax-taps-former-devilsize-singer/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=December 10, 2007|access-date=July 22, 2009}}</ref> and Rob Caggiano would return as lead guitarist. In May 2008, Anthrax played its first show in 19 months at [[Double Door]] in Chicago.

In his monthly Food Coma column posted in December 2008, Scott Ian wrote that he had "been in the studio working on the new Anthrax album", promising to be "giving birth to a really pissed off, loud, fast and heavy child."<ref>{{cite web|first=Scott |last=Ian |url=http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/23475/ |title=A Festive Feast of Awesomeness |publisher=[[SuicideGirls.com]] |date=December 22, 2008 |access-date=December 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223125611/http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/23475/ |archive-date=December 23, 2008 }}</ref> He later wrote that the album was being mixed by [[Dave Fortman]], who had worked with [[Evanescence]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Scott |last=Ian |url=http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/23687/ |title=Scott Ian's Food Coma: Uncorking Wine and Led Zep |publisher=[[SuicideGirls.com]] |date=May 18, 2009 |access-date=May 26, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522130549/http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/23687/ |archive-date=May 22, 2009 }}</ref>

In early 2009, Anthrax began a brief tour opening for [[Iron Maiden]] in South America. In July, band manager Izvor Zivkovic confirmed the departure of Dan Nelson due to illness. Nelson denied this, saying that he was fired.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-anthrax-singer-dan-nelson-i-was-ready-willing-and-able-to-do-my-job/|title=Former Anthrax Singer Dan Nelson: 'I Was Ready, Willing And Able To Do My Job'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=July 21, 2009|access-date=May 30, 2014}}</ref> All subsequent performances were canceled except the August UK Sonisphere Festival, which featured John Bush on vocals.

Soon afterwards, Benante said that Bush had rejoined the band. In February 2010, Anthrax performed five shows as part of [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]] in Australia. After the Australian shows, Bush said the band intended to re-record the vocals of several tracks from the upcoming album.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ryan|last=Ogle|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/john-bush-says-timing-is-right-for-anthrax-s-reunion-with-joey-belladonna/|title=John Bush Says 'Timing Is Right' For Anthrax's Reunion With Joey Belladonna|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 19, 2010|access-date=May 30, 2014}}</ref>

In late 2009, Anthrax confirmed their participation in several "Big Four" concerts with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer as part of the 2010 [[Sonisphere Festival]] dates in Europe.
