'''Great White''' is an American [[hard rock]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1977. The band is named after both the [[Great White Shark|shark with the same name]], and guitarist Mark Kendall's former stage nickname. In August 2008, Great White estimated they had sold around eight million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview of Great White (Mark Kendall) for the "Back To The Rhythm" release |url=http://www.auxportesdumetal.com/interviews/greatwhite-uk.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923180554/http://www.auxportesdumetal.com/interviews/greatwhite-uk.html |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |access-date=October 8, 2013 |publisher=Auxportesdumetal.com}}</ref>

The band peaked with several albums during the mid-to-late 1980s, including the platinum-selling records ''[[Once Bitten (Great White album)|Once Bitten]]'' (1987) and ''[[...Twice Shy]]'' (1989),<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Great%20White&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum – RIAA|publisher=riaa.com|access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref> and those albums' singles "[[Rock Me (Great White song)|Rock Me]]" and "[[Once Bitten, Twice Shy]]" received considerable airplay through radio and [[MTV]].<ref name="KNAC">{{Cite web|url=http://people.delphi.com/dkasper13/knac/knaca2z.html|title=KNAC A to Z Listing|date=March 5, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000305154225/http://people.delphi.com/dkasper13/knac/knaca2z.html|access-date=July 29, 2021|archive-date=March 5, 2000}}</ref><ref name="Z-Rock">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklists.com/alltime52.html|title=Z-Rock Top 1001 Songs of All-Time (1990)|website=rocklists.com|access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Headbangers Ball- The Unofficial Tribute Site – Episode Database|url=https://www.headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com/episode-database|work=headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com|access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref> They charted two Top 40 hit singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with "Once Bitten, Twice Shy" and "[[The Angel Song (song)|The Angel Song]]."<ref name="Hot 100">{{cite magazine| url = https://www.billboard.com/music/great-white/chart-history| title = Great White: Chart History{{snd}}Hot 100| magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| access-date = April 13, 2020}}</ref> They continued to release new material into the 1990s.

Great White disbanded in 2001, with several members releasing solo material. By the following year, however, Mark Kendall had joined up with lead singer [[Jack Russell (musician)|Jack Russell]]'s solo touring band, and the group began performing as '''Jack Russell's Great White''',<ref name="jwgw" /> which also made headlines when, in 2003, their show [[pyrotechnics]] set a [[Rhode Island]] nightclub [[The Station nightclub fire|on fire]], leading to the deaths of 100 people, including band member Ty Longley.<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p4401 | title = Great White Biography | access-date =April 4, 2011 | last = Jeffries | first = David | work = [[AllMusic]] | publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]]}}</ref> In 2006, following a brief hiatus, the regular Great White reformed with other members of the classic lineup joining Russell and Kendall. 

After more than three decades as their singer, Russell left the band in 2011 and again began touring with a backing band under the name Jack Russell's Great White, until Russell's retirement and death in 2024. Great White has since continued on without Russell, who was first replaced by [[XYZ (American band)|XYZ]] vocalist [[Terry Ilous]], who stayed in the band until 2018 when [[Mitch Malloy]] replaced him. Malloy left in 2022 and was replaced by [[Andrew Freeman (musician)|Andrew Freeman]], later followed by Brett Carlisle the same year.

== History ==

=== Early career and first two albums (1977–1986) ===
Vocalist [[Jack Russell (musician)|Jack Russell]] met guitarist Mark Kendall in 1977, and Kendall asked Russell to join his band. They decided to form a band together and they called it Highway later changing it to Livewire and then played one final show as Wires. Then in 1979, Russell was arrested for shooting a live-in maid in a botched robbery attempt, and sentenced to eight years in prison. The band went its separate ways and Kendall was left to start over. He recruited bassist Don Costa (later a one-time member of [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and also briefly in [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sleazeroxx.com/rik-fox-recalls-being-briefly-replaced-by-don-costa-in-w-a-s-p-before-blackie-lawless-took-over-on-bass/|title=Rik Fox recalls being briefly replaced by Don Costa in W.A.S.P. before Blackie Lawless took over on bass – Sleaze Roxx|last=Olivier|date=May 19, 2019|language=en-CA|access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref>) and drummer [[Tony Richards (musician)|Tony Richards]] (later a member of W.A.S.P.). They auditioned several singers including [[John Bush (musician)|John Bush]] from [[Armored Saint]]. They then got a singer named Butch Say whose style was similar to that of [[Rob Halford]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myglobalmind.com/2014/06/27/interview-mark-kendall-guitar-great-white/|title=Interview with Mark Kendall (Guitar) (Great White)|date=June 27, 2014|website=Your Online Magazine for Hard Rock and Heavy Metal|language=en-US|access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref> but finally settled on a female singer Lisa Baker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-strange-and-terrible-true-story-of-great-white|title=The Strange And Terrible True Story Of Great White|last=Hotten|first=Jon|website=Classic Rock Magazine|date=September 10, 2016|language=en|access-date=January 31, 2020}}</ref> The name they decided to go with was Dante Fox. They played their first gig in 1979 with singer Lisa Baker and played around [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and the Los Angeles area for six months with Lisa, until she joined [[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]]'s band Xciter and Butch rejoined briefly. Later they found out that Russell was released from prison after serving only 18 months of his sentence and Russell talked Kendall into an audition and he got in the band by a two to one band vote. They played their first gig with Russell at [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|The Troubadour]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], [[California]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}
[[File:Great-White-band-1986.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Great White as a quartet in 1986. From left: Lorne Black, Mark Kendall, Jack Russell, Audie Desbrow.]]
After recording several demos, the band chose as manager [[Alan Niven]], who had worked for the independent distributor Greenworld in [[Torrance, California]], and had dealt with [[Mötley Crüe]]'s debut self-release. Niven suggested the name change from Dante Fox after seeing Kendall stick his head out of a car window while driving by the Troubador and some kid in the crowd said "there goes Great White". Kendall got the nickname due to his naturally white-blonde hair, white [[Fender Telecaster]] guitar, white jumpsuit, and white [[Capezio]] shoes. In 1982, the members by this time (as Costa and Richards had left) were Mark Kendall, Jack Russell, drummer [[Gary Holland]], and bassist Lorne Black. They were soon in the studio and they recorded and released a 5-song [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Out of the Night]]'', on the independent label Aegean formed by Niven. Niven then convinced the Los Angeles radio station [[KMET (defunct)|KMET]] to begin adding songs from the EP to its playlist in heavy rotation. [[KLOS]]-FM soon did the same. The band suddenly went from drawing 100 people to a local club to drawing thousands in L.A. concert halls such as Perkins Palace in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[Avalon Hollywood|The Palace]] in Hollywood and the Country Club in [[Reseda, Los Angeles|Reseda]]. As an unsigned act, Great White headlined at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]] playing to 6,250 people. Near the end of 1983, [[EMI]] America signed the band and subsequently released Great White's [[Great White (album)|eponymous]] debut album in early 1984. The band immediately toured the UK supporting [[Whitesnake]]'s ''[[Slide It In]]'' tour and the entire US and Canada opening for [[Judas Priest]]'s ''[[Defenders of the Faith]]'' tour. They also supported [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their ''[[Lick It Up]]'' tour. ''[[Shot in the Dark (Great White album)|Shot in the Dark]]'', their follow-up independent release, marked the arrival of drummer Audie Desbrow after the firing of Holland on December 27, 1984.<ref>As per Jack Russell, former vocalist of Great White.</ref> By the time [[Capitol Records]] signed the band and reissued ''Shot in the Dark'', keyboardist-guitarist [[Michael Lardie]], who had played on that album as a session musician, had come aboard as a full member. After the release of ''Shot in the Dark'', Great White hit the road with [[Dokken]] for 5 shows and was on the verge of even bigger success.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Great White – The Vogue |url=https://thevogue.com/artists/great-white/ |access-date=2024-06-08 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Mainstream success (1987–1992) ===
The band hit the mainstream in 1987 when they released their third album ''[[Once Bitten (Great White album)|Once Bitten]]'', accompanied by the hits "[[Rock Me (Great White song)|Rock Me]]", "[[Save Your Love (Great White song)|Save Your Love]]" and "Lady Red Light", all of which received significant airplay on [[album-oriented rock|mainstream rock radio stations]] such as [[KNAC]] and [[Z Rock]].<ref name="KNAC" /><ref name="Z-Rock" /><ref name="allmusic-bio" /> The model Tracy Martinson appeared on the cover of the album and also appeared in the video for "Save Your Love". In late 1987, Great White parted ways with bassist Lorne Black and replaced him with Tony Montana (Tony Cardenas).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metalforcesmagazine.com/site/feature-great-white-mf25/ | title=GREAT WHITE – Putting the Colour Back into White (MF25, 1987) &#124; Features / Interviews @ Metal Forces Magazine }}</ref><ref name="Blabbermouth" /> ''Once Bitten...'' was [[platinum certification|certified platinum]] in April 1988,<ref name="RIAA" /> and a year-long tour in support of the album cemented Great White's popularity worldwide, performing with [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Whitesnake]], [[David Lee Roth]] and [[TNT (Norwegian band)|TNT]], and appearing on several dates as part the European [[Monsters of Rock]] tour in the summer of 1988 with several acts such as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Iron Maiden]], Guns N' Roses, David Lee Roth, [[Megadeth]], [[Helloween]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/great-white?page=9#concert-table |title=Great White's Concert & Tour History |website=concertarchives.org |access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnrontour.com/setlistalm88.htm |title=G n' R 1988 Setlist Almanac|website=Gnrontour.com |access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vharchives.com/dlrtour1988 |title=G n' R 1988 Setlist Almanac |website=Vharchives.com |access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.themonstersofrock.com/concerts |title=Concerts – Monsters of Rock |website=Themonstersofrock.com |access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref>

The band followed up with ''[[...Twice Shy]]'' in 1989. The album included their biggest hit, "[[Once Bitten, Twice Shy]]", a cover of a UK hit single by [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]]; this is Great White's only single to date that has achieved gold certification.<ref name="RIAA" /> The model [[Bobbie Brown]] (also known for being in [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]]'s "[[Cherry Pie (Warrant song)|Cherry Pie]]" video) appeared in the video for "Once Bitten, Twice Shy". Other songs from the album, including "[[The Angel Song (song)|The Angel Song]]", "[[House of Broken Love]]", "Mista Bone" and "Move It", received significant attention as well, through radio airplay or otherwise.<ref name="KNAC" /><ref name="Z-Rock" /> ''...Twice Shy'' was certified platinum in July 1989, then double platinum in September two months later,<ref name="RIAA" /> and received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The album was supported by a successful world tour that saw Great White performing at arenas and stadiums, including sharing the stage with [[Bon Jovi]], [[Ratt]], [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], [[Kix (band)|Kix]], Warrant, [[Badlands (American band)|Badlands]] and [[Britny Fox]], and supporting [[Alice Cooper]] on his ''[[Trash (Alice Cooper album)|Trash]]'' tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/great-white?page=7#concert-table |title=Great White's Concert & Tour History |website=Concertarchives.org |access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/great-white?page=8#concert-table |title=Great White's Concert & Tour History |website=Concertarchives.org |access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref>

In 1990, the band featured in the heavy metal video series ''Hard 'N' Heavy'' containing music, concert footage and interviews. The video included [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Duff McKagan]] from [[Guns N' Roses]] appearing with the band at a Children of the Night Benefit concert in L.A., the performance helping to raise money for housing abused homeless children.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.snakepit.org/discvid.html | title = Slash Video Appearances | access-date = April 4, 2011 | date = October 2005 | publisher = Slash's Official Fan Site | quote = SLASH, Duff McKagan and Great White appear in footage from the Children of the Night Benefit in Los Angeles. | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727172439/http://www.snakepit.org/discvid.html | archive-date = July 27, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh-3WS6bYqg | title = great white w/ slash n duff – jam @ children of the night | access-date = April 4, 2011 | date = March 27, 2006 | publisher = [[YouTube]] | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140707192208/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh-3WS6bYqg | archive-date = July 7, 2014 }}</ref> Both bands shared the same manager, Alan Niven, at the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The band continued into the next decade performing the song "House of Broken Love" at the [[American Music Awards]] in January 1990. In March, Great White embarked on their first tour of Japan. They returned to the United States for the [[Memorial Day]] weekend festival dubbed [[The World Series of Rock]], which featured Whitesnake, [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], [[Bad English]], and Hericane Alice. Great White recorded two more albums for Capitol Records, ''[[Hooked (Great White album)|Hooked]]'', which was certified gold,<ref name="RIAA" /> and ''[[Psycho City]]''. In support of ''Hooked'', Great White did a tour as opener for the German metal band [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] and traveled to Europe and Japan. During this tour Mark Kendall was hospitalized for a hiatal hernia for 3 weeks and then returned. Guitarist [[Al Pitrelli]] was asked to fill in for Mark during his absence. ''Psycho City'' was followed by a US tour with [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

=== Years of commercial decline and disbandment (1993–2001) ===
Capitol issued the [[compilation album|compilation]] ''[[The Best of Great White: 1986–1992]]'' in 1993, when Great White had already departed the label to begin work on their next studio release, ''[[Sail Away (Great White album)|Sail Away]]''. Before the release of the album, Great White spent seven months on the road headlining clubs. According to Lardie, it was "the longest stint we ever did without a break".{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Great White kept up the pace once ''Sail Away'' was released on [[Zoo Records]] in 1994, touring the US several times over the following year and a half. Their next release, ''[[Let It Rock (Great White album)|Let It Rock]]'', was released in 1996 through yet another label, [[Imago Records]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}<!-- [[Paula Cole]] article says Imago went out of business in 1994.-->

In 1999, the band released ''[[Can't Get There from Here (album)|Can't Get There from Here]]'' and embarked on a tour with [[Ratt]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], and [[L.A. Guns]]. The album featured the single "Rollin' Stoned", which managed to chart at No.&nbsp;8 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In a memo dated January 20, 2000, Mark Kendall announced he was taking a hiatus from Great White. Shortly thereafter both Audie Desbrow and [[Sean McNabb]] left Great White. Russell would continue to tour with only Michael Lardie staying. Desbrow, clearly very unhappy with the financial state of the band and Russell's relapse in addiction, posted a tirade on his website lambasting Jack Russell while claiming to have been "fired" from Great White.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-sludge.com/DesbrowRant.htm |title=Great White Drummer Gets Fired and Goes Off on the Band |access-date=April 4, 2011 |last=Desbrow |first=Audie |date=September 20, 2000 |publisher=Metal Sludge|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010210023202/http://www.metal-sludge.com/DesbrowRant.htm |archive-date=February 10, 2001 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Meanwhile, it was rumored that Sean McNabb was fired for going to management and asking to see the accounting books, though this was debunked by Desbrow, who stated that both he and McNabb had done so several times before getting fired.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=216&Itemid=52 | title = 20 Questions with Ex-Great White Drummer Audie Desbrow | access-date = April 4, 2011 | date = September 26, 2000 | publisher =Metal Sludge | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927222108/http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=216&Itemid=52 | archive-date = September 27, 2011 }}</ref> McNabb would later on state that his reason for being fired was because of his own addiction problems.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://sleazeroxx.com/sean-mcnabb-recalls-getting-fired-from-great-white-two-and-a-half-weeks-before-station-nightclub-fire/ |title=Sean McNabb recalls getting fired from Great White two and a half weeks before Station Nightclub fire |publisher=Sleaze Roxx |date=September 5, 2020 |access-date=February 10, 2024 }}</ref> The band announced plans to begin work on a new album in late 2000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Great White Official Statement, 20 September 2000 |url=http://www.mistabone.com/news/mgmt092000.shtml |website=mistabone.com |access-date=20 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416145353/http://www.mistabone.com/news/mgmt092000.shtml |archive-date=16 April 2007 |date=20 September 2000 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Early in the process, some of the new songs were played for [[John Kalodner]] at [[Columbia Records]].

=== Reunion, the Station nightclub fire incident and aftermath (2002–2009) ===

By late 2002, following a relatively unsuccessful change in music direction with his second solo album, Jack Russell contacted Kendall, who was struggling with irrelevancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1heavymetal.com/interviews/greatwhite.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011045829/http://www.1heavymetal.com/interviews/greatwhite.htm |archive-date=October 11, 2008 |title=Great White 9/3/2003 Interview at www.1heavymetal.com |date=October 11, 2008 |access-date=October 18, 2011}}</ref> Kendall agreed to play some dates with Russell's band.<ref name="jwgw">{{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=7350 | title = Jack Russell To Bring Great White Back To Life On Upcoming Tour | access-date = April 4, 2011 | date = November 2, 2002 | work = [[Blabbermouth.net]] | publisher = [[Roadrunner Records]] | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090708164250/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=7350 | archive-date = July 8, 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Billed as "Jack Russell's Great White", the tour was to consist primarily of classic songs from the Great White catalog with some of Russell's solo work mixed in.

The band returned to the national spotlight on February 20, 2003. At the beginning of a Great White performance at [[The Station nightclub fire|The Station]] night club in [[Rhode Island]], [[pyrotechnics]] used by the band's crew created a spray of sparks that ignited the makeshift and unapproved, unlisted foam soundproofing material affixed to the walls and ceiling around the stage. The soundproofing material was installed to help alleviate area neighbor noise complaints before the fire. One hundred people, including guitarist Ty Longley, died in the fire that followed. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Boston.com / News / Specials / R.I. nightclub fire |url=http://cache.boston.com/news/packages/nightclub_fire/victims/tlongley.htm |access-date=2024-09-24 |website=cache.boston.com}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-great-white-nightclub-fire-ten-years-later-20130715|title=The Great White Nightclub Fire: Ten Years Later|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=September 25, 2017}}</ref> His son Acey Ty Christopher Longley was born in the summer of 2003.<ref>{{cite news | last= Grossberg | first= Josh | title= Great White Guitarist Declared Dead | date= February 24, 2003 | publisher= [[E!]] Online | url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,11323,00.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last= Mervis | first= Scott | title= After the fire: Great White, survivors live with the horror of Rhode Island tragedy | date= March 25, 2005 | newspaper= [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05084/477106.stm}}</ref> and is also a musician, running a charity called B.E.A.T.S.

By 2011, Great White was touring regularly with Ilous fronting the band, as they continued waiting for Russell to fully recover and return as lead singer.<ref>[https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/great-white-guitarist-discusses-band-s-singer-situation/ "GREAT WHITE Guitarist Discusses Band's Singer Situation," 30 May 2011. @Blabbermouth.net] Retrieved March 13, 2022.</ref> The band appeared to be on good terms with Russell even as late as August 2011, when Kendall stated in an interview that the group were still actively awaiting his return to the stage, further indicating that Russell was not only supportive of the current situation, but even checking in with Ilous on occasion to give the latter encouragement and thank him for doing such a great job singing Great White's songs. However, Kendall did also state during this interview that while he and his bandmates were eager for Russell to rejoin, they did want to make sure the time was right and that "when he's back[,] he's back all the way."<ref name="Roadrunner">{{cite web | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=167166 | title=Singer JACK RUSSELL Launches New Version Of GREAT WHITE | publisher=Blabbermouth.net | date=December 12, 2011 | access-date=January 9, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108055945/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=167166 | archive-date=January 8, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> A later interview with Kendall provided additional detail, indicating that the band had initially hoped Russell would rejoin by the early summer of 2011, but that he was not in any condition to return at that time. Kendall also mentioned that the band had several stipulations that Russell would need to meet to return to the lineup, and that Russell himself had set a new target return date of February 2012, meaning he would not be performing with Great White for the remainder of 2011.<ref name="Metalinsider">[https://metalinsider.net/metal-musical-chairs/now-there%E2%80%99s-two-versions-of-great-white Shaw, Zach (2011).

Before the year's end, however, Russell had apparently become impatient or disenchanted with this arrangement. In December 2011, just days after informing the band that (on advice from his doctor) he would not be able to rejoin by the February target date, he obtained a licensing agreement from Great White, and formed a new incarnation of Great White with a brand-new lineup under the name of Jack Russell's Great White.<ref name="Roadrunner" /><ref name="Metalinsider" /> The other band members immediately voiced their surprise and strong objection to this move and said that "Jack Russell does not have the right to start his own Great White or use the name without our names in the lineup.
