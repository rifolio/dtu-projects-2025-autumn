'''Seether''' are<!-- NOTE: "are" is correct South African English. Do NOT change to "is" Addl NOTE: only in Afrikaans; though traditional English is a minority language, it still is based somewhat on UK English.--> a South African [[Rock music|rock]] band founded in 1999 in [[Pretoria]], [[Gauteng]]. The band originally performed under the name Saron Gas until 2002, when they moved to the United States and changed it to Seether to avoid confusion with the deadly chemical known as [[sarin|sarin gas]]. Lead vocalist and guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]] is the band's longest serving member, bassist [[Dale Stewart]] joined shortly after formation while drummer [[John Humphrey (drummer)|John Humphrey]] joined them for the band's second album. Since 2018, the band has been employing second guitarist [[Corey Lowery]]. Several notable guitarists like Corey's brother [[Clint Lowery|Clint]] and [[Troy McLawhorn]] have toured or recorded with the band; however, Morgan has recorded most guitar parts for the band's records.

Seether gained mainstream popularity in 2002 with their US Active Rock number one single "[[Fine Again]]". Their success was sustained in 2004 with the single "[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]", which peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. They have experienced continued success with many number one hits on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, such as "[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]", "[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]", "[[Country Song (Seether song)|Country Song]]", "[[Tonight (Seether song)|Tonight]]", "[[Words as Weapons (Seether song)|Words as Weapons]]", "[[Let You Down (Seether song)|Let You Down]]", "[[Dangerous (Seether song)|Dangerous]]", "[[Bruised and Bloodied]]", and "Wasteland". The band has released nine studio albums; their most recent, ''[[The Surface Seems So Far]]'', was released in 2024.

==History==
===Formation as Saron Gas (1999–2001)===
The band formed in South Africa in May 1999 under the name Saron Gas.<ref name="AllMusicBio">{{cite web|author=Bradley Torreano |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/seether-mn0000625731/biography |title=Seether &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref> Consisting of [[frontman]], vocalist, and guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist Tyronne Morris (who left the band in December 1999 and was replaced by Dale Stewart in January 2000), drummer Dave Cohoe, and guitarist Johan Greyling (who departed shortly after the band's formation), Saron Gas released their first album, ''Fragile'', in October 2000 under [[Johannesburg]]-based [[independent record label]] Musketeer Records.<ref name="AllMusicBio"/> Despite the region's focus primarily on [[pop music|pop]] and [[indigenous music]], the band found success, and eventually caught attention of American record label [[Wind-up Records]], who gave them a record deal to begin releasing music in [[North America]].<ref name="AllMusicBio"/> Upon signing to the label, they were told they needed to change their name due to its similarity to [[sarin gas]], and switched to calling themselves [[Seether (song)|Seether]], after the [[Veruca Salt]] song. Around the same time, Cohoe departed from the band. His replacement on drums was not immediately named.<ref name="AXS1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.axs.com/seether-5-most-pivotal-moments-84248|title=Seether: 5 most pivotal moments - AXS|work=AXS |date=17 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517104228/http://www.axs.com/seether-5-most-pivotal-moments-84248|access-date=6 October 2020|archive-date=17 May 2016}}</ref>

===''Disclaimer'' releases (2002–2004)===
In August 2002, Seether launched their first official album, ''Disclaimer'', which earned the band three singles: "[[Fine Again]]", "Driven Under", and "[[Gasoline (Seether song)|Gasoline]]", in which only the first managed significant success. "Fine Again" was also included in the video games ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' in 2002 and ''[[1080° Avalanche]]'' in 2003. After utilizing session drummers on ''Disclaimer'', the band brought in Nick Oshiro as the full-time drummer. In addition, Patrick Callahan was added to the lineup as a second guitarist.

Following the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured continually in order to increase sales and gain name recognition. A planned second album was delayed for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an Evanescence worldwide tour. Seether reworked their [[acoustic music|acoustic]] ballad "[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]" into an electric ballad with guest vocals by [[Amy Lee]] of Evanescence. Favourable audience response led the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled "Sold Me", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A romance developed between Lee and Morgan during this time.

Morgan has stated that the reworking of "Broken" was due to the wishes of the record company rather than those of the band.<ref name=fastloud>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |title=Seether feels the cold on |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=18 July 2006 |access-date=17 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011051304/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |archive-date=11 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> An alternate version of the original album, with many of its songs [[remix]]ed or re-recorded, was released in June 2004 and entitled ''[[Disclaimer II]]''. The alternate version also featured eight extra tracks. Prior to the recording of ''Disclaimer II'', Oshiro left the band in order to join [[Static-X]], and he was replaced on drums by John Humphrey.

===''Karma and Effect'' (2005–2006)===
Seether's follow-up album, ''[[Karma and Effect]]'', was released in May 2005. Originally titled ''Catering to Cowards'', the name was changed due to the record label's demand.<ref name=vh1>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1501650/20050511/seether.jhtml |title=Seether : Seether Frontman Shaun Morgan Is Very Angry |publisher=VH1.com |access-date=17 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901033029/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1501650/20050511/seether.jhtml |archive-date=1 September 2009 }}</ref> ''Karma and Effect'' debuted at number 8 on the US Billboard 200 album charts and was certified gold in the US and Canada. The album spawned three singles, "[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]", "[[Truth (Seether song)|Truth]]", and "[[The Gift (Seether song)|The Gift]]". "Remedy" reached number 1 on the US Mainstream Rock Charts, Seether's first number 1 hit.

Seether released an acoustic CD/DVD set titled ''[[One Cold Night]]'', recorded at the Grape Street Club in [[Philadelphia]], on 22 February 2006. Morgan had been suffering from a stomach ailment, and decided to do an acoustic performance of their set rather than cancel the show. The exclusion of "Needles" and "Burrito" from the album is due to the label's desire that it contain no obscenities.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title=Seether|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/seether-tickets/index.html|publisher=Frontrowking.com|access-date=8 May 2014}}</ref>

Guitarist Callahan's departure from the band was announced on 15 June 2006. His last performance with them was on 3 June.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris-Harris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1534375/seether-lose-guitarist-frontman-credits-stomach-with-acoustic-night/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609165247/http://www.mtv.com/news/1534375/seether-lose-guitarist-frontman-credits-stomach-with-acoustic-night/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 June 2017 |title=Seether Lose Guitarist; Frontman Credits Stomach With Acoustic Night |website=Mtv.com |date=15 June 2006 |access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>  Pat was later interviewed on a radio show in Philadelphia where he said his departure was not anything musical, but he and the singer Shaun had a "personality" clash and were not seeing eye to eye, and just couldn't work things out, but was still very friendly with the other two members. Pat also did not like certain band decisions. One example was the band being on the Punisher and Daredevil soundtrack in which he did not like the lineup of bands they were associated with. [[Shaun Morgan]] himself later commented on Pat's departure:
:"''Um... relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason 'cause he was my friend for four years. But when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him.''"<ref name=fastloud/>

Morgan entered a rehabilitation program for what he felt was "dependence on a combination of substances" in August 2006, which forced the band to cancel a tour with [[Staind]] and [[Three Days Grace]].<ref name="MTV2007">{{cite web |title=Seether Frontman Enters Rehab; August Tour Dates Canceled - MTV |author=Chris Harris |website=[[MTV]] |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1537141/seether-frontman-enters-rehab-august-tour-dates-canceled/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606073015/http://www.mtv.com/news/1537141/seether-frontman-enters-rehab-august-tour-dates-canceled/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 June 2014 |date=26 July 2006 |access-date=15 September 2019}}</ref>

===''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' (2007–2009)===
[[File:USMC-101217-M-2339L-028.jpg|thumb|Seether performing in 2008]]
Shaun Morgan, prior to the next album's release, claimed that it would be more diverse than previous efforts. ''[[Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces]]'' was slated for an August 2007 release but was delayed until 23 October 2007 due to the [[suicide]] of Morgan's brother, Eugene Welgemoed. The album debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, and sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Its cover artwork featured "Candice the Ghost", and was illustrated by [[David Ho (artist)|David Ho]]. The first single, "[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]", reached the top position of the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, and held that spot for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It became the theme for [[WWE]]'s [[No Way Out (2008)]]. "[[Rise Above This]]", written for Eugene Welgemoed, was released as a single and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and No.&nbsp;2 on its mainstream counterpart, [[Mainstream Rock Songs]]. The final single from the album was "Breakdown", the video for which was released on 12 November 2008 after a delay from its original scheduled release date of 23 October. ''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' won Seether's first [[South African Music Awards|South African Music Award]] in the category "Best Rock: English", as well as their first [[MTV Africa Music Awards|MTV Africa Music Award]] for "Best Alternative Artist".

A tour launched in support of the album in early 2008 lasted much of the year. [[Troy McLawhorn]] of [[Dark New Day]], [[Evanescence]], and [[doubleDrive]] was hired as a touring guitarist on 15 February 2008. Bands Seether shared the stage with on the tour included [[Three Days Grace]], [[Finger Eleven]], [[Breaking Benjamin]], [[3 Doors Down]], [[Skillet (band)|Skillet]], [[Red (band)|Red]], [[Papa Roach]], [[Flyleaf (band)|Flyleaf]], [[Econoline Crush]], and Staind. McLawhorn was afterwards made an official member of the band.

"No Shelter" appeared on the [[NCIS (Soundtrack)|NCIS Official TV Soundtrack]], released on 10 February 2009, and a version of [[George Michael]]'s "[[Careless Whisper]]" was made available for purchase as a digital or mobile download.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Turkoglu |first1=Ceren |title=10 Seether Songs Ranked Worst to Best |url=https://rockinformer.com/seether-songs-ranked/ |website=Rock Informer |date=30 September 2023 |access-date=2 October 2023}}</ref> The song was reportedly covered as a joke,<ref>{{cite web|last=di monaco|first=lou|title=NY Rock Music Examiner exclusive interview w/ vocalist Shaun Morgan of Seether|url=http://99xonline.com/content/seether|work=examiner.com|access-date=23 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> in which the band turned an "80s pop ballad" into a hard rock/metal song in response to Wind-up's request that they record a Valentine's Day song. The music video for "Careless Whisper" premiered on 15 June 2009, and the song is included as an additional track on the reissue of ''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces''.

Seether supported [[Nickelback]] on their [[Dark Horse (Nickelback album)|Dark Horse]] tour in March and April 2009. Shaun and Dale confirmed in an interview on 2 March 2009 that, after the Nickelback tour, Seether would take the rest of year off to write and record the follow-up to ''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sig7-Dob71A |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |access-date=19 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022075801/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sig7-Dob71A |archive-date=22 October 2013 }}</ref> The band nevertheless gave performances through the remainder of the year, which included a date in Okinawa to play for American troops as part of a [[USO]] tour on 23 and 24 May at [[Camp Schwab]], and then in [[MCAS Iwakuni]] on 26 May for the [[US Marines]]. Seether also made appearances at a number of festivals during the summer, including sets at the Chippewa Valley Music Festival and the Quebec City Festival, before the tour's conclusion at [[The Eastern States Exposition|The Big E Festival]], [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]], on 4 October.

Seether covered the song "[[I've Got You Under My Skin]]" on the [[Frank Sinatra]] tribute album ''[[His Way, Our Way]]'', which came out on 7 July 2009.
