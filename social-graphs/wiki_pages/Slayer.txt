'''Slayer''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band from [[Huntington Park, California]], formed in 1981 by guitarists [[Kerry King]] and [[Jeff Hanneman]], drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] and bassist/vocalist [[Tom Araya]]. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the "big four" bands of [[thrash metal]], alongside [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer [[Paul Bostaph]] and guitarist [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]], who initially joined as a touring musician in 2011 before joining the band permanently after Hanneman's death in 2013. Drummer [[Jon Dette]] is a former member of the band.

In the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as [[serial killer]]s, [[occultism]], [[terrorism]], [[religion]], [[fascism]], [[racism]], and [[war]], have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups. However, its music has been highly influential, being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' (1986), has been described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.

Slayer released twelve studio albums, three live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received [[RIAA certification|gold certification]] in the United States. Slayer sold 5 million copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The band has received five [[Grammy Award]] nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song "[[Eyes of the Insane]]" and one in 2008 for the song "Final Six", both of which were from the album ''[[Christ Illusion]]'' (2006). Slayer disbanded in 2019 following the conclusion of a year-and-a-half long [[Slayer Farewell Tour|farewell tour]], but has reformed to perform sporadic reunion shows since 2024.

==History==
===Early years (1981–1983)===
[[File:Slayer 1983 press photo.png|left|thumb|Slayer in 1983. From left: Kerry King, Dave Lombardo, Jeff Hanneman, and Tom Araya.]]
Slayer was formed in 1981 by [[Jeff Hanneman]], [[Dave Lombardo]], [[Tom Araya]] and [[Kerry King]] in Huntington Park, California. The group started out playing covers of songs by bands such as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Venom (band)|Venom]] at parties and clubs in [[Southern California]]. The band's early image relied heavily on [[Satanism|Satanic]] themes that featured [[pentagram]]s, make-up, spikes, and inverted crosses.<ref name="AllMusic Biography of Slayer">{{cite web|url=https://www.AllMusic.com/artist/slayer-mn0000022124/biography|title=Slayer {{!}} Biography|author=Huey|first=Steve|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|access-date=January 11, 2018}}</ref> Rumors that the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the [[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|1981 film of the same name]], were denied by King, as he later stated: "We never were; it's a myth to this day."<ref name="Kerry King about the Dragonslayer myth, Christ Illusion, previous albums and experimenting">{{cite web|title=Kerry King about the Dragonslayer myth, Christ Illusion, previous albums and experimenting |publisher=www.faceculture.nl |date=October 20, 2006 |url=http://www.faceculture.nl/slayer/index.htm# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104230520/http://www.faceculture.nl/slayer/index.htm%23 |archive-date=January 4, 2007 |access-date=April 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to Lombardo, the original band name was to be Wings of Fire before they settled in with Slayer.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Enis |first=Eli |title=Slayer's Original Band Name Was Wildly Different |url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/slayers-original-band-name-was-wildly-different/ |access-date=2025-02-07 |website=Revolver |language=en-US}}</ref> According to him, he also designed the band logo.

In 1983, Slayer was invited to open for the band [[Bitch (band)|Bitch]] at the Woodstock Club in [[Anaheim, California]] to perform eight songs, six of which were covers. The band was spotted by [[Brian Slagel]], a former music journalist who had recently founded [[Metal Blade Records]]. Impressed with Slayer, he met with the band backstage and asked them to record an original song for his upcoming ''[[Metal Massacre#Metal Massacre III – 1983|Metal Massacre III]]'' compilation album. The band agreed and their song "Aggressive Perfector" created an underground buzz upon its release in mid-1983, which led to Slagel offering the band a [[recording contract]] with Metal Blade.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Waksman |first=Steve |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqDJjAeYxssC |title=This Ain't the Summer of Love: Conflict and Crossover in Heavy Metal and Punk |date=2009 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-94388-9 |editor-last=Waksman |editor-first=Steve |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=235 |doi=10.1525/9780520943889 |oclc=1399981480 |ol=29602596M}}</ref>

Araya noted in a 1991 [[Metal Forces]] interview that the band had written original songs in its early days that "were more in the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] and [[Iron Maiden]] vein", but they left those songs behind after rehearsing Aggressive Perfector extensively in preparation for the Metal Massacre album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.metalforcesmagazine.com/site/feature-slayer-mf66/|title=SLAYER – Total Devotion|author=Bernard Doe|website=[[Metal Forces]]|date=1991|issue=66|access-date=September 6, 2025}}</ref>

''[[Show No Mercy]]'', released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records, generated underground popularity for the band. The group began a club tour of California to promote the album. The tour gave the band additional popularity and sales of ''Show No Mercy'' eventually reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.<ref name="INTERVIEW WITH BRIAN SLAGEL">{{cite web |author=German, Eric |title=Interview with Brian Slagel |url=http://www.metalupdate.com/interviewmetalblade.html |access-date=December 4, 2006 |publisher=Metalupdate.com}}</ref>

In June 1984, Slayer released a three-track [[extended play|EP]] called ''[[Haunting the Chapel]]''.

Following the success of ''Hell Awaits'', Slayer was offered a recording contract with [[Russell Simmons]] and [[Rick Rubin]]'s newly founded [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam Records]], then a largely [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-based label.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> The band accepted, and with an experienced producer and [[major label]] recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album ''[[Reign in Blood]]'', resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. The complex arrangements and long songs featured on ''Hell Awaits'' were ditched in favor of stripped down, [[hardcore punk]] influenced song structures.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

Def Jam's distributor, [[Columbia Records]], refused to release the album due to the song "[[Angel of Death (Slayer song)|Angel of Death]]"<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> which detailed [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] [[concentration camp]]s and the [[human experiments]] conducted by Nazi physician [[Josef Mengele]].

Slayer began touring in support of ''Reign in Blood'' in late 1986 with [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]].<ref name="metalunderground">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=82810|title=Sunday Old School: Slayer|author=Diamond Oz|date=July 22, 2012|publisher=Metal Underground|access-date=February 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Beaugez|first=Jim|date=November 12, 2021|title=How 1986 Became The Epicenter Of A New Metal Sound: Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, And The Albums That Defined Thrash Metal|url=https://www.grammy.com/news/metallica-megadeth-slayer-anthrax-1986-new-metal-sound-albums-that-defined-thrash-interview|access-date=February 12, 2025|website=[[Grammy Awards|Grammy.com]]|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Sacher|first=Andrew|date=November 12, 2021|title=Listen to a newly unearthed Slayer concert recording from 1986|url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/listen-to-a-newly-unearthed-slayer-concert-recording-from-1986/|access-date=February 12, 2025|website=[[BrooklynVegan]]|language=en-US}}</ref> The band was added as the opening act on [[W.A.S.P.

In late 1987, Slayer returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of ''Reign in Blood'', the band consciously decided to slow down the [[tempo]]s and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, "We knew we couldn't top ''Reign in Blood'', so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've never done that on an album, before or since."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/>

On September 27, 1994, Slayer released ''[[Divine Intervention (Slayer album)|Divine Intervention]]'', the band's first album with Bostaph on the drums. The album featured songs about [[Reinhard Heydrich]], an architect of the Holocaust, and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], an American serial killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the evils of church, and the lengths to which governments went to wield power. Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much of the content of the lyrics.<ref name="Live Chat with Tom Araya of Slayer"/><ref name="Divine Intervention - Slayer">{{cite web|title=Divine Intervention – Slayer|author=Henderson, Alex|website=AllMusic|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r203780|pure_url=yes}}

Slayer geared up for a world tour in 1995, with openers [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] and [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]. A video of concert footage, ''[[Live Intrusion]],'' was released, featuring a joint [[cover song|cover]] of [[Venom (band)|Venom's]] "Witching Hour" with Machine Head. Following the tour, Slayer was billed third at the 1995 [[Monsters of Rock]] festival, headlined by [[Metallica]]. In 1996, ''[[Undisputed Attitude]]'', an album of [[Punk rock|punk]] [[cover version|covers]], was released. The band covered songs by [[Minor Threat]], [[T.S.O.L.]], [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles]], [[D.I. (band)|D.I.]], [[Verbal Abuse]], [[Dr. Know (band)|Dr. Know]], and [[The Stooges]]. The album featured three original tracks, "Gemini", "Can't Stand You", "DDAMM"; the latter two were written by Hanneman in 1984–1985 for a side project entitled Pap Smear. Bostaph left Slayer shortly after the album's recording to work on his own project, Truth About Seafood. With Bostaph's departure, Slayer recruited [[Testament (band)|Testament]] drummer [[Jon Dette]] and headlined the 1996 Ozzfest alongside [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], [[Sepultura]], and [[Fear Factory]]. Dette was fired after a year due to a fallout with band members.

Slayer toured playing ''Reign in Blood'' in its entirety throughout the fall of 2003, under the tour banner "Still Reigning".

The band also released ''[[War at the Warfield]]'' and a box set, ''[[Soundtrack to the Apocalypse]]'' featuring rarities, live CD and DVD performances and various Slayer merchandise.

===Cancelled thirteenth studio album, Final World Tour and split (2016–2019)===
In August 2016, King was asked if Slayer would release a follow-up to ''Repentless''. He replied, "We've got lots of leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote so much stuff, and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are way ahead of the ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, ''Repentless'' isn't quite a year old yet." King also stated that Slayer was not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=SLAYER Won't Record Follow-Up To 'Repentless' Before 2018|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/slayer-wont-record-follow-up-to-repentless-before-2018/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=December 14, 2016|access-date=August 15, 2016}}</ref> In an October interview on [[Hatebreed]] frontman [[Jamey Jasta]]'s podcast, King stated that he was "completely open" to having guitarist [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] (who had no songwriting contributions on ''Repentless'') involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, "I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that conversation. I haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's not saying it is or isn't gonna happen. But my ears are open."<ref>{{cite web|title=KERRY KING Is 'Completely Open' To Having GARY HOLT Contribute Song Ideas To Next SLAYER Album|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kerry-king-is-completely-open-to-having-gary-holt-contribute-song-ideas-to-next-slayer-album/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=October 15, 2016|access-date=February 18, 2017}}</ref>

In a June 2017 interview with the [[Ultimate Guitar Archive]], Holt said that he was ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/gary-holt-is-ready-to-write-music-for-slayer/|title=GARY HOLT Is 'Ready' To Write Music For SLAYER|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=June 15, 2017}}</ref> When speaking to ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'', King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, "Funny thing is, ''Repentless'' isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded—some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself!

We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year.

I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.{{'"}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Gary Holt: What's the Difference Between Exodus & Slayer in Songwriting Terms|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/gary_holt_whats_the_difference_between_exodus__slayer_in_songwriting_terms.html|work=[[Ultimate Guitar Archive|Ultimate-Guitar.com]]|date=October 12, 2016|access-date=October 13, 2017}}</ref>

Plans for a new album were ultimately scrapped when on January 22, 2018, Slayer announced [[Slayer Farewell Tour|their farewell world tour]] through a video featuring a montage of press clippings, early posters and press photos spanning the band's entire career. Although the members of Slayer have never publicly explained why they were retiring, it was thought that one of the reasons behind this decision was [[Tom Araya]]'s desire not to tour anymore and to spend more time with his family; Araya hinted at the possibility of retiring in a 2016 interview.<ref name="farewell tour">{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=John|title=BREAKING NEWS: Slayer Announce Farewell Tour|url=http://loudwire.com/breaking-news-slayer-announce-farewell-tour/|website=Loudwire|access-date=January 22, 2018|date=January 22, 2018}}</ref> This was confirmed by former drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] in a 2019 interview, who said: "Apparently, from what I hear. Tom has been wanting to retire when I was in the band—he wanted to stop. He had the neck issues. He's been wanting to retire for a long time now. So now that he's got it, I'm happy for him, and I hope he gets what he wants out of life and his future."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kennelty |first1=Greg |title=Dave Lombardo Says SLAYER's Tom Araya Has Wanted To Retire Since Dave Was In The Band |url=https://metalinjection.net/shocking-revelations/dave-lombardo-says-slayers-tom-araya-has-wanted-to-retire-since-dave-was-in-the-band |website=Metal Injection |date=September 19, 2019 |access-date=3 May 2021}}</ref>

The members of Slayer had expressed mixed opinions about a reunion. When asked by the ''Let There Be Talk'' podcast in June 2020 about the possibility of the band ever reforming, Holt stated, "If it does, if it ever happens, it has nothing to do with me. Someone else would call and say, 'We wanna [do this].' To my knowledge, it's done. And I think it ''should'' be that way.

But I'm going to be doing this [solo band] for the next 10 years at least." King revealed in the same interview that he has not spoken to Araya since the band's split. King also says that his relationship with Araya is positive, but his relationship with that of former drummer Dave Lombardo is estranged, stating that Lombardo "was listening to this woman that was his attorney at the time, and she thought we had Metallica money, which we've never had fucking Metallica money. So she's just blowing shit in his ear, and he thinks he should be getting more than he should be getting."<ref name="rollingstone.com"/>

===Reunion (2024–present)===

In an interview with ''[[Metal Hammer]]'', King indicated that the planned shows were a one-off and that the reunion was "not going to translate into recording and it's not going to translate into touring", clarifying that "it's three shows marking five years since our final shows, a fun, 'Hey, remember us from before the [[COVID-19 pandemic|pandemic]]?' celebration."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=June 2024 |title=Return of the King |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] }}</ref> In a May 2024 interview on ''Trunk Nation with Eddie Trunk'', King said that while he would not rule out more Slayer shows in the future, his solo career is his main priority now.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/kerry-king-slayer-is-not-gonna-make-another-record-or-tour-again | title=Kerry King: 'Slayer is Not Gonna Make Another Record' or 'Tour Again' | date=May 16, 2024 }}</ref> When asked in an October 2024 interview with [[KSAN (FM)|107.7 The Bone]] if more reunion shows were in the works, Bostaph said, "We played our last one… If everybody's asking that question, I am too, but I don't have the answer to that question.

When asked in July 2025 about the possibility of more shows under the Slayer name, Holt said: "I think it's a year-by-year thing, every year, and this is the second year we've done; it might be the last, you know? Fortunately, none of these shows have interfered with or conflicted with my Exodus schedule, so we'll see what happens. But it's been fun, playing with fire is always a blast. And last year, the shows we did, we were really good. We fucking rehearsed really hard, and we did not suck. And everybody had a great time. Everybody was happy. And so, you know, [we'll] see how it goes this year, and maybe next year, a couple other festivals." Holt also said that Slayer "is not like a permanent commitment on [his] end anymore", and added, "I'm able to focus on family number one, which is Exodus. [They're] my childhood friends.

When writing material, the band would write the music first before incorporating lyrics. King or Hanneman used a [[Multitrack recording|24-track]] and [[drum machine]] to show band members the riff that they created and get their opinion. King, Hanneman or Lombardo would mention if any alterations could be made. The band would then add parts to get the basic song structure before figuring out where the lyrics and solos would be placed.<ref name="autogenerated3" />
