Petty grew up in the [[Northeast Gainesville Residential District]], known locally as the Duckpond. After his death, a historical marker was placed in the neighborhood and a nearby park was renamed to Tom Petty Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oakmontfl.com/a-living-history-lesson-gainesvilles-duckpond-neighborhood/|title=A Living History Lesson: Gainesville's Duckpond Neighborhood|date=December 24, 2019|access-date=April 13, 2023|archive-date=April 13, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230413105006/https://oakmontfl.com/a-living-history-lesson-gainesvilles-duckpond-neighborhood/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Career==
Petty's interest in [[rock and roll]] music began at age ten when he had an opportunity to meet [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="esquire">{{cite web|last=Sager|first=Mike|title=What I've Learned: Tom Petty|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/ESQ0806WIL_134|work=Esquire|date=June 30, 2006|access-date=April 12, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327044004/http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/ESQ0806WIL_134|archive-date=March 27, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> In the summer of 1961, his uncle was working on the set of Presley's film ''[[Follow That Dream]]'', in nearby [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], and invited Petty to watch the movie's filming.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dean |first=Bill |title=Tom Petty's Life Changed When He Met Elvis |url=http://www.gainesville.com/news/20070816/young-tom-pettys-life-changed-when-he-met-elvis |work=Gainesville Sun |date=August 16, 2007 |access-date=April 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009194820/http://www.gainesville.com/news/20070816/young-tom-pettys-life-changed-when-he-met-elvis |archive-date=October 9, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Petty instantly became a Presley fan.

As a young man, Petty worked briefly on the grounds crew of the [[University of Florida]], but never attended as a student. An [[Ogeechee lime tree]] that he purportedly planted while employed at the university is now called the Tom Petty tree, though Petty said he did not recall planting any trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.president.ufl.edu/speeches/2006/09/campusCommunityCouncil.html |title=September 13, 2006 Speech to Campus Community Council |access-date=September 10, 2008 |first=Bernie |last=Machen |date=September 6, 2006 |publisher=University of Florida Office of the President |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906093854/http://president.ufl.edu/speeches/2006/09/campusCommunityCouncil.html |archive-date=September 6, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tom Petty Gets Key to Gainesville, Fla. |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Sep22/0,4670,PeopleTomPetty,00.html |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=November 22, 2006 |access-date=April 15, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406202958/http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Sep22/0%2C4670%2CPeopleTomPetty%2C00.html |archive-date=April 6, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=hollywood /> He also worked briefly as a gravedigger.<ref name=hollywood/>

===1976–1987: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers===
{{main|Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers}}
[[File:Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers 1977.jpg|thumb|Petty (center) with the Heartbreakers in 1977]]
Shortly after embracing his musical aspirations, Petty started a band known as the Epics, which later evolved into [[Mudcrutch]]. The band included future Heartbreakers [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] and [[Benmont Tench]] and was popular in Gainesville, but their recordings went unnoticed by a mainstream audience. They recorded at [[The Church Studio]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. Their only single, "Depot Street", released in 1975 by [[Shelter Records]], failed to chart.<ref name="mudcrutch1">{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Rudi|title=Tom Petty Turned Back the Clock with Mudcrutch at the 9:30 Club in D.C. on June 6|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2016/06/07/tom-petty-turned-back-the-clock-with-mudcrutch-at-the-930-club-in-d-c-on-june-6|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=October 3, 2017|date=June 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004040807/https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2016/06/07/tom-petty-turned-back-the-clock-with-mudcrutch-at-the-930-club-in-d-c-on-june-6/|archive-date=October 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

After Mudcrutch split up, Petty reluctantly agreed to pursue a solo career. Tench decided to form his own group, whose sound Petty appreciated. Eventually, Petty and Campbell collaborated with Tench, [[Ron Blair]] and [[Stan Lynch]], forming the first lineup of the Heartbreakers. Their [[Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers (album)|eponymous debut album]] gained little popularity among American audiences, achieving greater success in Britain{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}. The singles "[[American Girl (Tom Petty song)|American Girl]]" and "[[Breakdown (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)|Breakdown]]" (re-released in 1977) peaked at {{Numero|40}} after the band toured in the United Kingdom in support of [[Nils Lofgren]]. The debut album was released by Shelter Records, which at that time was distributed by [[ABC Records]].<ref name="all music">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Tom Petty: Biography|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p5137/biography|website=AllMusic|year=2006|access-date=April 12, 2008|archive-date=October 18, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221018133527/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tom-petty-mn0000612716|url-status=live}}</ref>

Their second album, ''[[You're Gonna Get It!]]'', was the band's first [[Top 40]] album,<ref name="all music" /> featuring the singles "[[I Need to Know (Tom Petty song)|I Need to Know]]" and "[[Listen to Her Heart]]". Their third album, ''[[Damn the Torpedoes (album)|Damn the Torpedoes]]'', quickly went [[RIAA certification|platinum]], selling nearly two million copies; it includes their breakthrough singles "[[Don't Do Me Like That]]", "[[Here Comes My Girl]]", "[[Even the Losers]]" and "[[Refugee (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)|Refugee]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: History of the Band|url=http://www.mudcrutch.com/index.php?pageid=heartbreakers_history|work=Mudcrutch Farm|access-date=April 12, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415150228/http://www.mudcrutch.com/index.php?pageid=heartbreakers_history|archive-date=April 15, 2008}}</ref>

Their fourth album, ''[[Hard Promises]]'', released in 1981, became a top-ten hit, going platinum and spawning the hit single "[[The Waiting (song)|The Waiting]]". The album also featured Petty's first duet, "Insider" with [[Stevie Nicks]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Beviglia|first1=Jim|title=Behind The Song: Stevie Nicks with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|url=http://americansongwriter.com/2016/02/behind-the-song-stevie-nicks-with-tom-petty-and-the-heartbreakers/|website=American Songwriter|access-date=October 3, 2017|date=February 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003125217/http://americansongwriter.com/2016/02/behind-the-song-stevie-nicks-with-tom-petty-and-the-heartbreakers/|archive-date=October 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Bass player Ron Blair quit the group and was replaced on the fifth album, ''[[Long After Dark]]'' (1982), by [[Howie Epstein]]; the resulting lineup lasted until 1994. The album contained the hit "[[You Got Lucky]]".

In 1985, the band participated in [[Live Aid]], playing four songs at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]], in [[Philadelphia]] before a crowd of 89,484 people.

The band's album, ''[[Southern Accents]]'', was also released in 1985. It included the hit single "[[Don't Come Around Here No More]]", produced by [[Dave Stewart (Eurythmics)|Dave Stewart]]. The song's video featured Petty dressed as the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]], mocking and chasing Alice from the book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', then cutting and eating her as if she were a cake. The ensuing tour led to the live album ''[[Pack Up the Plantation: Live!]]'' and an invitation from [[Bob Dylan]] to join Dylan on his 60-date [[True Confessions Tour]] through Asia, Oceania, and North America.

In 1986 and 1987, they played some dates with the [[Grateful Dead]]. Also in 1987, the group released ''[[Let Me Up (I've Had Enough)]]'' which includes "[[Jammin' Me]]" which Petty wrote with Dylan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jammin' Me: Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/t2462926 |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 19, 2009 |archive-date=October 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025064205/http://www.allmusic.com/song/t2462926 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===1988–1991: Traveling Wilburys and solo career===
{{Main|Traveling Wilburys}}
In 1988, Petty, along with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Jeff Lynne]], was a founding member of the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. The band's first song, "[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]", was intended as a B-side of one of Harrison's singles, but was judged too good for that purpose and the group decided to record a full album, ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]''. A second Wilburys album, mischievously titled ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]'' and recorded without the recently deceased Orbison, followed in 1990. The album was named ''Vol. 3'' as a response to a series of bootlegged studio sessions being sold as ''Travelling Wilburys Vol. 2''. Petty incorporated Traveling Wilburys songs into his live shows, consistently playing "Handle with Care" in shows from 2003 to 2006, and for his 2008 tour adding "surprises" such as "[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]" to the set list.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|title=Tom Petty / May 31, 2008 / Auburn Hills, Mich.

In 1989, Petty released ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'', which featured hits "[[I Won't Back Down]]", "[[Free Fallin']]" and "[[Runnin' Down a Dream]]". It was nominally his first solo album, although several Heartbreakers and other well-known musicians participated: Mike Campbell co-produced the album with Petty and Jeff Lynne of [[Electric Light Orchestra]], and backing musicians included Campbell, Lynne, and fellow Wilburys Roy Orbison and George Harrison ([[Ringo Starr]] appears on drums in the video for "I Won't Back Down", but they were actually performed by Phil Jones).<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Readers' Poll: Tom Petty's 10 Best Songs|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-tom-pettys-10-best-songs-20130619/5-i-wont-back-down-0964154|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=June 19, 2013|access-date=October 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003125323/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-tom-pettys-10-best-songs-20130619/5-i-wont-back-down-0964154|archive-date=October 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Petty and the Heartbreakers reformed in 1991 and released ''[[Into the Great Wide Open]]'', which was co-produced by Lynne and included the hit singles "[[Learning to Fly (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song)|Learning To Fly]]" and "[[Into the Great Wide Open (song)|Into the Great Wide Open]]", the latter featuring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] in the music video.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Patridge|first1=Kenneth|title=Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' 'Into the Great Wide Open' at 25: Classic Track-by-Track Album Lookback|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/tom-petty-heartbreakers-into-the-great-wide-open-25-years-7423932/|magazine=Billboard|access-date=October 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014202211/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7423932/tom-petty-heartbreakers-into-the-great-wide-open-25-years|archive-date=October 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Before leaving MCA Records, Petty and the Heartbreakers got together to record, live in the studio, two new songs for a ''[[Greatest Hits (Tom Petty album)|Greatest Hits]]'' package: "[[Mary Jane's Last Dance]]" and [[Thunderclap Newman]]'s "[[Something in the Air (song)|Something in the Air]]". This was Stan Lynch's last recorded performance with the Heartbreakers. Petty commented "He left right after the session without really saying goodbye." The package went on to sell over ten million copies, therefore receiving diamond certification by the RIAA.<ref name="gpawards">{{cite web|title=Gold & Platinum – Tom Petty|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=tom+petty#search_section|publisher=RIAA|access-date=October 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008205627/https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Tom+Petty#search_section|archive-date=October 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Petty appeared in the 1997 film ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'', directed by and starring [[Kevin Costner]], as the Bridge City Mayor (from the dialogue it is implied that he is playing a [[future history]] version of himself).<ref name="forbes100217" /> In 2002, he appeared on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the episode "[[How I Spent My Strummer Vacation]]", along with [[Mick Jagger]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Elvis Costello]], and [[Brian Setzer]]. In it, Petty spoofed himself as a tutor to [[Homer Simpson]] on the art of lyric writing, composing a brief song about a drunk girl driving down the road while concerned with the state of public schools.

==Views on artistic control==
Petty was known as a staunch guardian of his [[artistic control]] and [[artistic freedom]]. In 1979, he was involved in a legal dispute when ABC Records was sold to [[MCA Records]]. He refused to be transferred to another record label without his consent. In May 1979, he filed for bankruptcy and was signed to the new MCA subsidiary [[Backstreet Records]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Runnin' Down a Dream: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|first=Tom|last=Petty|year=2007|publisher=Chronicle Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/runnindowndream00tomp/page/79 79]|isbn=978-0-811-86201-1|url=https://archive.org/details/runnindowndream00tomp/page/79}}</ref>

In early 1981, the upcoming Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album, which would become ''Hard Promises'', was slated to be the next MCA release with the new list price of $9.98, following [[Steely Dan]]'s ''[[Gaucho (album)|Gaucho]]'' and the [[Olivia Newton-John]]/Electric Light Orchestra ''[[Xanadu (soundtrack)|Xanadu]]'' soundtrack. This so-called "[[superstar pricing]]" was $1.00 more than the usual list price of $8.98.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |title=Petty Battling MCA Over Record Price Hike |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 1, 1981 |page=N72}}</ref> Petty voiced his objections to the price hike in the press and the issue became a popular cause among music fans. Non-delivery of the album and naming it ''Eight Ninety-Eight'' were considered, but eventually MCA decided against the price increase.<ref>{{cite news |last=Marsh |first=Dave |title=Tom Petty |work=Musician |date=July 1981 |page=43}}</ref>

In 1987, Petty sued tire company [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich]] for $1&nbsp;million for using a song very similar to his song "Mary's New Car" in a TV commercial. The ad agency that produced the commercial had previously sought permission to use Petty's song but was refused.<ref>{{cite web |last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-03-08-ca-13300-story.html |title=B.F.

Some outlets have claimed that the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] single "[[Dani California]]", released in May 2006, bears a close musical similarity to Petty's "Mary Jane's Last Dance".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wgmd.com/newspost/fullnews.php?id=1142 |title=WGMD |publisher=[[WGMD]] |date=September 8, 2006 |access-date=January 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825150814/http://www.wgmd.com/newspost/fullnews.php?id=1142 |archive-date=August 25, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/31/104324.php |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers Accused of Plagiarism |date=May 31, 2006 |work=BC Magazine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613063323/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/05/31/104324.php |archive-date=June 13, 2006}}</ref> Petty told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "I seriously doubt that there is any negative intent there. And a lot of rock 'n' roll songs sound alike. Ask [[Chuck Berry]].

If someone took my song note for note and stole it maliciously, then maybe <nowiki>[I'd sue]</nowiki>. But I don't believe in lawsuits much.

In January 2015, it was revealed that Petty and Jeff Lynne would receive royalties from [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]'s song "[[Stay with Me (Sam Smith song)|Stay with Me]]" after its writers acknowledged similarities between it and "I Won't Back Down". Petty and co-composer Lynne were each awarded 12.5% of the royalties from "Stay with Me", and their names were added to the [[ASCAP]] song credit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequence.net/2015/01/tom-petty-awarded-songwriting-royalties-for-sam-smiths-stay-with-me/|title=Update: Tom Petty awarded songwriting royalties for Sam Smith's "Stay With Me"|work=Consequence of Sound|date=January 29, 2015|access-date=August 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218235728/https://consequence.net/2015/01/tom-petty-awarded-songwriting-royalties-for-sam-smiths-stay-with-me/|archive-date=December 18, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him, saying, "All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen.

==Personal life==
Petty overcame a difficult relationship with his father.   He said his father found it difficult to accept that Petty was "a mild-mannered kid who was interested in the arts"  and subjected him to verbal and physical abuse on a regular basis. Petty described his father as a "wild, gambling drinker guy".<ref name="Zollo 2005">{{cite book |last=Zollo |first=Paul |url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00zoll/page/8 |title=Conversations with Tom Petty |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=2005 |isbn=1-84449-815-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00zoll/page/8 8–15]}}</ref> He was close to his mother and his brother, Bruce.<ref>DeYoung, Bill.
