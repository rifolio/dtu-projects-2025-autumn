'''ZZ Top'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ˌ|z|iː|z|iː|_|ˈ|t|ɒ|p}} {{Respell|ZEE-zee TOP}}}} is an American rock band formed in [[Houston]], Texas, in 1969. For 51 years, it consisted of vocalist-guitarist [[Billy Gibbons]], drummer [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]], and bassist-vocalist [[Dusty Hill]] until his death in 2021. ZZ Top developed a signature sound based on Gibbons' [[blues]] style and Hill and Beard's [[rhythm section]]. They are known for their live performances, sly and humorous lyrics, and the matching appearances of Gibbons and Hill, who wore sunglasses, hats, and long beards.

ZZ Top formed after Gibbons' band, [[Moving Sidewalks]], disbanded in 1969. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' in 1971. Albums ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and ''[[Fandango!]]'' (1975), and singles "[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]" and "[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]", gained extensive radio [[airplay]]. By the mid-1970s, ZZ Top had become renowned in North America for their live act, including the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] (1976–77), which was a critical and commercial success. ZZ Top returned in 1979 with a new musical direction and image, with Gibbons and Hill wearing sunglasses and matching chest-length beards. With the album ''[[El Loco]]'' (1981), they began to experiment with [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. They established a more mainstream sound and rose to international stardom with ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]]. The popularity of the albums' music videos, including for "[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]", "[[Sharp Dressed Man]]", and "[[Legs (song)|Legs]]", gave them mass exposure on [[MTV]] and made them prominent in 1980s [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. The Afterburner tour set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing of 1986.

After the release of their 10th album, ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990), and its [[Recycler Tour|accompanying tour]], the group's experimentation continued with mixed success on the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003). They released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin' 50'' (2019), a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary. In 2018 the band won the [[Guinness world record]] for the longest-running active group with no lineup changes. On July 28 2021, ZZ Top announced that Hill had died at his home in Houston at the age of 72. In line with Hill's wishes, he was replaced by their longtime [[guitar tech]], Elwood Francis.

ZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million records.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |work= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |access-date= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |access-date= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, the members were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==History==

=== Formation ===
Billy Gibbons had formed the band [[Moving Sidewalks]] in Houston in 1966 with Dan Mitchell on drums, Tom Moore on keyboards, and Don Summers on bass. The group earned Gibbons local recognition, with their single "99th Floor" becoming a local hit. After opening for various popular groups such as [[the Doors]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and the [[13th Floor Elevators]], Moving Sidewalks eventually released the album [[Flash (Moving Sidewalks album)|''Flash'']] (1969). By this point, both Moore and Summers had been drafted into the [[United States Army]] to fight in the [[Vietnam War]], and Gibbons and Mitchell subsequently recruited bassist-keyboardist Lanier Greig, thus forming the first iteration of ZZ Top.<ref name="HC">{{cite news |last=Dansby |first=Andrew |date=February 16, 2013 |title=Greig, early ZZ Top member, dies at 64 |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Lanier-Greig-musician-and-early-ZZ-Top-member-4284956.php |access-date=July 28, 2014 |newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]}}</ref> The name of the band was Gibbons' idea; the band had a small apartment covered with concert posters, and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill]], and thought of combining the two into "ZZ King", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that "king is at the top" which gave him the idea of naming the band "ZZ Top".<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson – The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |access-date= September 13, 2015 |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |archive-date= October 7, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151007205644/https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15}}</ref>
===Early years (1969–1972)===
ZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, "Salt Lick", in 1969, and the B-side contained the song "Miller's Farm". Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Shortly after the recording of "Salt Lick", Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]'s, and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]].

Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement in late 1969. At this moment, all three members of the band were 20 years old. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at a Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970. The show was booked by [[KLVI]] radio personality Al Caldwell, who was also instrumental in broadcasting the band's first recordings.<ref>{{cite web|first=Craig |last=Hlavaty |title=ZZ Top played its first show together 50 years ago |website=houstonchronicle.com |date=February 10, 2020 |access-date=May 25, 2022 |url=https://preview.houstonchronicle.com/music/zz-top-first-concert-1970-6073072}}</ref>

In addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released. It featured "barrelhouse" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single, "[[Francine (song)|Francine]]".<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |access-date= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>

===First decade of success and signature sound (1973–1982)===

ZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973, which reached the number eight on the ''[[Billboard 200|Billboard ''200'']]'' albums chart by early 1974. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' "growling" guitar tone. Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the album "brought ZZ Top their first top-10 record, making them stars in the process".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Woodstra |first1=Chris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ2bT1mu97kC&dq=Stephen+Thomas+Erlewine+brought+ZZ+Top+their+first+Top+Ten+record,+making+them+stars+in+the+process&pg=PA256 |title=All Music Guide Required Listening: Classic Rock |last2=Bush |first2=John |last3=Erlewine |first3=Stephen Thomas |date=2007 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=978-0-87930-917-6 |pages=256 |language=en}}</ref> The album included the boogie-driven "[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious [[brothel]] in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. During this tour, ZZ Top recorded the live tracks that would fill one side of their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', which also contained one side of new studio songs. The album charted highly and its single "[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

ZZ Top began the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] in May 1976 to support ''Fandango!'', and the tour continued through 1977 with 98 shows over 18 months.<ref>{{cite web|title=Live Rattlesnakes and Rock n' Roll: The Story of ZZ Top's "Worldwide Texas Tour" |last=Moreno |first=Ricky |website=stmuscholars.com |date=October 22, 2020 |access-date=May 25, 2022 |url=https://stmuscholars.org/live-rattlesnakes-and-rock-n-roll-the-story-of-zz-tops-worldwide-texas-tour/}}</ref> ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', recorded during a break in the tour and released in November 1976, was the final ZZ Top album under their contract with London Records. It was not as successful or as positively received as their previous two efforts, but reached number 17 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite web|title= Tejas – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= July 28, 2014 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/tejas-mw0000193395/awards}}</ref> The singles from ''Tejas'', "[[It's Only Love (ZZ Top song)|It's Only Love]]" and "[[Arrested for Driving While Blind]]", both failed to crack the top 40 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

In 1978, after almost seven years of touring and a string of successful albums, ZZ Top went on hiatus while Beard dealt with addiction problems. Gibbons traveled to Europe, Beard went to Jamaica, and Hill went to Mexico.<ref name="DiPerna">{{cite magazine |last=di Perna |first=Alan |date=July 2, 2008 |title=ZZ Top: Cars, Guitars, & Three Unlikely Rock Stars |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/zz_top_cars_guitars_three_unlikely_rock_stars?page=0,8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030192921/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/zz_top_cars_guitars_three_unlikely_rock_stars?page=0,8 |archive-date=October 30, 2008 |magazine=[[Guitar World]]}}</ref> Hill also spent three months working at [[Dallas Fort Worth International Airport|DFW Airport]], saying he wanted to "feel normal" and "ground himself" after years spent performing.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Lifton |first=Dave |date=August 31, 2019 |title=Why Dusty Hill Spent ZZ Top's '70s Hiatus Working at an Airport |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/dusty-hill-day-job/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210730230222/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/dusty-hill-day-job/ |archive-date=July 30, 2021 |access-date=2021-07-30 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |language=en}}</ref> In 1979, ZZ Top returned to record a new album. Gibbons and Hill were now sporting chest-length beards. ZZ Top signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and released the album ''[[Degüello]]'' in late 1979.

While ''Degüello'' went platinum, it only reached number 24 on the ''Billboard'' chart.<ref>{{cite web|title= Degüello – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= July 28, 2014 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/deg%C3%BCello-mw0000651021/awards}}</ref> The album produced two popular singles: "[[I Thank You (song)|I Thank You]]", a cover of the [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]]/[[Isaac Hayes]] composition originally recorded by [[Sam & Dave]], and the band original "[[Cheap Sunglasses]]".

=== ''Eliminator'' (1983) ===
[[File:ZZTop.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|Hill and Gibbons in 1983]]

Gibbons pushed ZZ Top in a more modern direction for ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'', released in March 1983. It featured two top-40 singles ("[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]" and "[[Legs (song)|Legs]]"), and two additional [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Top Rock]] hits ("[[Got Me Under Pressure]]" and "[[Sharp Dressed Man]]"), with the extended dance mix of "Legs" peaking at number 13 on the [[Dance Club Songs|Club Play Singles]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|title= Eliminator – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= July 28, 2013 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/eliminator-mw0000192586/awards}}</ref> The album became a critical and commercial success, selling more than 10 million copies and reaching number 9 in the U.S. ''Billboard'' pop charts. It is the only ZZ Top album to be [[certified diamond]].<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|title= Gold & Platinum – ZZ Top |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date= August 22, 2021 |url= https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=zz+top&adv=SEARCH#search_section}}</ref>

Several music videos from the album were in regular rotation on MTV, attracting many new fans. The band won their first [[MTV Video Music Award]]s in the categories of [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Group Video|Best Group Video]] for "Legs", and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] for "Sharp Dressed Man". The music videos were included in their ''[[Greatest Hits (ZZ Top DVD)|Greatest Hits]]'' video, which was later released on DVD and quickly went multiplatinum.<ref name="riaa"/>

''Eliminator'' retained Gibbons's signature guitar style, while adding elements of [[new wave music]]; the electronic band [[Depeche Mode]] was cited as an influence.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= David |last= Fricke |author-link= David Fricke |title= Billy Gibbons: My Life in 15 Songs |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= November 10, 2015 |access-date= November 1, 2020 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/billy-gibbons-my-life-in-15-songs-151784/sharp-dressed-man-1983-142974/}}</ref> To compose the songs, Gibbons worked closely with live-in engineer Linden Hudson at the band's rehearsal studio in Texas, setting a faster [[tempo]] with [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.

Stage manager David Blayney described how Hudson co-wrote much of the material on the album without receiving credit. The band recorded Hudson's song "Thug" without permission, finally paying him $600,000 in 1986 after he proved in court he held the copyright.<ref name="Blayney1994">{{cite book|first= David |last= Blayney |year= 1994 |title= Sharp Dressed Men |location= New York |publisher= [[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |pages= 196–203 |isbn= 0-7868-8005-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Deborah |last=Frost |year= 1985 |title= ZZ Top - Bad and Worldwide |pages=103, 106–107, 115 |location= New York |publisher= Rolling Stone Press |isbn= 0020029500}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Sinclair |year= 1986 |title= Tres Hombres: The Story of ZZ Top |page=76 |publisher= [[Virgin Books|Virgin]] |isbn= 0-86369-167-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|author= Staff |date= March 1987 |title= Who Writes the Songs? |magazine= [[Texas Monthly]] |volume= 15 |issue= 3 |page= 82 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6CkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82}}</ref> The band had previously used other people's work without credit; for instance, in 1972 ZZ Top claimed sole writing credit for the hit song "[[Francine (song)|Francine]]" from the album ''Rio Grande Mud'', cutting out two co-writers, Steve Perron and [[Kenny Cordray]].

=== ''Afterburner'' and ''Recycler'' (1985–1991) ===
Despite selling fewer copies than ''Eliminator'', ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985) became ZZ Top's highest-charting album (number four on the U.S. ''Billboard'' chart),<ref name="Afterburner">{{cite web|title= Afterburner – Awards |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= July 28, 2013 |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/afterburner-mw0000196478/awards}}</ref> with sales of five million copies.<ref name="riaa"/> All of the singles from ''Afterburner'' were top-40 hits, with "Sleeping Bag" and "Stages" topping the Mainstream Rock chart.<ref name="Afterburner"/> The music video for "[[Velcro Fly]]", their final top-40 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, was choreographed by future pop singer [[Paula Abdul]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Paula Abdul – Times Topics |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= August 5, 2009 |access-date= December 19, 2010 |url= http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/paula_abdul/index.html}}</ref> In 1987, ZZ Top released ''[[The Six Pack (ZZ Top album)|The Six Pack]]'', a collection of their first five albums plus ''El Loco''. The albums were remixed with new drum and guitar effects for a more "contemporary" sound similar to ''Eliminator''.<ref>{{cite web|first= Stephen Thomas |last= Erlewine |title= ZZ Top – Six Pack |website= [[AllMusic]] |access-date= August 22, 2021 |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/six-pack-mw0000651365}}</ref>

''[[Recycler (ZZ Top album)|Recycler]]'', released in 1990, was ZZ Top's final studio album with Warner Records and the last of a distinct sonic trilogy in their catalogue, marking a return towards a simpler guitar-driven blues sound with less synthesizer and pop bounce than their previous two albums. This move did not entirely suit the fan base that ''Eliminator'' and ''Afterburner'' had built up, and while ''Recycler'' did achieve platinum status, it never matched the sales of those albums. However, the single "[[My Head's in Mississippi]]" reached number one on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks]] chart that year.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Mainstream Rock: Dec 08, 1990 |magazine= Billboard |date= November 28, 2013 |access-date= July 21, 2019 |url= http://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/1990-12-08/hot-mainstream-rock-tracks}}</ref>

===Return to guitar-driven sound (1992–2003)===
In 1992, Warner released ''ZZ Top's Greatest Hits'', along with a new [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]]-style cut, "Gun Love", and an [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]-inflected video, "[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]". In 1993, ZZ Top inducted a major influence, [[Cream (band)|Cream]], into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

In 1994, the band signed a $35 million deal with [[RCA Records]],<ref name="rockhonors">{{cite web|title= VH1 Rock Honors 2007 – Honorees |publisher= [[VH1]] |year= 2007 |access-date= December 19, 2010 |url= http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/rock_honors/_2007/honorees.jhtml |archive-date= July 3, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120703065056/http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/rock_honors/_2007/honorees.jhtml}}</ref> releasing the million-selling ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]''. Subsequent RCA albums, ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996) and 1999's ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (the second album to feature live tracks) sold well, but did not reach the levels enjoyed previously. In 2003, ZZ Top released a final RCA album, ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'', an album thick with harsh Gibbons guitar and featuring a [[hidden track]]—a cover version of "[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By.]]" RCA impresario Clive Davis wanted to do a collaboration record (in the mode of [[Carlos Santana]]'s successful ''Supernatural'') for this album. In an interview in ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]'', Davis stated that artists [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Dave Matthews]], and [[Wilco]] were among the artists slated for the project. ZZ Top performed "Tush" and "Legs" as part of the [[Super Bowl XXXI halftime show]] in 1997.

A comprehensive four-CD collection of recordings from the London and Warner Bros. years, ''[[Chrome, Smoke & BBQ]]'', was released in 2003. It featured the band's first single (A- and B-side) and several rare B-side tracks, as well as a radio promotion from 1979, a live track, and several extended dance-mix versions of their biggest MTV hits. Three tracks from Billy Gibbons' pre-ZZ band, the Moving Sidewalks, were also included.

== Drug use ==
Beard struggled with addiction in the 1970s, claiming to have spent "every bit" of his money earned from ZZ Top's tours on drugs. Beard explains that he had different reasons for taking different drugs, saying "the pills thing came about just from the workload. And the [[heroin]] thing came about because I just liked it. I mean, you ever done heroin? It's great. It's a fucking vacation for the mind, and I liked it. I liked it a lot." Beard entered rehabilitation in the 1980s and was sober as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kielty |first=Martin|title=ZZ Top's Frank Beard Details '70s Heroin Addiction: 'A Regret' |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-frank-beard-heroin/ |access-date=2023-01-16 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=February 26, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

Hill would "[occasionally] partake" in [[marijuana]] until one occasion in a hotel in [[Amsterdam]], when Hill was smoking marijuana with guitar tech Elwood Francis and Francis noticed that a metal bar was embedded into the window frame of the hotel room. Francis, seeing an opportunity for a prank, jumped out the window and (unbeknownst to Hill) grabbed onto the metal bar, making it appear that he had committed suicide. Hill apparently never smoked marijuana again after the incident.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Elwood Francis on Instagram: "So I'm in Dusty's room on the third floor of a hotel in Amsterdam. It's early summer, fantastic weather outside and the windows were open. Dust didn't smoke weed but on occasion in Amsterdam, he would partake. This was one of those occasions. It was only Dusty, the TM, and myself armed with a single joint. We slowly puffed a drag or two each and we're probably talking about Andy Griffith or something similar... just casual conversation. I walked over to the window and while looking out noticed this metal bar embedded in the concrete as part of the window frame. It was extended outside the window just below the bottom of the frame. I pulled around on the bar and checked its stability, then sat back down. After I passed the joint to Dusty on the next round, I got up and jumped out the window. They can't see that I had grabbed the rail with my hand as I was passing over it and was just hanging there like I would on monkey bars. Dusty and Pablo freaked out and jumped up not knowing what the heck to do. They ran over to the window expecting to see me splattered on the sidewalk, but found me hanging there, laughing. They both just remained confused about what happened while I popped back inside. Dusty didn't smoke weed anymore after that. Nor did he let me around any open windows. One of me best pranks, it was." |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CR5VMiDs4TM/ |access-date=2023-01-16 |website=Instagram |language=en}}</ref>
