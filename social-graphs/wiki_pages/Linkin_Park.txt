'''Linkin Park''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Agoura Hills, California]], in 1996. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist [[Mike Shinoda]], lead guitarist [[Brad Delson]], DJ/turntablist [[Joe Hahn]], bassist [[Dave Farrell]], vocalist [[Emily Armstrong]], and drummer [[Colin Brittain]]. The lineup for the band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist [[Chester Bennington]] and drummer [[Rob Bourdon]]; after Bennington's death in July 2017, the band endured a seven-year hiatus, during which Bourdon chose to depart from the band. In September 2024, Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.

Categorized mainly as [[alternative rock]] and [[nu metal]], Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], with their later music featuring more [[electronica]] and [[Pop music|pop]] elements. Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, ''[[Hybrid Theory]]'' (2000), which became certified [[RIAA certification#List of certifications|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on [[MTV]] led to the singles "[[One Step Closer (Linkin Park song)|One Step Closer]]", "[[Crawling (song)|Crawling]]", and "[[In the End]]" all charting highly on the US [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart.

==History==

===1996–2000: Foundation and early years===
Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: [[Mike Shinoda]], [[Rob Bourdon]], and [[Brad Delson]].<ref name=Ask-Bio>{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Hosken|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/men/entertainment_150/196_linkin_park.html|title=Linkin Park - AskMen|work=AskMen|access-date=February 1, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101160030/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/men/entertainment_150/196_linkin_park.html|archive-date=November 1, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The three attended [[Agoura High School]] in [[Agoura Hills, California]], a suburb of Los Angeles.<ref name=Ask-Bio/> After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting [[Joe Hahn]], [[Dave Farrell|Dave "Phoenix" Farrell]], and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo album, entitled ''Xero'', released in November 1997.<ref name=Ask-Bio/> That same month, the band performed their first show, [[Opening act|opening]] for [[SX-10]] and [[System of a Down]] at the [[Whisky a Go Go]], a nightclub in [[West Hollywood]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blue|first=Jeff|author-link=Jeff Blue|date=2020|title=One Step Closer (From Xero to #1 : Becoming Linkin Park)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFMEEAAAQBAJ|location=|publisher=Permuted Press|page=|chapter=Chapter 4: First Sip of Whiskey|isbn=9781682619681}}</ref> Delson introduced the band to [[Jeff Blue]], the vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] for [[Zomba Group of Companies|Zomba Music]], whom he had interned for in college.<ref name="jeff1">{{cite web|first=Ashley|last=Perez Hollingsworth|url=https://genreisdead.com/jeff-blue-linkin-park-interview/|title=Interview: Jeff Blue Reflects On The Struggles, Frustrations, And Joys Of Working With Linkin Park|work=Genre Is Dead|date=February 16, 2021|access-date=February 1, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230329075951/https://genreisdead.com/jeff-blue-linkin-park-interview/|archive-date=March 29, 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> Blue offered the band constructive criticism to catch the attention of record labels.

The vocal interplay between Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda played as a major part within Linkin Park's music, with Bennington being the lead vocalist and Shinoda as the [[rapping]] vocalist. On Linkin Park's third album, ''Minutes to Midnight'', Shinoda sings lead vocals on "In Between", "Hands Held High", and on the B-side "No Roads Left". On numerous songs from the band's fourth album, ''[[A Thousand Suns]]'', such as the album's singles ("[[The Catalyst]]", "[[Burning in the Skies]]", "[[Iridescent (song)|Iridescent]]"), both Shinoda and Bennington sing. The album has been regarded as a turning point in the band's musical career, having a stronger emphasis on electronica.<ref name="reflectionsofdarkness1">{{cite web|url=http://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-k-o-cdreviews-133/8220-linkin-park-a-thousand-suns.html|title=Linkin Park – A Thousand Suns|publisher=Reflectionsofdarkness.com|date=September 17, 2010|access-date=January 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619232916/http://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-k-o-cdreviews-133/8220-linkin-park-a-thousand-suns.html|archive-date=June 19, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="killyourstereo1">{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/reviews/488/linkin-park-a-thousand-suns/|title=Linkin Park – A Thousand Suns|work=Kill Your Stereo|date=September 14, 2010|access-date=January 22, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330165623/http://www.killyourstereo.com/reviews/488/linkin-park-a-thousand-suns/|archive-date=March 30, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> James Montgomery, of MTV, compared the record to [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]'',<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Montgomery|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646930/20100831/linkin_park.jhtml|title=Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns: Kid A, All Grown Up?|work=[[MTV]]|date=September 6, 2010|access-date=September 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903171649/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646930/20100831/linkin_park.jhtml|archive-date=September 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> while Jordy Kasko of ''Review, Rinse, Repeat'' likened the album to both ''Kid A'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s landmark album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.<ref name="Jordy Kasko">{{cite web|first=Jordy|last=Kasko|url=http://www.reviewrinserepeat.com/artist/linkin-park/album/a-thousand-suns/review|title=Linkin Park – A Thousand Suns|work=Review Rinse Repeat|date=September 10, 2010|access-date=September 11, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001222817/http://www.reviewrinserepeat.com/artist/linkin-park/album/a-thousand-suns/review|archive-date=October 1, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Shinoda stated that he and the other band members were deeply influenced by [[Chuck D]] and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]].
