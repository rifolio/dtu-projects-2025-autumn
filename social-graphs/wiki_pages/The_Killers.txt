'''The Killers''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, in 2001 by [[Brandon Flowers]] (lead vocals, keyboards, bass) and [[Dave Keuning]] (lead guitar, backing vocals). After the band went through a number of short-term bassists and drummers, [[Mark Stoermer]] (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and [[Ronnie Vannucci Jr.]] (drums, percussion) joined in 2002.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Killers|journal=Billboard: The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment}}</ref>

The Killers have released seven studio albums, each of which topped the [[UK Albums Chart]]: ''[[Hot Fuss]]'' (2004), ''[[Sam's Town]]'' (2006), ''[[Day & Age]]'' (2008), ''[[Battle Born (album)|Battle Born]]'' (2012), ''[[Wonderful Wonderful (The Killers album)|Wonderful Wonderful]]'' (2017), ''[[Imploding the Mirage]]'' (2020), and ''[[Pressure Machine]]'' (2021). They have also released a B-sides and rarities [[compilation album|compilation]], ''[[Sawdust (album)|Sawdust]]'' (2007); a live album, ''[[Live from the Royal Albert Hall]]'' (2009); two [[Greatest hits album|greatest-hits albums]], ''[[Direct Hits (The Killers album)|Direct Hits]]'' (2013) and ''[[Rebel Diamonds]]'' (2023); and a Christmas compilation, ''[[Don't Waste Your Wishes]]'' (2016).

Since 2016 and 2017, respectively, Stoermer and Keuning have had extended hiatuses from the band. Stoermer mostly retired from touring, citing both exhaustion and lingering effects from a pyrotechnics accident, while Keuning released a solo album. Despite his hiatus from touring, Stoermer participated in recording sessions for ''Wonderful Wonderful'' and ''Imploding the Mirage'', and it was announced that Keuning was participating in recording ''Pressure Machine'', which was released in 2021. [[Ted Sablay]], who had served as a touring keyboardist and rhythm guitarist for the band since 2006, assumed lead guitar duties for live shows in Keuning's absence, while touring rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jake Blanton assumed the role of bassist in live shows. With Sablay moving to lead guitar, the band hired Taylor Milne and Robbie Connolly to play rhythm guitar and keyboards, respectively, live.

===2001–2003: Origins and formation===
In 2001, [[Brandon Flowers]] was fired by his first band, a [[synth-pop]] trio called Blush Response.<ref name=lvw140405>{{cite news |last=Sculley |first=Alan |title=Brandon Flowers Speaks |url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/archive/2005/apr/14/noise-brandon-flowers-speaks/ |access-date=March 15, 2013 |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Weekly]] |date=April 14, 2005 |archive-date=October 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215347/http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/archive/2005/apr/14/noise-brandon-flowers-speaks/ |url-status=live }}</ref> After attending an [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] concert at the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel]] during [[The Tour of Brotherly Love]], Flowers realized his calling was to be in a rock band and began searching for like-minded musicians.<ref name=paste010605>{{cite news|last=Lanham|first=Tom|title=Oasis – Brit-Rock 'n' Role Models|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2005/06/oasis.html|access-date=March 16, 2013|newspaper=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=June 1, 2005|archive-date=October 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010231137/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2005/06/oasis.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He eventually came across an ad posted in a Las Vegas newspaper by [[Dave Keuning]], a 25-year-old guitarist who had moved to Las Vegas from [[Iowa]] a year earlier. When the pair met, they bonded over similar musical influences and began writing songs together in Keuning's apartment. They named their band the Killers because that was the name of a fictional band in the video for the [[New Order (band)|New Order]] song "[[Crystal (New Order song)|Crystal]]".<ref name=men200413>{{cite news|last=Bourne|first=Dianne|title=Video: Bernard Sumner joins The Killers in celebration of their 'musical home'|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music/bernard-sumner-stage-manchester-arena-1332304|access-date=March 15, 2013|newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=February 20, 2013|archive-date=December 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204122320/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music/bernard-sumner-stage-manchester-arena-1332304|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Killers - The Killers Comment on Mr. Brightside (Watch This) {{!}} Vevo |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIpYS2d9gzA | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211029/rIpYS2d9gzA| archive-date=2021-10-29|website=YouTube | date=April 27, 2020 |access-date=19 July 2020}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In November 2001, they headed to Kill the Messenger Studio in Henderson, Nevada, along with recently recruited drummer Matt Norcross, to record a demo.

Ronnie Vannucci Jr. joined the Killers shortly before Neal's departure. Vannucci was well known in the Las Vegas music scene, having played in bands since he was young. He met the Killers in 2002 while he playing in other bands, including Daphne Major and Romance Fantasy. Vannucci's first show with the band was on August 30, 2002, at a club called The Junkyard.<ref>{{cite news |last=McLean |first=Craig |date=September 14, 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/14/popandrock5 |title=Change we can believe in |work=The Guardian |access-date=November 24, 2019 |archive-date=August 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809055125/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/14/popandrock5 |url-status=live }}</ref> Playing bass that night was [[Mark Stoermer]], who was at this point the lead guitarist for local [[progressive rock]] band the Negative Ponies. The band wanted Stoermer to join them permanently, but he was initially reluctant. They had first approached him to be the second guitarist when they were considering turning the band into a five-piece, "possibly more like [[the Strokes]], with a keyboard". Stoermer later said he could also play bass.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/killers-mark-stoermer-interview-are-your-stars-out-video-premiere-7454384/|title=Killers Mark Stoermer Interview|magazine=Billboard|access-date=September 22, 2017|archive-date=April 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423000808/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7454384/killers-mark-stoermer-interview-are-your-stars-out-video-premiere|url-status=live}}</ref> The band had continued as a three-piece, trying out other bassists until November 2002, when Stoermer accepted the invitation to join. According to [[Ryan Pardey]], who booked many of the band's early shows, "They became a great band when Ronnie and Mark joined. That's when they finally became a cohesive unit. What Ronnie did — he was the discipline — and Mark was just a solid musician."<ref name="Mike DJ Pizzo"/>

[[File:Killerslogo.svg|thumb|The band's logo, first used in 2003]]
While walking through a [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin Megastore]] in Las Vegas in 2002, Flowers noticed the album artwork on the then-new [[Elvis Presley]] compilation album ''[[ELV1S: 30 No. 1 Hits]]''. This inspired him to use a marquee sign motif as the band's logo. The band hired Vannucci's roommate's girlfriend to design it, and the logo has been used in the band's branding, releases, promotional materials, and merchandise ever since.<ref name=ViewsTitle>Video ''"[https://www.amazon.com/live/broadcast/8c8df2b0-2810-41de-8a54-08b9462c1353-Amazon Music Live Series with The Killers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220321090018/https://www.amazon.com/live/broadcast/8c8df2b0-2810-41de-8a54-08b9462c1353-Amazon |date=March 21, 2022 }}"'', accessed on 13 September 2020 20:26:40 [[UTC]]</ref>

The four members worked on song ideas in Vannucci's garage. They also sneaked into the band room at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (where Vannucci was studying [[classical percussion]]) at night to practice. During this period, the band wrote much of its debut album, ''[[Hot Fuss]]'', including the hit singles "[[Somebody Told Me]]" and "[[Smile Like You Mean It]]".<ref name="being signed">{{cite web |last=Kalil |first=Mike |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Sep-18-Sun-2005/living/3337781.html/beingsigned |title=In Depth: Killers Rising |publisher=Los Angeles Review Journal |date=September 18, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629145124/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Sep-18-Sun-2005/living/3337781.html/beingsigned |archive-date=June 29, 2011}}</ref> The band continued playing at small venues around Las Vegas, often playing Sunday nights at the transgender bar Sasha's (later renamed Tramps).<ref>{{cite news |last=Bychawski |first=Adam |date=July 13, 2011 |url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-killers/57985 |title=Brandon Flowers: "The Killers played transvestite bars" |work=NME |access-date=April 21, 2020 |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222121555/http://www.nme.com/news/the-killers/57985 |url-status=live }}</ref> They caught the attention of Braden Merrick, an [[A&R]] rep for [[Warner Bros.

Shortly afterwards they returned to London, having been invited to support [[British Sea Power]] on their UK tour.  The band also worked with [[Alan Moulder]] at [[Eden Studios (recording facility)|Eden Studios]] and [[Townhouse Studios]] mixing tracks for their upcoming album. They continued playing support slots during the first half of 2004, including touring both the US & UK with [[Stellastarr]] and opening for [[Morrissey]] on two occasions.

===2007–2011: ''Day & Age'' and hiatus===
[[File:Brandon Flowers singing for The Killers Day & Age World Tour.jpg|thumb|Brandon Flowers during the Day & Age World Tour]]
The band enlisted [[Stuart Price]] to produce their third studio album, he had previously remixed their songs under his ''Jacques Lu Cont'' moniker, the most notable being the remix of "Mr. Brightside". They first met Price at his London home in 2007 to discuss the possibility of him producing some unreleased tracks for their b-sides album Sawdust, however that same night they ended up in Price's home studio recording a demo of "[[Human (The Killers song)|Human]]" a new song that would become the eventual lead single from ''Day & Age''. The band took six months apart following the completion of their Sam's Town tour, during this period they would send song ideas between each other and Price via [[Logic Pro]]. The band finished recording the album with Price at the band's newly acquired [[Battle Born Studios]] in Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/in-action/thekillers/ |title=The Killers: Virtual Sessions |publisher=Apple |access-date=September 16, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114105604/https://www.apple.com/uk/logic-pro/in-action/thekillers/ |archive-date=January 14, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

"Human" was released in October 2008 with Flowers describing the song as "[[Johnny Cash]] meets the Pet Shop Boys". The song became a hit worldwide.  The lyric "Are we human, or are we dancer?" confused listeners, due to its grammar and ambiguity. Flowers explained that the line was inspired by a [[Hunter S. Thompson]] quote where he stated America was raising "a generation of dancers". It has since been voted by one poll as the most confusing song lyric of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/93140/human-by-the-killers-voted-most-baffling-lyric|title="Human" by The Killers voted 'most baffling lyric'|author=Trendell, Andrew|date=August 1, 2014|work=Gigwise|access-date=September 15, 2014|archive-date=September 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915093850/http://www.gigwise.com/news/93140/human-by-the-killers-voted-most-baffling-lyric|url-status=live}}</ref>

Flowers stated that ''Day & Age'' was "like looking at Sam's Town from Mars", the band have called it their "most playful record" with the album making use of [[saxophones]], [[steel drums]], [[harpsichord]], and tribal chanting. The album also saw the band write some of their most personal and challenging lyrics to date.  Closing track "Goodnight, Travel Well" was written about the death of Keuning's mother, while "[[A Dustland Fairytale]]" was written as a tribute to frontman Flowers' parents, his mother had recently been diagnosed with [[terminal cancer]].

In March 2022, the band released a deluxe edition of ''Pressure Machine''. The next month they kicked off their Imploding the Mirage tour with three nights at the Chelsea Ballroom in the [[Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas]]. Bassist Mark Stoermer was still absent, his part covered on tour by Jake Blanton, but Stoermer was reportedly interested in recording the band's next album, their eighth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequence.net/2022/04/the-killers-las-vegas-review/|title=The Killers Kick Off "Imploding the Mirage Tour" with Raucous Hometown Gig in Vegas: Recap + Photos|website=consequence.net|access-date=April 15, 2022|archive-date=April 17, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220417090133/https://consequence.net/2022/04/the-killers-las-vegas-review/amp/|url-status=live}}</ref>

On July 8, 2022, the band unveiled their upcoming single "Boy" during their performance at [[Mad Cool|Mad Cool Festival]] in Madrid. The song was written during the ''Pressure Machine'' recording sessions but didn't fit the album's aesthetic. During an interview with ''NME'' Flowers confirmed they have been working on their eighth album, stating there would be more single releases in 2022 leading to the album's release early 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Beaumont |first=Mark |date=2022-07-11 |title=How the live premiere of The Killers' new song 'Boy' could point to a bold future |url=https://www.nme.com/features/opinion/the-killers-boy-mad-cool-festival-premiere-3265758 |access-date=2022-07-13 |website=NME |language=en-GB |archive-date=July 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220713091958/https://www.nme.com/features/opinion/the-killers-boy-mad-cool-festival-premiere-3265758 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On August 15, 2023, the band performed at the [[Black Sea Arena]] in [[Shekvetili]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. During a performance of the song "[[For Reasons Unknown]]", the band attracted controversy as they invited a fan, who happened to be Russian, from the crowd on stage to help them perform the song. This was followed by booing by some parts of the crowd. The band's lead singer Brandon Flowers tried to defuse the tensions by saying that all Killers fans are "brothers and sisters". Some parts of the audience left in protest. The band later shared an apology on their social media, saying that they did not want to insult anyone and their message about friendship was misconstrued amid the [[Georgia–Russia relations|political tensions]] between Russia and Georgia and the [[Russian-occupied territories in Georgia|occupation]] of Georgian territories by Russia.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sun |first=Michael |date=2023-08-16 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/16/booing-and-walkouts-after-the-killers-tell-georgia-audience-russian-is-their-brother |title=Booing and walkouts after the Killers tell Georgia audience Russian is their 'brother' |access-date=2023-08-16 |website=The Guardian |language=en-GB |archive-date=August 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230816080853/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/16/booing-and-walkouts-after-the-killers-tell-georgia-audience-russian-is-their-brother |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2233261/the-killers-apologize-for-bringing-russian-fan-onstage-in-georgia-telling-crowd-theyre-all-brothers/news/ |title=The Killers Apologize For Bringing Russian Fan Onstage In Georgia, Telling Crowd They're All "Brothers" |work=Stereogum |last=Brodsky |first=Rachel |date=August 15, 2023 |access-date=August 22, 2023 |archive-date=August 22, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230822100617/https://www.stereogum.com/2233261/the-killers-apologize-for-bringing-russian-fan-onstage-in-georgia-telling-crowd-theyre-all-brothers/news/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Later that month, Flowers confirmed that the eighth album had been scrapped due to his dissatisfaction with its direction, stating "I don’t think you’ll see us making this type of music any more."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/brandon-flowers-nixes-killers-album-next-phase-1234812988/|title=Brandon Flowers Nixes New Killers LP: 'I Don't Think You'll See Us Making This Type of Music Any More'|first=Althea|last=Legaspi|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=August 27, 2023|accessdate=September 1, 2023|archive-date=September 1, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901135957/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/brandon-flowers-nixes-killers-album-next-phase-1234812988/|url-status=live}}</ref>
