The<!--- Do NOT remove "The", see the talk page ---> '''Ramones'''{{efn|The band is often referred to as '''the Ramones''', though most of the band's releases refer to them as simply "Ramones". Some compilation albums use "The Ramones".}} were an American [[punk rock]] band formed in the [[New York City]] neighborhood [[Forest Hills, Queens]] in 1974. Known for helping establish the punk movement in the United States and elsewhere, the Ramones are often recognized as one of the first bands of the genre. Although they had never achieved significant commercial success during their existence, the band is seen today as highly influential in [[Punk subculture|punk culture]].

All members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname Ramone, although none were biologically related; they were inspired by [[Paul McCartney]], who would check into hotels under the alias Paul Ramon. The Ramones performed 2,263&nbsp;concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22&nbsp;years,<ref name="HallofFame">{{cite web |date=September 15, 2004 |title=Ramones |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/ramones/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710095617/http://rockhall.com/inductees/ramones/ |archive-date=July 10, 2015 |access-date=July 9, 2015 |publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame + Museum}}</ref> and released fourteen studio albums. In 1996, after a tour as part of the [[Lollapalooza]] music festival, they played a [[We're Outta Here!|farewell concert]] in Los Angeles and disbanded.<ref name=Schinder559/>

By 2014, all four original members had died: lead singer [[Joey Ramone]] (1951–2001), bassist [[Dee Dee Ramone]] (1951–2002), guitarist [[Johnny Ramone]] (1948–2004) and drummer [[Tommy Ramone]] (1949–2014).<ref name="AP"/><ref name="nytimes"/><ref name="Sisario"/><ref name=guardian>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/12/tommy-ramone-dies-aged-65 |title=Tommy Ramone dies aged 62 |work=[[The Guardian]] |agency=Australian Associated Press |date=July 12, 2014 |access-date=July 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712075737/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/12/tommy-ramone-dies-aged-65 |archive-date=July 12, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Ramones had experienced a few lineup changes, with Joey and Johnny as the only constant members. Tommy left the band in 1978 to pursue a career in [[Record producer|record production]], and was replaced by [[Marky Ramone]], who himself was replaced by [[Richie Ramone]] in 1983. Following Richie's departure in 1987, and a brief stint with [[Clem Burke|Elvis Ramone]], Marky rejoined the band and Dee Dee departed two years later. From 1989 to their breakup in 1996, the Ramones consisted of Joey, Johnny, Marky and bassist [[C. J. Ramone]].

[[File:ForestHillsHS.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Forest Hills High School (New York)|Forest Hills High School]], attended by the four original members of the Ramones]]

The original members of the band met in and around the middle-class neighborhood of [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] in the New York City borough of [[Queens]]. [[Johnny Ramone|John Cummings]] and [[Tommy Ramone|Thomas Erdelyi]] had both been in a high-school [[Garage rock|garage band]] from 1965 to 1967 known as the Tangerine Puppets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Laitio-Ramone, Jari-Pekka|url=http://kauhajokinyt.fi/~jplaitio/story/tange.html|title=Tangerine Puppets (Interview with Richard Adler)|year=1997|publisher=Jari-Pekka Laitio-Ramonen Henkilökohtainen Kotisivutuotos|access-date=November 5, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104182247/http://kauhajokinyt.fi/~jplaitio/story/tange.html|archive-date=January 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They became friends with [[Dee Dee Ramone|Douglas Colvin]], who had recently moved to the area from Germany,<ref name=eotc>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/endofthecentury/ramones.html|title=End of the Century: The Ramones|work=Independent Lens|publisher=PBS|access-date=November 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110225615/http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/endofthecentury/ramones.html|archive-date=November 10, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Joey Ramone|Jeff Hyman]], who was the singer for the [[glam rock]] band [[Sniper (American band)|Sniper]], founded in 1972.<ref name="Time">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,107146-2,00.html|title=Pal Joey|last=Enright|first=Michael|date=April 20, 2001|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=October 20, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205234544/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,107146-2,00.html|archive-date=December 5, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>McNeil and McCain (1996), pp.&nbsp;181, 496.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://garagehangover.com/ageofreason/|title=The Age of Reason |website=Garagehangover.com|access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref>

The Ramones began taking shape in early 1974 when Cummings and Colvin invited Hyman to join them in a band. Colvin wanted to play guitar and sing, Cummings would also play guitar and Hyman would play drums. The lineup was to be completed with their friend Richie Stern on bass. However, after only a few rehearsals it became clear that Stern could not play bass, so the group parted ways with him and became a trio, with Colvin switching from guitar to bass in addition to singing while Cummings became the only guitarist.<ref name="Commando">{{cite book|last1=Ramone|first1=Johnny|author-link1=Johnny Ramone|title=Commando: The Autobiography of Johnny Ramone|date=April 2012|publisher=[[Abrams Image]]|location=New York City, New York|isbn=9780810996601|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBZlyEn5H1gC&q=richie+stern&pg=PT47|access-date=7 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208073533/https://books.google.ca/books?id=dBZlyEn5H1gC&pg=PT47&dq=richie+stern&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGmcu_3pbXAhVm34MKHWFaDi4Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=richie%20stern&f=false|archive-date=December 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Colvin was the first to adopt the name "Ramone", calling himself Dee Dee Ramone.

A friend of the band, Monte A. Melnick (later their tour manager), helped to arrange rehearsal time for them at Manhattan's Performance Studios, where he worked. Johnny's former bandmate Erdelyi was set to become their manager. Soon after the band was formed, Dee Dee realized that he could not sing and play his bass guitar simultaneously; with Erdelyi's encouragement, Joey became the band's new lead singer.<ref name="MM32"/> Dee Dee would continue, however, to count off each song's tempo with his signature rapid-fire shout of "1-2-3-4!" Joey soon similarly realized that he could not sing and play drums simultaneously and left the position of drummer. While auditioning prospective replacements, Erdelyi would often take to the drums and demonstrate how to play the songs. It became apparent that he was able to perform the group's music better than anyone else, and he joined the band as Tommy Ramone.<ref name=MM33>Melnick and Meyer (2003), p.&nbsp;33.</ref>

The Ramones played before an audience for the first time on March 30, 1974, at Performance Studios.<ref name="HallofFame"/> The songs they played were very fast and very short; most clocked in at under two minutes. Around this time, a new music scene was emerging in New York centered on two clubs in [[Lower Manhattan|downtown Manhattan]]—[[Max's Kansas City]] and, more famously, [[CBGB]] (usually referred to as CBGB's). The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16, 1974.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/JohnnyRamone/photos/a.10150703813846521.491576.43468756520/10153036882146521/?type=1&theater Johnny Ramone - Timeline Photos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202080559/https://www.facebook.com/JohnnyRamone/photos/a.10150703813846521.491576.43468756520/10153036882146521/?type=1&theater |date=February 2, 2016 }}.

The band swiftly became regulars at the club, playing there seventy-four times by the end of the year. After garnering considerable attention for their performances—which averaged about seventeen minutes from beginning to end—the group was signed to a recording contract in late 1975 by [[Seymour Stein]] of [[Sire Records]].

Tommy, tired of touring, left the band in early 1978. He continued as the Ramones' record producer under his birth name of Erdelyi. His position as drummer was filled by [[Marky Ramone|Marc Bell]], who had been a member of the early 1970s hard rock band [[Dust (band)|Dust]], [[Jayne County|Wayne County]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/zrock/cast/marky-ramone.php|title=Cast and Crew: Marky Ramone|publisher=IFC.com|access-date=March 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509042128/http://www.ifc.com/zrock/cast/marky-ramone.php|archive-date=May 9, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and the pioneering punk group [[Richard Hell and the Voidoids]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p116834|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography Markey Ramone|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|website=Allmusic|access-date=October 20, 2009}}</ref> Bell adopted the name Marky Ramone. Later that year, the band released their fourth studio album, and first with Marky, ''[[Road to Ruin (Ramones album)|Road to Ruin]]''. The album, co-produced by Tommy with [[Ed Stasium]], included some new sounds such as acoustic guitar, several ballads, and the band's first two recorded songs longer than three minutes. It failed to reach the [[Billboard Top 100|''Billboard'' Top 100]]. However, "[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]", which appeared both on the album and as a single, would become one of the band's best-known songs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Boldman, Gina | url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t4297980|pure_url=yes}} | website=Allmusic | access-date=November 5, 2009| title=I Wanna Be Sedated}}</ref> The artwork on the album's cover was done by ''Punk'' magazine cofounder [[John Holmstrom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=5901|title=John Holmstrom: Floating in a Bottle of Formaldehyde|last=Morgan|first=Jeffrey|date=February 4, 2004|work=[[Metro Times]]|publisher=[[Times-Shamrock Communications]]|access-date=November 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605180207/http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=5901|archive-date=June 5, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the band's movie debut in [[Roger Corman]]'s ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'' (1979), producer [[Phil Spector]] became interested in the Ramones and produced their fifth album ''[[End of the Century]]'' (1980). There is a long-disputed rumor that during the recording sessions in Los Angeles, Spector held Dee Dee at gunpoint, forcing him to repeatedly play a riff.<ref>{{cite news| author = Harlow, John| title = Spector Calls Ex-Wife for Murder Defence| work = Sunday Times| date = March 18, 2007| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article1530531.ece| access-date = November 5, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100604024438/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article1530531.ece| archive-date = June 4, 2010| url-status = dead}}</ref> Although it was to be the highest-charting album in the band's history—reaching number 44 in the United States and number 14 in Great Britain—Johnny made clear that he favored the band's more aggressive punk material: "''End of the Century'' was just watered-down Ramones. It's not the real Ramones."<ref>Leigh and McNeil (2009), p. 201.</ref> This stance was also conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album Johnny later oversaw, ''[[Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits]]''. Despite these reservations, Johnny did concede that some of Spector's work with the band had merit, saying "It really worked when he got to a slower song like '[[Danny Says]]'—the production really worked tremendously.

After the release of ''Subterranean Jungle'', Marky was fired from the band due to his alcoholism.<ref>Bessman (1993), p. 127.</ref><ref name=":0" /> He was replaced by Richard Reinhardt, who adopted the name [[Richie Ramone]].

The first album the Ramones recorded with Richie was ''[[Too Tough to Die]]'' in 1984, with Tommy Erdelyi and Ed Stasium returning as producers. The album marked a shift to something like the band's original sound. In the description of Allmusic's [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], the "rhythms are back up to jackhammer speed and the songs are down to short, terse statements."<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r16126|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Too Tough to Die'' Review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=Allmusic|access-date=July 31, 2011}}</ref>

The following year the band recorded their last album with Richie, ''[[Halfway to Sanity]]''.

Despite not wanting to be in the band anymore, Dee Dee (who was sober by this point) was present for the world tour for ''Brain Drain'' and played his last show with the Ramones on July 5, 1989, at One Step Beyond in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metroactive.com/features/columns/Silicon-Alleys-Ramones-Performances.html|title=Silicon Alleys: Club Owner Recalls the Fights That Fueled the Ramones' Performances|work=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]|date=July 3, 2019|access-date=January 23, 2021}}</ref> He was replaced by Christopher Joseph Ward ([[C.

===Final years (1990–1996)===
The band fulfilled their contract with Sire Records in 1991 after being on the label for over a decade and a half, ending with the release of ''[[Loco Live]]''. After leaving Sire Records, [[Brett Gurewitz]] of [[Bad Religion]] offered to sign the band to his label [[Epitaph Records]], even traveling to a concert in [[Amsterdam]] and begging Joey and Johnny. Meanwhile, Stormy Shepard from Leave Home Bookings (who was booking then-up-and-coming bands like [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[the Offspring]]) negotiated with the Ramones: "I'll put you on tour with these bands that are huge now. They're your fans; you can do whatever you want. You'll be playing in front of kids who like this style of music." At the same time, the band's manager, Gary Kurfurst had just worked out a deal where he was going to get his own record label, [[Radioactive Records]]. When C. J. Ramone heard Johnny talking about signing to Kurfirst's label, he questioned: "Johnny, you've run this band for years. You carried it all yourself. I don't understand how you don't see the conflict of interest in signing to your manager's label. Just in terms of business, I don't understand how you don't see that. You're really throwing away the last few years of your career. Those Epitaph guys grew up listening to you. They will do anything to give you the business success you never had. Your manager will do the same thing he always has. He's going to throw his stuff out there. You're going to break through without anyone's support and you're going to face the rest of your career the way it's been up until now." Johnny replied: "When you have as many years in the business as I do, then you can make the decisions."

By Johnny's decision, the group ended up signing a new contract with Radioactive Records at the end of that year, the Ramones were soon able to start on sessions for what would become ''[[Mondo Bizarro]]'' (1992),<ref>{{Cite web |last=Punknews.org |title=Interviews: CJ Ramone |url=https://www.punknews.org/article/59199/interviews-cj-ramone |access-date=2022-12-26 |website=www.punknews.org |date=October 22, 2015 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=CJ Ramone interview |url=http://markprindle.com/cjramone-i.htm |access-date=2022-12-26 |website=markprindle.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title='Mondo Bizarro': How Ramones Returned Refreshed For The 90s |url=http://thisisdig-com.nds.acquia-psi.com/feature/mondo-bizarro-ramones-album/ |access-date=2022-12-26 |website=Dig! |language=en-US |archive-date=December 26, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221226184656/http://thisisdig-com.nds.acquia-psi.com/feature/mondo-bizarro-ramones-album/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> which saw them reunited with producer Ed Stasium.<ref name="mondo">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r59309|pure_url=yes}}|title=Overview ''Mondo Bizarro''|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo |website=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=November 6, 2009}}</ref> Anticipated as a "comeback" for the band after years of decline in popularity,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1995-07-05-9507030241-story.html|website=[[The Buffalo News]]|title=ASLEEP AT THE TOP ZZ TOP PLAYS IT SAFE -- AND STALE|access-date=May 26, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://buffalonews.com/news/asleep-at-the-top-zz-top-plays-it-safe----and-stale/article_f649ae49-89ca-5fd5-b32a-f9bd932c297d.html|website=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|title=ADIOS, RAMONES?|access-date=May 26, 2021}}</ref> the album was certified Gold in Brazil after selling 100,000 copies, being the first Gold certification the Ramones were ever awarded,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pro-musicabr.org.br/home/certificados/?busca_artista=Ramones |title=''Associação Brasileira dos Produtores de Discos – ABPD'' |access-date=April 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412084202/http://pro-musicabr.org.br/home/certificados/?busca_artista=Ramones |archive-date=April 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Marcel Plasse, [http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1994/4/25/folhateen/33.html "RAMONES"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202094358/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/1994/4/25/folhateen/33.html |date=February 2, 2017 }}, ''Folha de São Paulo''</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLThZI2s7yE |title=Award footage by ''MTV Brasil'' |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=April 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504214423/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLThZI2s7yE |archive-date=May 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> while its lead single "[[Poison Heart]]" was another top ten hit in the US for the band.<ref name="modernrock"/> ''[[Acid Eaters]]'', consisting entirely of cover songs, came out in 1993.<ref name="acid">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r191418|pure_url=yes}}|title=Overview ''Acid Eaters''|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas |website=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=November 6, 2009}}</ref> That same year, the Ramones were featured in the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', providing music and voices for animated versions of themselves in the episode "[[Rosebud (The Simpsons)|Rosebud]],"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season5/page3.shtml|title=''The Simpsons'' "Rosebud"|publisher=BBC|access-date=November 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405005818/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season5/page3.shtml|archive-date=April 5, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> marking the series' first guest appearance by a punk band.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Whatley |first=Jack |date=2020-06-07 |title=The Ramones give The Simpsons its first punk gig back in 1993 |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/ramones-the-simpsons-appearance-1993/ |access-date=2025-07-15 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref> Executive producer [[David Mirkin]] described the Ramones as "gigantic, obsessive ''Simpsons'' fans."<ref>Archer, Wes.

On March 18, 2002, the Ramones were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], which specifically named Dee Dee, Johnny, Joey, Tommy, and Marky. At the ceremony, the surviving inductees spoke on behalf of the band. Johnny spoke first, thanking the band's fans and blessing [[George W. Bush]] and his presidency, and America. Tommy spoke next, saying how honored the band felt, but how much it would have meant for Joey. Dee Dee humorously congratulated and thanked himself, while Marky thanked Tommy for influencing his drum style. [[Green Day]] played "Teenage Lobotomy", "Rockaway Beach", and "[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]" as a tribute, demonstrating the Ramones' continuing influence on later rock musicians. The ceremony was one of Dee Dee's last public appearances, as he was found dead on June 5, 2002, from a [[heroin overdose]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web|author=Pareles, Jon|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E4D9143DF934A35755C0A9649C8B63|title=Dee Dee Ramone, Pioneer Punk Rocker, Dies at 50|work=The New York Times|date=June 7, 2002|access-date=November 3, 2009}}</ref>

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
The Ramones' loud, fast, straightforward musical style was influenced by [[pop music]] that the band members grew up listening to in the 1950s and 1960s, including [[classic rock]] groups such as [[Buddy Holly and the Crickets]], [[the Beach Boys]], [[the Who]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Kinks]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Doors]] and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]; [[Bubblegum music|bubblegum]] acts like the [[1910 Fruitgum Company]] and [[Ohio Express]]; and girl groups such as [[the Ronettes]] and [[the Shangri-Las]]. They also drew on the harder rock sound of the [[MC5]], [[Black Sabbath]],<ref>{{cite book |last= Millard|first= André |date= 2004|title= The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon |publisher= JHU Press|page= 206|isbn= 0-8018-7862-4}}</ref> [[the Stooges]] and the [[New York Dolls]], now known as seminal [[proto-punk|protopunk]] bands.<ref>Bessman (1993), pp.&nbsp;17–18; {{cite magazine| author =Morris, Chris| title =Joey Ramone, Punk's First Icon, Dies| magazine =Billboard| date =April 29, 2001| url =http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4638922-1.html| access-date =November 5, 2009| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090104141935/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4638922-1.html| archive-date =January 4, 2009| url-status =live}} {{cite news| title = The Musical Misfits| publisher = BBC| date = April 16, 2001| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1279856.stm| access-date = November 5, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090115112303/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1279856.stm| archive-date = January 15, 2009| url-status = live}}</ref> The Ramones' style was in part a reaction against the heavily produced, often bombastic music that dominated the pop charts in the 1970s. "We decided to start our own group because we were bored with everything we heard," Joey once explained. "In 1974 everything was tenth-generation [[Elton John]], or overproduced, or just junk. Everything was long jams, long [[guitar solos]]&nbsp;...&nbsp;. We missed music like it used to be."<ref>Edelstein and McDonough (1990), p.&nbsp;178.</ref> Ira Robbins and Scott Isler of ''[[Trouser Press]]'' describe the result:

<blockquote>With just four chords and one manic tempo, [[New York City|New York]]'s Ramones blasted open the clogged arteries of mid-'70s rock, reanimating the music. Their genius was to recapture the short/simple aesthetic from which pop had strayed, adding a caustic sense of [[Trash culture|trash-culture]] humor and minimalist rhythm guitar sound.<ref name="TP">Isler and Robbins (1991), p.&nbsp;532.</ref></blockquote>

As leaders in the [[punk rock]] scene, the Ramones' music is strongly identified with that label.<ref name=mtvbio/> It has been noted that their recordings also helped the subgenre [[pop-punk]] to develop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diffuser.fm/best-pop-punk-songs/ |title=10 Best Pop-Punk Songs |work=[[Diffuser.fm]] |last=Robinson |first=Joe |date=January 23, 2013 |access-date=January 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112150150/http://diffuser.fm/best-pop-punk-songs/ |archive-date=January 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-1978-kicked-off-the-explosion-of-pop-punk/ |title=How 1978 Kicked Off the Explosion of Pop-Punk |work=[[Noisey]] |last=Heller |first=Jason |date=February 26, 2018 |access-date=January 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112150008/https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/mb53w3/how-1978-kicked-off-the-explosion-of-pop-punk |archive-date=January 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=punkco>{{cite web| title =Ramones Discography LPs| publisher =punk77.co.uk| url =http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/ramonesdiscographylps.htm| access-date =November 5, 2009| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20081221234244/http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/ramonesdiscographylps.htm| archive-date =December 21, 2008| url-status =live}} {{cite web| title =End of the Century: The Ramones| publisher =PBS| url =https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/endofthecentury/legacy.html| access-date =November 5, 2009| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100506053944/http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/endofthecentury/legacy.html| archive-date =May 6, 2010| url-status =dead}}</ref> Some have described certain Ramones songs as [[power pop]].<ref name="zivkovic">{{cite web |last1=Zivkovic |first1=Ljubinko |title=Power Pop: The Genre That Refuses To Go Away |url=https://medium.com/1ntune/power-pop-the-genre-that-refuses-to-go-away-fe9142bc9967 |website=Medium |access-date=May 23, 2022 |date=December 31, 2021}}</ref><ref name="powerpophof">{{cite web |title=The Ramones |url=https://powerpophalloffame.com/portfolio-posts/the-ramones/ |website=Power Pop Hall of Fame |access-date=May 23, 2022}}</ref><ref name=happyfamily>{{cite web| author =Holmstrom, John| title =Happy Family Interviews| publisher =RamonesMania.com| date =December 2004| url =http://www.ramonesmania.com/ramones-interviews.html| access-date =November 5, 2009| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090525035145/http://ramonesmania.com/ramones-interviews.html| archive-date =May 25, 2009| url-status =live}}</ref> Starting in the 1980s, the band sometimes veered into [[hardcore punk]] territory, as can be heard on albums such as ''[[Too Tough to Die]]''.<ref name="TP"/>

On stage, the band adopted a focused approach directly intended to increase the audience's concert experience. [[Johnny Ramone|Johnny]]'s instructions to [[C. J. Ramone|C. J.]] when preparing for his first live performances with the group were to play facing the audience, to stand with the bass slung low between spread legs, and to walk forward to the front of stage at the same time as he did. Johnny was not a fan of guitarists who performed facing their drummer, amplifier, or other band members.<ref>Fricke, David (1999). ''Hey Ho Let's Go!: The Anthology'' liner notes. Rhino Entertainment, R2&nbsp;75817.</ref>

===Visual imagery===
The Ramones' art and visual imagery complemented the themes of their music and performance. The members adopted a uniform look of long hair, [[leather jackets]], T-shirts, torn jeans, and [[sneakers]]. This fashion emphasized [[minimalism]]—a powerful influence on the [[punk rock|New York punk scene of the 1970s]]—and reflected the band's short, simple songs.<ref name=CS67>Colegrave and Sullivan (2001), p.&nbsp;67.</ref> [[Tommy Ramone]] recalled that, musically and visually, "We were influenced by comic books, movies, the [[Andy Warhol]] scene, and [[avant-garde films]]. I was a big ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine fan myself."<ref name=CS67/>

[[File:Ramones logo.jpg|thumb|right|The band's logo, based on the [[seal of the president of the United States]]]]

The band's logo was created by [[New York City]] artist [[Arturo Vega]], with guidance from the Ramones. Vega, a longtime friend, had allowed [[Joey Ramone|Joey]] and [[Dee Dee Ramone|Dee Dee]] to move into his loft.<ref name="McCain & McNeil, 211">McNeil and McCain (1996), p.&nbsp;211.</ref> He produced the band's T-shirts—their main source of income—basing most of the images on a black-and-white self-portrait photograph he had taken of his American bald eagle belt buckle, which appeared on the back sleeve of the Ramones' first album.<ref name=B40>Bessman (1993), p.&nbsp;40.</ref> He was inspired to create the band's logo after a trip to [[Washington, D.C.]]:

<blockquote>I saw them as the ultimate all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression&nbsp;.... I thought, "The Great [[Seal of the President of the United States]]" would be perfect for the Ramones, with the [[eagle]] holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression that would be used against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as [[apple pie]]. And since Johnny was such a [[baseball]] fanatic, we had the eagle hold a [[baseball bat]] instead of the Great Seal's arrows.<ref name=B40/></blockquote>

The scroll in the eagle's beak originally read "Look out below", but this was soon changed to "Hey ho let's go" after the opening lyrics of the band's first single, "[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]". The arrowheads on the shield came from a design on a polyester shirt Vega had bought. "Ramones" was spelled out in block capitals above the logo using plastic stick-on letters.<ref name="Bessman, 211"/> Where the presidential emblem read "Seal of the President of the United States" clockwise in the border around the eagle, Vega placed the pseudonyms of the band members: [[Johnny Ramone|Johnny]], Joey, Dee Dee, and Tommy. Over the years the names in the border would change as the band's line-up fluctuated.<ref>{{cite web| author =Vega, Arturo| title =My Ramones World| publisher =RamonesWorld.com| url =http://www.ramonesworld.com/unofficial/unofficial.html| access-date =November 5, 2009| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20101128203602/http://ramonesworld.com/unofficial/unofficial.html| archive-date =November 28, 2010| url-status =dead| df =mdy-all}}</ref>

"It's the American presidential seal—anyone can use it," said [[Marky Ramone]] of the logo's ubiquity. "We share the [[royalty payment|royalties]] on the t-shirt and on the merchandise. A lot of the kids wearing that shirt might not even have heard of the Ramones' music. I guess if you have the shirt, your curiosity might bring you to buy the music. Whatever, it is a strange phenomenon."<ref>Fortnam, Ian: "Heavy load"; ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' #216, November 2015, p138</ref>

==Legacy and influence==
The Ramones had a broad and lasting influence on the development of [[popular music]]. Music historian [[Jon Savage]] writes of their [[Ramones (album)|debut album]] that "it remains one of the few records that changed pop forever."<ref>Savage (1992), p.&nbsp;553.</ref> As described by [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], "The band's first four albums set the blueprint for punk, especially American punk and hardcore, for the next two decades."<ref>{{cite web|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5223|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Ramones: Biography|website=Allmusic|access-date=November 5, 2009}}</ref> ''Trouser Press''{{'s}} Robbins and Isler similarly wrote that the Ramones "not only spearheaded the original new wave/punk movement, but also drew the blueprint for subsequent hardcore punk bands".<ref name="TP"/> Punk journalist Phil Strongman writes, "In purely ''musical'' terms, the Ramones, in attempting to re-create the excitement of pre-Dolby rock, were to cast a huge shadow—they had fused a blueprint for much of the indie future."<ref name=St62/> Writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in 2001, [[Douglas Wolk]] described the Ramones as "easily the most influential group of the last 30 years."<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Wolk, Douglas|url=http://www.slate.com/id/104580/|title=I Wanna Be Joey|magazine=Slate|date=April 18, 2001|access-date=November 5, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131093321/http://www.slate.com/id/104580/|archive-date=January 31, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Ramones' [[Ramones (album)|eponymous debut album]] had an outsized effect relative to its modest sales, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. According to [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]] bassist [[Tony James (musician)|Tony James]], "Everybody went up three gears the day they got that first Ramones album.
