'''Hole''' was an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles]], California, in 1989.  It was founded by singer and guitarist [[Courtney Love]] and guitarist [[Eric Erlandson]]. It had several different bassists and drummers, the most prolific being drummer [[Patty Schemel]] and bassists [[Kristen Pfaff]] (d. 1994) and [[Melissa Auf der Maur]]. Hole released a total of four studio albums between two incarnations spanning the 1990s and early-2010s and became one of the most commercially successful rock bands in history fronted by a woman.{{sfn|Carson|Lewis|Shaw|2004|pages=89–90}}

Influenced by Los Angeles' [[punk rock]] scene, the band's debut album, ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'' (1991), was produced by [[Kim Gordon]] of [[Sonic Youth]], and attracted critical interest from British and American alternative press. Their second album, ''[[Live Through This]]'', released in 1994 by [[DGC Records]], combined elements of punk, [[grunge music|grunge]], and pop rock music,{{sfn|Kallen|2012|p=78}} and was widely acclaimed, reaching [[RIAA certification|platinum status]] within a year of its release. Their third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), marked a notable departure from their earlier punk influences, boasting a more commercially viable sound; the album sold around 2 million copies worldwide, and earned them significant critical acclaim.

They disbanded in 2002, and the members individually pursued other projects. Eight years later in 2010, Hole was reformed by Love with new members, despite Erlandson's claim that the reformation breached a mutual contract he had with her. The reformed band released the album ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' (2010), which was conceived as Love's second solo album. In 2013, Love retired the Hole name, releasing new material and touring as a solo artist.

Hole received several accolades, including four [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations. They were also commercially successful, selling over three million records in the United States alone, and had a far-reaching influence on contemporary female artists. Music and [[feminism|feminist]] scholars have also recognized the band as the most high-profile musical group of the 1990s to discuss gender issues in their songs, due to Love's aggressive and violent lyrical content, which often addressed themes of body image, abuse, and sexual exploitation.

Hole formed after [[Eric Erlandson]] responded to an advertisement placed by [[Courtney Love]] in ''[[The Recycler]]'' in the summer of 1989.  The advertisement read: "I want to start a band. My influences are [[Big Black]], [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Fleetwood Mac]]."{{Sfn|Brite|1998|p=100}} Erlandson recalled of their first meeting: "We met at this coffee shop, and I saw her and I thought 'Oh, God.

Love originally wanted to name the band Sweet Baby Crystal Powered by God, but opted for the name Hole instead.{{Sfn|Brite|1998|p=101}} During an interview on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'', she claimed the name for the band was partly inspired by a quote from [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'' that read: "There is a hole that pierces right through me."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1eICAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA41|title=Feminism Amplified|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|first=Kim|last=France|date=June 3, 1996|publisher=K-III Magazine Corporation|page=41|access-date=October 11, 2016|via=[[Google Books]]}} {{free access}}</ref> She also cited a conversation with her mother as the primary inspiration for the band's name, in which her mother told her that she couldn't live her life "with a hole running through her".<ref name="jools" /><ref name="flipside">{{cite magazine |title = Hole|number=68|date=September 1990 |magazine=[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]] |location=Los Angeles, California|author=Al & Gus}} Scans available [https://courtneylovescans.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/1990-hole-flipside/ here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313040740/https://courtneylovescans.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/1990-hole-flipside/ |date=March 13, 2017 }}.</ref> Love also acknowledged the "obvious" genital reference in the band's name, alluding to the [[vagina]].<ref name="jools" />

Hole released their [[no wave]]-influenced debut single "[[Retard Girl]]" in April 1990, and followed it with "[[Dicknail]]" in 1991, released on [[Sympathy for the Record Industry]] and [[Sub Pop]], respectively. According to disc jockey [[Rodney Bingenheimer]], Love would often approach him at a [[Denny's]] on [[Sunset Blvd.]] where he went for coffee in the mornings, and convinced him to give "Retard Girl" airtime on his station [[KROQ-FM]].<ref name="etrue">{{cite episode|series=The E!

''[[Live Through This]]'' was released on April 12, 1994, one week after Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, was found dead in his Seattle home.

Despite the critical praise for ''Live Through This'', rumors circulated insinuating that Cobain had actually written the majority of the album, though the band vehemently denies this.<ref name="behindthemusic" /> The band's drummer Patty Schemel, who had been friends with Cobain since the late 1980s,<ref name="hitsohard"/>  said: "There's that myth that Kurt [Cobain] wrote all our songs— it's not true. Courtney and Eric wrote ''Live Through This''."<ref name="behindthemusic" /> The band did, however, state that Love convinced Cobain to provide backing vocals on "[[Asking for It (Hole song)|Asking for It]]" and "[[Softer, Softest]]" while visiting the studio, and music producers and engineers present during the recording sessions noted that Cobain seemed "completely unfamiliar" with the songs.{{Sfn|Edwards|2006|p=88}} According to ''Rolling Stone'' rock journalist Gavin Edwards, Love and Cobain had written songs together in the past, but opted to not release them because it was "a bit too redolent of [[John Lennon|John]] and [[Yoko Ono|Yoko]]".{{Sfn|Edwards|2006|p=87}}

In 1994, bassist Kristen Pfaff went into a drug treatment facility to treat her heroin addiction. Pfaff contemplated leaving the band for health reasons.

In 1997, the band entered [[Conway Recording Studios]] in Los Angeles after attempts to write new material in Miami, New Orleans, London, and New York.<ref name=int/> Recorded over a ten-month period, Hole's third studio album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), adopted a complete new sound for the band, incorporating elements of power pop, and had Love drawing influences from [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]].<ref name="int">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Interview|others=Hole|year=1998|type=CD|publisher=Geffen|id=PRO-CD-1232}}</ref> According to Erlandson, Love was more focused on song-writing and singing than playing guitar on the record; Love stated that her aim for the album was to "deconstruct the [[California Sound|California sound]]" in the L.A. tradition of bands like [[The Doors]], [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Byrds]].<ref name="int" /> In addition to Hole, [[The Smashing Pumpkins|Smashing Pumpkins]] frontman [[Billy Corgan]] entered the studio and helped perfect five of the album's twelve songs.<ref name="int" /> Love, who felt she was in a creative slump, likened Corgan's presence in the studio to "a math teacher who wouldn't give you the answers but was making you solve the problems yourself".<ref name="int" />

==Artistry==
===Composition===
Initially, Hole drew inspiration from [[no wave]] and experimental bands, which is evident in their earliest recordings, specifically "[[Retard Girl]]", but frontwoman Love also drew from a variety of influences. Love cited [[post-punk]] group [[Echo & the Bunnymen]]<ref name="loder">{{cite interview |last=Love|first=Courtney|interviewer=Loder, Kurt|work=MTV Networks|title=The Hole Story|date=September 1, 1994}}</ref> and classic rock such as [[Neil Young]]<ref name=flipside/> and [[Fleetwood Mac]].{{sfn|Crawford|2014|p=67}} The band's first album, ''Pretty on the Inside'', was heavily influenced by noise and punk rock, using discordant melodies, distortion, and feedback, with Love's vocals ranging from whispers to guttural screams.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=532}} Love described the band's earliest songwriting as being based on "really crazy [[Sonic Youth]] tunings".<ref name="bigday">{{cite interview|title=Hole interviewed at Big Day Out tour |date=1999 |interviewer=''[[Ground Zero (television show)|Ground Zero]]'' |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YQzcfnTb4o |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117052304/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YQzcfnTb4o |archive-date=November 17, 2015 }}</ref> Nonetheless, Love claimed to have aimed for a [[pop music|pop]] sound early on: "There's a part of me that wants to have a [[grindcore]] band and another that wants to have a [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]]-type pop band",<ref name=flipside/> she told ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]'' magazine in 1991. Both Love and Erlandson were fans of the notorious LA punk band the [[Germs (band)|Germs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/germ-warfare-179286 |work=Newsweek |title=Germ Warfare |date=October 13, 1996 |access-date=March 9, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313021714/http://www.newsweek.com/germ-warfare-179286 |archive-date=March 13, 2017 }}</ref> In a 1996 interview for a Germs tribute documentary, Erlandson said: "I think every band is based on one song, and our band was based on "[[Forming (song)|Forming]]"&nbsp;... Courtney brought it into rehearsal, and she knew, like, three [[Chord (music)|chords]] and it was the only punk rock song we could play."<ref name="germs">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvCdFHwqb1s |title=Erlandson, Eric.

The band's second album ''Live Through This'', captured a less abrasive sound, while maintaining the group's original punk roots. "I want this record to be shocking to the people who don't think we have a soft edge, and at the same time, [to know] that we haven't lost our very, very hard edge",<ref>Love, Courtney; Patty Schemel. Promotional Interview Segment for ''Live Through This''. MTV Networks. 1994.</ref> Love told VH1 in 1994. The group's third album, ''Celebrity Skin'', incorporated power pop into their hard rock sound, and was heavily inspired by California bands; Love was also influenced by Fleetwood Mac and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] while writing the album.<ref name="int" />{{Sfn|''Celebrity Skin''|1999|p=2}} The group's 2010 release, ''Nobody's Daughter'', featured a more folk rock-oriented sound, utilizing acoustic guitar and softer melodies.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Hole: Nobody's Daughter|author=Deem, Anna|date=April 27, 2010|access-date=February 4, 2018|url=https://www.popmatters.com/124390-hole-nobodys-daughter-2496200621.html}}</ref>

The group's [[chord progression]]s by and large drew on elements of punk music,<ref name="spingreatest">{{cite news|author=Weisbard, Eric|work=Spin|date=September 1999|title=The Greatest Albums of the '90s|page=120}}</ref> which Love described as "grungey", although not necessarily [[grunge]].{{Sfn|Strong|2011|p=50}} Critics described their song style as "deceptively wispy and strummy",<ref name="spingreatest" /> combined with "gunshot guitar choruses".<ref name=fricke/> Although the group's sound changed over the course of their career, the dynamic between beauty and ugliness has often been noted, particularly due to the layering of harsh and abrasive riffs which often bury more sophisticated arrangements.<ref name="oct91">{{cite news|work=Spin|date=October 1991|title=Hole Lotta Love|page=32|first=Daisy|last=Von Furth|issn=0886-3032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGjqAHJs488C|via=Google Books|volume=7|issue=7}} {{free access}}</ref>

===Lyrical content===
In a 1991 interview, Love stated that lyrics were "the most important" element of songwriting for her.<ref name=flipside/> Her lyrics explored a variety of themes throughout Hole's career, including [[body image]], rape, [[child abuse]], addiction, [[celebrity]], suicide, elitism, and [[inferiority complex|inferiority complexes]]; all of which were addressed mainly from a female, and often [[feminism|feminist]] standpoint.{{Sfn|Burns|Lafrance|2002|pages=98–103}} This underlying feminism in Love's lyrics often led the public and critics to mistakenly associate her with the [[riot grrrl]] movement, of which Love was highly critical.<ref name="reillyphoebe">{{cite magazine |magazine=Spin |date=October 2005|pages=70–72|title=Courtney Love: Let the healing begin |last=Reilly |first=Phoebe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOIh4tn8TGYC&q=Look,+you've+got+these+highly+intelligent+imperious+girls,+but+who+told+them+it+was+their+undeniable+American+right+not+to+be+offended&pg=RA1-PA70|volume=21|issue=2|issn=0886-3032|via=Google Books}} {{free access}}</ref>{{Sfn|Brite|1998|p=117}}{{Sfn|Feigenbaum|2007|p=135}}

In a 1991 interview with [[Everett True]], Love said: "I try to place [beautiful imagery] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things&nbsp;... I sometimes feel that no one's taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space."<ref name="sidelines">{{cite news|work=Melody Maker|date=June 15, 1991|author=True, Everett|title=Hole in Sidelines|page=8}}</ref> [[Charles R. Cross|Charles Cross]] has referred to her lyrics on ''Live Through This'' as being "true extensions of her diary",<ref name="behindthemusic" /> and she has admitted that a great deal of the lyrics from ''Pretty on the Inside'' were excisions from her journals.<ref name="bigday" />

Throughout Hole's career, Love's lyrics were often influenced by literature: The title of the band's second album ''Live Through This'', for example (as well as lyrics from the track "[[Asking for It (Hole song)|Asking for It]]") is directly drawn from ''[[Gone with the Wind (song)|Gone With the Wind]]'';<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[The Return of Courtney Love]]|people=Yapp, Will (director); Love, Courtney (subject)|year=2006|publisher=[[More4]]}}</ref> and the group's single "[[Celebrity Skin]]"  (the title track to their 1998 album), contains quotes from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FD4jKFVQOhMC&q=celebrity+skin+shakespeare&pg=PT6|volume=14|issue=10|issn=0886-3032 |magazine=Spin |title=Hole: Celebrity Skin|series=Reviews|page=136|date=October 1998|via=Google Books}} {{free access}}</ref> and  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Dante Rossetti]]'s poem ''A Superscription''.{{Sfn|Latham|2003|p=2}} Love had had a minor background in literature, having briefly studied English literature in her early twenties.<ref name="thepoweroflove">{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1994/08/12/courtney-love-comes-out-hiding/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |title=Courtney Love Comes Out of Hiding |author=Kennedy, Dana |date=August 12, 1994 |archive-date=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709093133/http://www.ew.com/article/1994/08/12/courtney-love-comes-out-hiding |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Performances===
Throughout the duration of the 1990s, the band received widespread media coverage due to Love's often rambunctious and unpredictable behavior onstage.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ew.com/article/1995/07/28/courtney-love-causes-trouble-lollapolooza/ |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |title=Courtney Love causes trouble at Lollapolooza |date=July 28, 1995 |access-date=September 25, 2015 |author=Smith, Ethan |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924110935/http://www.ew.com/article/1995/07/28/courtney-love-causes-trouble-lollapolooza |archive-date=September 24, 2015 }}</ref> The band often destroyed equipment and guitars at the end of concerts,<ref name=sp/> and Love would ramble between songs, bring fans onstage, and [[stage dive]], sometimes returning with clothes torn off of her or injuries sustained.<ref name="walters">{{cite interview|last=Walters|first=Barbara|interviewer=Courtney Love|work=The Barbara Walters Special|title=Interview with Barbara Walters|publisher=ABC|date=August 1995}}</ref> In a 1995 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine article, journalist John Homans addressed Love's frequent stage diving during Hole's concerts:

<blockquote>The most shocking, frightening, and fascinating image in rock in the last few years is Courtney Love's stage dive&nbsp;... When some male performers do it, it looks like muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression&nbsp;... For obvious reasons, the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, but Love, typically, decided that she wanted to do it, too. Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being [[rape]]d, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about every show.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |last=Homans |first=John |date=February 20, 1995|title=Love Trouble|pages=64–65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nOMCAAAAMBAJ&q=courtney+love+stage+diving&pg=PA64|issue=2|volume=28|via=Google Books}} {{free access}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Nina Gordon]] of [[Veruca Salt]], who toured with Hole in 1995, recalled Love's erratic behavior onstage, saying "She would just go off and [the rest of the band] would just kind of stand there."<ref name="hitsohard" /> The majority of Love's chaotic behavior onstage was a result of heavy drug use at the time, which she admitted: "I was completely high on dope; I cannot remember much about it."<ref name="hitsohard" /> She later criticized her behavior during that time, saying: "I [saw] pictures of how I looked. It's disgusting. I'm ashamed. There's death and there's disease and there's misery and there's giving up your soul&nbsp;... The human spirit mixed with certain powders is not the person, it's [a] demonic presence."<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Spin |date=October 1998|pages=90–100|title=The Love Issue|first=Phillip|last=Weiss}}</ref>

Love's stage attire also garnered notoriety, influenced in part by [[Carroll Baker]]'s wardrobe in the film ''[[Baby Doll]]'' (1956).{{Sfn|Brite|1998|p=110}} The style was later dubbed "[[kinderwhore]]" by the media, and consisted of [[babydoll]] dresses, [[slip (clothing)|slip]]s and [[nightgown]]s, and smeared makeup.{{Sfn|Klaffke|2003|p=116}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/01/22/courtney-love-nobodys-daughter/ |work=Spinner |date=2010-01-22 |title=Courtney Love Is Learning to Rein In the 'Courtney Monster' |author=Baltin, Steve |access-date=June 3, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210014402/http://www.spinner.com/2010/01/22/courtney-love-nobodys-daughter/ |archive-date=February 10, 2013 }}</ref> [[Kurt Loder]] likened her onstage attire to a "debauched ragdoll",<ref name="loderfiles">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585956/courtney-love-opens-up-about-kurt-cobains-death-loder-files.jhtml |work=MTV |title=Courtney Love Opens Up About Kurt Cobain's Death |series=The Loder Files |date=April 22, 2008 |archive-date=October 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020094216/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585956/courtney-love-opens-up-about-kurt-cobains-death-loder-files.jhtml |author=Loder, Kurt |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[John Peel]] noted in his review of the band's 1994 Reading Festival performance, that "[Love], swaying wildly and with lipstick smeared on her face, hands and, I think, her back, as well as on the collar of her dress,&nbsp;... would have drawn whistles of astonishment in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]. The band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot remember having felt before from any stage."<ref name="atreading"/> ''Rolling Stone'' referred to the style as "a slightly more politically charged version of grunge; apathy turned into ruinous angst, which soon became high fashion's favorite pose."<ref>{{cite magazine

The band's set lists for live shows were often loose, featuring improvisational jams and rough performances of unreleased songs. By 1998, their live performances had become less aggressive and more restrained, although Love continued to bring fans onstage, and would often go into the crowd while singing.<ref name="natgeo" />

==Legacy==
Hole was one of the most commercially successful female-fronted [[alternative rock]] bands in history, selling over 3 million records in the United States between 1991 and 2010.<ref name="harding">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958756/courtney-love-fixing-a-hole |magazine=Billboard |title=Courtney Love: Fixing a Hole |date=April 2, 2010 |access-date=October 21, 2013 |author=Harding, Cortney |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622004934/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958756/courtney-love-fixing-a-hole |archive-date=June 22, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=callsit>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75641/hole-calls-it-a-career |magazine=Billboard |title=Hole Calls It A Career |access-date=October 21, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622004957/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75641/hole-calls-it-a-career |archive-date=June 22, 2014 }}</ref>{{Sfn|Carson|Lewis|Shaw|2004|pages=89–90}} In spite of Love's often polarizing reputation in the media, Hole received consistent critical praise for their output, and was often noted for the predominant feminist commentary found in Love's lyrics, which scholars have credited as "articulating a [[third-wave feminist]] consciousness".<ref>{{cite conference |author=Morris, Matthew |title=Writing (Courtney) Love into the History of Rhetoric: Articulation of a Feminist Consciousness in Live Through This |date=November 11, 2009 |conference=95th Annual Convention of the National Communication Association |url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/3/2/9/6/4/p329640_index.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120193238/http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/3/2/9/6/4/p329640_index.html |archive-date=November 20, 2012 |access-date=September 11, 2013 }}</ref> Love's subversive onstage persona and public image coincided with the band's songs, which expressed "pain, sorrow, and anger, but [an] underlying message of survival, particularly survival in the face of overwhelming circumstances".{{Sfn|Gaar| 2002 |p=397}} Music journalist [[Maria Raha]] expressed a similar sentiment in regard to the band's significance to third-wave feminism, stating, "Whether you love Courtney [Love] or hate her, Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism."{{Sfn|Schippers|2002|p=93}}

While ''Rolling Stone'' compared the effect of Love's marriage to Cobain on the band to that of [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]], they noted that "Love's confrontational stage presence, as well as her gut-wrenching vocals and powerful punk-pop songcraft, made her an alternative-rock star in her own right."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/hole/biography |magazine=Rolling Stone |title=Hole: Bio |access-date=April 1, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406191542/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/hole/biography |archive-date=April 6, 2013 }}</ref> Author Nick Wise made a similar comparison in discussion of the band's public image, stating, "Not since Yoko Ono's marriage to John Lennon has a woman's personal life and exploits within the rock arena been so analyzed and dissected."{{Sfn|Lankford|2009|page=73}}

In 2008 [[2008 Universal fire|a fire]] swept through [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] destroying buildings belonging to [[Universal Music Group]].
