'''Bullet for My Valentine''', often abbreviated as '''BFMV''', <!-- Please do not change this to "is." -->are<!-- This article is written in UK English, which treats collective nouns as plurals.

The band is currently composed of [[Matthew Tuck]] (vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar), Jamie Mathias (bass) and [[Jason Bowld]] (drums). Former members include Michael Thomas, Jason James and Nick Crandle; the latter were on bass.

Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine.

They released another two-track [[Extended play|EP]] in 2002, ''You/Play with Me'', which was produced by Greg Haver.<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine biography"/> The EP was financed through the Pynci scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s broadcast at [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]'s [[TJ's|T.J.'s]].<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine biography"/> Shortly after, the band released another two-track [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''Eye Spy''. In 2003, their second EP was released titled ''Don't Walk Away''. This was a promotional CD and was shipped to different record companies, as well as being given out locally in Bridgend. Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for the band's self-titled EP and was replaced by Jason James,<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine biography" /> and the band changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine shortly thereafter.<ref name="R13 interview" /> In late 2003, they released their final EP before record labels actually began to notice their potential. This happened due to the sudden change in their strategy and sound, which the band claims came "directly out of their heads."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/jeffkjohn|title=Jeff Killed John|work=Myspace|access-date=7 August 2013|archive-date=2 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235024/https://myspace.com/jeffkjohn|url-status=live}}</ref> Their self-titled EP consisted of five songs; most of the songs became precursors of tracks from ''[[The Poison]]''.

[[Roadrunner Records]] showed interest in Bullet for My Valentine and offered the band a deal. The offer was ultimately turned down, and the band signed a five-album record deal with [[Sony BMG]] and a UK licensing deal with [[Visible Noise]]. According to Tuck, they chose Sony because, "We thought that a lot more doors would be open to us."<ref name="R13 interview">{{cite web|title=Bullet for My Valentine Interview|publisher=Room Thirteen|date=8 July 2005|url=http://www.roomthirteen.com/cgi-bin/feature_view.cgi?FeatureID=185|access-date=30 October 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112164113/http://www.roomthirteen.com/cgi-bin/feature_view.cgi?FeatureID=185 |archive-date = 12 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> A [[Bullet for My Valentine (EP)|self-titled]] EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK.

Daniel Lukes of ''[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel Magazine]]'' reviewed the EP by stating, "The worst part is that the music itself isn't all that bad, for the genre."

Matt Tuck spoke to Daniel Marez of ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' in March 2009 about the band's progress on writing and recording their third album.

Tuck said that the band tried to please people like critics and journalists with ''Scream Aim Fire''. Tuck said: "''Scream Aim Fire'' was an album we wrote to try to prove people wrong, and wasn't an album we made for ourselves. ''Fever'' is an album that was a hundred percent us; we didn't listen to anyone's opinions, what critics' opinions were, or what people thought we should do, or how we should sound."<ref name=HittheLights>{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Gray|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/hit_the_lights_bfmv_we_do_what_we_do_and_were_pretty_f--king_good_at_it.html|title=Hit The Lights: BFMV: 'We Do What We Do, And We're Pretty Fucking Good at It'|work=[[Ultimate Guitar|Ultimate-Guitar]]|date=24 April 2010|access-date=11 July 2022|archive-date=22 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220822070213/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/hit_the_lights_bfmv_we_do_what_we_do_and_were_pretty_f--king_good_at_it.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Tuck also said about ''Scream Aim Fire'': "Some of it was written a hundred percent for us, but we tried a little bit too hard to be metal when we should've just carried on doing what we did really - like we did on all of ''The Poison'' material."<ref name=HittheLights /> When Tuck was asked if he defines Bullet for My Valentine as a heavy metal band or a hard rock band, Tuck said: {{blockquote|I dunno. I could say both, to be honest. Regardless of what I say, people are gonna think differently, so it doesn't really matter. People label us in genres all the time which aren't accurate, or a true representation, which shows that some people aren't really paying attention. People can call it whatever they want, whether they like it or don't like it.<ref name=HittheLights />}}
