'''Cake''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Sacramento, California]], consisting of singer [[John McCrea (musician)|John McCrea]], trumpeter [[Vince DiFiore]], guitarist Xan McCurdy, bassist Daniel McCallum, and drummer Todd Roper. The band has been noted for McCrea's droll sarcastic lyrics and deadpan vocals, and their wide-ranging musical influences, including [[Norteño (music)|norteño]], [[honky tonk|country music]], [[mariachi]], [[disco]], [[rock music|rock]], [[funk]], [[folk music]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].

Cake was formed in August of 1991 by McCrea, DiFiore, [[Greg Brown (rock musician)|Greg Brown]] (guitar), [[Frank French]] (drums), and Shon Meckfessel (bass) who soon left and was replaced by [[Gabe Nelson]]. Following the self-release of its debut album, ''[[Motorcade of Generosity]]'', the band was signed to [[Capricorn Records]] in 1995 and released its first single, "[[Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle]]", which hit number&nbsp;35 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] music chart and was featured on MTV's ''[[120 Minutes]]''; French and Nelson then left the band, and were replaced by Todd Roper and Victor Damiani. Cake's second album, 1996's ''[[Fashion Nugget]]'', went platinum on the strength of its lead single, "[[The Distance (Cake song)|The Distance]]". Following a tour of Europe and the United States, both Brown and Damiani announced they were leaving Cake, which led to speculation about the band's future; McCrea eventually recruited Xan McCurdy to take over on guitar, and persuaded Nelson to return.

''[[Prolonging the Magic]]'', the band's third album, was released in 1998 and went platinum, having shipped over one million units; this was followed three years later by ''[[Comfort Eagle]]'', the band's first album on [[Columbia Records]], featuring the single "[[Short Skirt/Long Jacket]]" which hit number&nbsp;7 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. Following a series of tours, including several versions of the Unlimited Sunshine Tour, the band released ''[[Pressure Chief]]'' in 2004, its second and last album on Columbia. After creating its own label, [[Upbeat Records]], the band released ''[[Showroom of Compassion]]'' in 2011, which became its first album to debut at the top of the ''Billboard'' charts, selling 44,000 copies in the first week after release. Their studio output has been minimal since 2011, although they have continued to tour and have occasionally hinted at an upcoming album.

==History==

===Formation and ''Motorcade of Generosity'' (1991–1996)===
Cake was formed in 1991 when John McCrea, a Sacramento, California native who had moved to Los Angeles with a band only to see it "quickly crumble around him", returned to Sacramento.<ref name="mont1">{{cite news|title=Cake man talks about economic importance of short skirts|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 2, 2001|work=[[UWIRE]]}}</ref> He began looking for a new band to play with, having "grown tired of Sacramento's coffeehouse circuit",<ref name="jg1">{{cite news|title=Taking Cake|last=Green|first=Joshua|date=October 10, 1996|work=Westword|publisher=Village Voice Media}}</ref> and quickly attracted trumpet player [[Vince DiFiore]], guitarist [[Greg Brown (rock musician)|Greg Brown]], bassist Shon Meckfessel, and drummer [[Frank French]]. All were active in the music scene at the time; DiFiore notes that "[McCrea] came back and stole us from other bands".<ref name="sjmn1">{{cite news|title=Cake Gets a Taste of Success|last=Hopewell|first=Deb|date=September 20, 1996|work=San Jose Mercury News|publisher=MediaNews Group}}</ref> The band soon came up with the name "Cake"; rather than referring to the [[cake|food]], the name is meant to be "like when something insidiously becomes a part of your life...[we] mean it more as something that cakes onto your shoe and is just sort of there until you get rid of it".<ref name="cst1">{{cite news|title=Goofy Cake skewers 'cool'; Hipsters beware|last=Kim|first=Jae-Ha|date=October 4, 1996|work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=Sun-Times Media Group}}</ref> Meckfessel soon left to attend college and was replaced by [[Gabe Nelson]]. After touring and becoming part of the club scene in San Francisco, the band independently recorded and released ''[[Motorcade of Generosity]]'' in 1994,<ref name="sfc1">{{cite news|title=Cake Gets a Sweet Deal|last=Snyder|first=Michael|date=January 8, 1995|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=Hearst Corporation}}</ref> selling copies from their van as a method of paying touring expenses.<ref name="slc1">{{cite news|title=For Those Craving a Mix, Well, Let Them Eat Cake|last=Renzhofer|first=Martin|date=October 11, 1996|work=Salt Lake Tribune|publisher=MediaNews Group}}</ref>

''Motorcade'' was named one of the best indie releases of 1994 by ''[[Pulse! magazine|Pulse!]]'',<ref name="sjmn1" /> and after a concert at the [[Great American Music Hall]], [[Bonnie Simmons]] agreed to manage the band, leading to them signing a deal with [[Capricorn Records]], who re-released the album in 1995. The first single, "[[Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle]]", hit number&nbsp;35 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] music chart<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Modern Rock Tracks|date=April 29, 1995|magazine=Billboard|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref> and was featured on MTV's [[120 Minutes]].<ref name="sjmn1" /> Critical reactions to the album were largely positive; Stephen Thompson in the ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' described it as possessing "great lyrics, creative instrumentation and production that's about as simple as production gets",<ref>{{cite news|title=Cake Should Be Even Better In Live Show|last=Thompson|first=Stephen|date=September 21, 1995|work=Wisconsin State Journal|publisher=Lee Enterprises}}</ref> {{interlanguage link|Thomas Conner (journalist)|lt=Thomas Conner|de|Thomas Conner}} praised it for being "soulful and smooth, witty and gritty, this record makes the ghosts of [[Bob Wills]], [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Lou Reed]] smile" in the ''[[Tulsa World]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Music & More in '95|last=Conner|first=Thomas|author-link=:de:Thomas Conner|date=December 31, 1995|work=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company}}</ref> and Matt Weitz in the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' noted its "gimlet eye and sardonic humor".<ref name="do1">{{cite news|title=Out There|last=Weitz|first=Matt|date=October 24, 1996|work=Dallas Observer|publisher=Village Voice Media}}</ref> The album was eventually nominated for a [[BAM (magazine)|Bammy Award]] in the category of "Outstanding Debut Album".<ref>{{cite news|title=New Bammie Awards Expanded To Reflect Diversity, Creativity of San Francisco Area Music Scene|date=December 15, 1995|work=PR Newswire|publisher=UBM plc}}</ref>

Nevertheless, some critics were less appreciative; John Wirt, in ''[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]'', praised the album's sense of humor and "delicious" irreverence but noted that "[the] musicianship in ''Motorcade of Generosity'' suggests the Cake guys are mediocre players".<ref>{{cite news|title=The Advocate|last=Wirt|first=John|date=June 2, 1995|publisher=Capital City Press}}</ref> Mindy LaBernz, in ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'', described the album as "cover-free, and, since we're on the subject, genre-free. A quartet made five by a trumpet player, Cake carry themselves with the snittiness of technically proficient, lyrically aware music lovers, who are almost anachronistically untrendy and brazenly proud of it".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol14/issue36/recviews.html|title=Record Reviews|last=LaBernz|first=Mindy|date=May 5, 1995|work=Austin Chronicle Corp.|publisher=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=June 11, 2011}}</ref> The signing to Capricorn and re-release of ''Motorcade'' led to both French and Nelson leaving the band, citing their dislike of "the prospect of extensive national touring"; they were replaced by Todd Roper and [[Victor Damiani]], respectively.<ref name="allm2" />

===''Fashion Nugget'' (1996–1998)===
''[[Fashion Nugget]]'', Cake's second album, was released on 17 September 1996. Like ''Motorcade'', it was produced by the band and released on Capricorn Records.<ref name="sjmn1" /> Cake considered the album more professionally produced than ''Motorcade'', despite references to its "raw" sound,<ref>{{cite news|title=Musical Diversity is the Icing for Cake Band|last=Iwasaki|first=Scott|date=October 11, 1996|work=Deseret News|publisher=Deseret Management Corporation}}</ref> and the reception was again generally positive; critics noted the broadening of Cake's sound, with Joshua Green noting in the ''[[Westword]]'' that "''Nugget'' spans a broader range of topics than did ''Motorcade'', with similarly appealing results",<ref name="jg1" /> and Matt Weitz in the ''Dallas Observer'' saying that "The gimlet eye and sardonic humor of 1994's ''Motorcade of Generosity'' is intact, but ''Fashion Nugget'' is aptly named; it updates ''Motorcade'' with beatboxy soul and hip-hop rhythms".<ref name="do1" /> The album's first single, "[[The Distance (Cake song)|The Distance]]", written by Greg Brown,<ref>{{cite news|title=Cake Puts 'The Distance' Into Radio Mix|date=January 17, 1997|work=The Daily News of Los Angeles|publisher=[[Los Angeles Newspaper Group]]}}</ref> became the band's biggest hit to date and is considered their "ubiquitous" song;<ref name="allm">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p24137|title=Cake|last=Huey|first=Steve|website=Allmusic|access-date=June 12, 2011}}</ref> it hit number 5 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Alternative 30]],<ref>{{cite journal|date=December 16, 1996|title=Alternative 30|journal=RPM|volume=64|issue=18}}</ref> and entered the Modern Rock Tracks top&nbsp;5.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Many Flavours of Cake Band's Style Mix Challenges Alt-Rock's Rule & Serves Up Recipe For Chart Success|last=Farber|first=Jim|date=November 25, 1996|work=Daily News|publisher=Mortimer Zuckerman}}</ref>

1997 also saw lineup changes; bassist Victor Damiani and guitarist Greg Brown both left, prompting speculation about the band's survival; McCrea noted that "Musically, there was a really great symbiosis and I really felt that it (their departures, especially Brown's) was the most stupid thing in the world", and said that he had considered dissolving the band.<ref name="gz">{{cite news|title=Cake: A new slice off the old rock|last=Khwaja|first=Sophy|date=November 8, 1998|work=The Gazette}}</ref> Damiani and McCrea have not been on good terms ever since his departure.

===''Prolonging the Magic'' (1998–2001)===
With Brown and Damiani's departure, McCrea felt "free to experiment" with the next album, 1998's ''[[Prolonging the Magic]]''; he wrote and produced every song.<ref name="gz" /> As a result of this experimentation, the album was noted as "loaded with spiced-up instrumentation, including a few new ingredients like the pedal steel guitar and musical saw thrown in for extra flavour". McCrea stated that he deliberately "approached writing this record without the guitar as the central assumption of all life in the universe".<ref name="gz" /> ''[[Music Week]]'' described it as an "inspired collection of leftfield rock",<ref>{{cite news|title=Reviews – For Records Out On 5 October 1998|date=September 26, 1998|work=[[Music Week]]|publisher=[[UBM plc]]}}</ref> while Thor Christensen of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' said that it "brims with the same dry humor the Sacramento band displayed in past hits such as 'The Distance' and 'Rock and Roll Lifestyle': The leadoff track, 'Satan Is My Motor', puts a devilish new spin on the rock 'n' roll car-song tradition, while 'When You Sleep' revolves around the question of what your fingers do while the rest of the body snoozes".<ref>{{cite news|title=Radio won't allow much giggle room|last=Christensen|first=Thor|date=October 8, 1998|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|publisher=[[A.

===''Comfort Eagle'' (2001–2004)===
For their fourth album, ''[[Comfort Eagle]]'', the band signed a deal with [[Columbia Records]]. ''Comfort Eagle'' was both produced and arranged by the band, and was recorded at Paradise Studios in Sacramento and Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco. Following the recording, drummer Todd Roper left the band, citing the demands extended touring would put on his time, and the commitments his two children, Griffin and Bella, represented. He was replaced by [[Pete McNeal]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Lindsay William-Ross |url=http://laist.com/2012/05/01/mistrial_in_case_of_ex-cake_drummer.php |title=Ex-Cake Drummer Accused of Molesting Child May Be Retried After Mistrial |publisher=LAist |date=2012-05-01 |access-date=2013-02-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504005434/http://laist.com/2012/05/01/mistrial_in_case_of_ex-cake_drummer.php |archive-date=May 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The album's release was preceded by the release of its first single, "[[Short Skirt/Long Jacket]]", described as a parable about "the relationship between prosperity and the population boom&nbsp;...&nbsp;There's nothing more procreational than economic prosperity".<ref>{{cite news|title=New icing for Cake|last=Graff|first=Gary|date=July 24, 2001|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]}}</ref> An accompanying video was directed by McCrea,<ref>{{cite news|title=CAKE Comes to Columbia Records; Eagerly-Anticipated New Album, Comfort Eagle, In Stores July 24|date=July 16, 2001|work=[[Business Wire]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]}}</ref> and recorded using the [[DV (video format)|DV]] system;<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Music Videos Confront Digital Revolution|last=Hay|first=Carla|date=November 3, 2001|magazine=Billboard|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref> it featured ''[[vox populi]]'' recordings of members of the public listening to the song and giving their opinion.<ref>{{cite news|title=FAST FORWARD; Four bands try to freshen up the music video genre – with mixed results|last=Gubbins|first=Teresa|date=August 23, 2001|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|publisher=[[A.

I like it when it's a [[contrapuntal]] thing, where the guitar is doing one melody, the vocal is doing another melody, and the trumpet plays this third melody. If the music can be transparent enough, you can hear all three at the same time".<ref name="wid" />
