'''Barenaked Ladies''' ('''BNL''') are a<!--awards and nominations don't belong here--> Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band which was formed in 1988 in the [[Toronto]] [[suburb]] of [[Scarborough, Ontario]]. The band developed a following in Canada, with their [[Barenaked Ladies (EP)|self-titled 1991 cassette]] becoming the first independent release certified gold in Canada. They had mainstream success in Canada after signing to  [[Reprise Records]] in 1992 with their debut album ''[[Gordon (album)|Gordon]]'' (with singles including "[[If I Had $1000000]]" and "[[Brian Wilson (song)|Brian Wilson]]"). The band's popularity eventually spread to the US with versions of "Brian Wilson" and "[[The Old Apartment]]" from their 1996 live album, ''[[Rock Spectacle]]'', followed by their 1998 fourth studio album ''[[Stunt (album)|Stunt]]''. The album contained their highest-charting hit, "[[One Week (song)|One Week]]", along with "[[It's All Been Done]]" and "[[Call and Answer]]".<ref name="Inc.1999">{{cite magazine |author=Powell, Bettsy |title=There's no place like home |magazine=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58 |date=16 January 1999 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |pages=and 58 |issn=0006-2510 |access-date=December 19, 2016 |archive-date=April 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424014435/https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58 |url-status=live }}</ref> Their fifth album, ''[[Maroon (Barenaked Ladies album)|Maroon]]'' (and lead single "[[Pinch Me]]"), also charted well. The band is also known for creating and performing the theme song of the American sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''. The band has continued to regularly tour and record new music, having released 14 primary studio albums of original material and three themed studio albums.

Initially a duo of singer-guitarists [[Ed Robertson]] and [[Steven Page]],<ref name="MMMBio">{{Cite AV media |people=Bill Welychka (executive producer) |title=MuchMoreMusic Bio |medium=TV-series |publisher=[[MuchMoreMusic]] |location=Toronto, Ontario |date=2003}}</ref> the band grew to a quintet by 1990, adding brothers [[Jim Creeggan|Jim]] and [[Andy Creeggan]] on bass and keyboards/congas, respectively, and drummer [[Tyler Stewart]]. Andy Creeggan left the band in 1995, and was replaced by multi-instrumentalist [[Kevin Hearn]]. Page left in 2009, reducing the group to a quartet.

The band's style has evolved, and its music (originally acoustic) grew to encompass a mixture of pop, rock and folk.<ref name="Leahey">{{Cite web |last=Leahey |first=Andrew |title=Barenaked Ladies Biography |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/barenaked-ladies-mn0000139089#biography |access-date=2025-02-18 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Peoples |first=Glenn |date=2024-03-08 |title=Barenaked Ladies' Ed Robertson Reveals the Band's Secret to Success |url=https://www.billboard.com/media/podcasts/barenaked-ladies-ed-robertson-bands-secret-to-success-behind-the-setlist-podcast-1235627753/ |access-date=2025-02-18 |magazine=Billboard |language=en-US}}</ref> Their live performances feature comedic banter and [[Freestyle rap|freestyle rapping]] between songs.<ref name="Behind the Music">{{Cite AV media |people=Moll, George (executive producer) |title=[[Behind the Music]] |medium=TV-series |publisher=[[VH1]] |location=New York, NY |date=2000}}</ref> They have received a number of [[Juno Awards]], and have been nominated for two [[Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/barenaked-ladies|title=Barenaked Ladies|date=November 19, 2019|website=Grammy.com|access-date=November 29, 2019|archive-date=October 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201007213857/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/barenaked-ladies/15786|url-status=live}}</ref> The group has sold over 15 million albums and singles, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] in March 2018.

Barenaked Ladies began as a duo of Ed Robertson and Steven Page.<ref name="MMMBio" /><ref name="Leahey" /> Both attended [[Churchill Heights Public School]] and met after a [[Peter Gabriel]] concert; they were counsellors at Interprovincial Music Camp in [[McKellar, Ontario]].<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus">{{Cite AV media |title=The Barenaked Truth (bonus interviews) |date=2004 |medium=DVD |publisher=Take 3 Productions/Casablanca Media Television |people=[[Jim Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn]], [[Steven Page]], [[Ed Robertson]], [[Tyler Stewart]]}}</ref> Page was impressed by Robertson's harmonizing when they began playing songs together.<ref name="Barenaked Truth">{{Cite AV media | people = [[Jim Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn]], [[Steven Page]], [[Ed Robertson]], [[Tyler Stewart]] | title = The Barenaked Truth | medium = Television documentary/DVD | publisher = Take 3 Productions/Casablanca Media Television | date = 2004 }}
</ref> While attending a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at [[Exhibition Stadium]], they decided on the name "Barenaked Ladies."<ref name="Talk to the Hand">{{Cite AV media |title=[[Talk to the Hand: Live in Michigan|Talk to the Hand]] ("behind the scenes" feature) |date=2007 |medium=DVD |publisher=Morningstar Entertainment/Desperation Records |people=[[Jim Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn]], [[Steven Page]], [[Ed Robertson]], [[Tyler Stewart]]}}</ref><ref name="Distinguished Artists">{{Cite AV media | people = [[Ed Robertson|Robertson, Ed]] & Frohman, Lorne (Interviewer/Host) | title = Distinguished Artists | medium = TV-series | publisher = Humber College School of Media Studies | location = Toronto, Ontario, Canada | date = 2005 }}</ref>

They first performed a largely-improvised set during a [[battle of the bands]] at [[Nathan Phillips Square]] for the [[Second Harvest Toronto|Second Harvest]] [[food bank]] on 1 October 1988.<ref name="Star89">{{cite news | title=We finally get date with Barenaked Ladies | last = Potter | first = Mitch | newspaper = [[Toronto Star]] | date= November 24, 1989}} "But they finally managed a first-ever rehearsal the morning of Oct. 1, 1988, about ''five hours'' before making a stage debut at a Nathan Phillips Square benefit concert."</ref> The duo opened for [[the Razorbacks]] and others, developing their improvised set to include comedy, songs, and audience interactions.<ref name="Behind the Music" /><ref name="Talk to the Hand" /><ref name="Distinguished Artists" />

Page and Robertson continued performing, and began writing songs together. Their first tape, ''[[Barenaked Ladies demo tapes#Buck Naked|Buck Naked]]'' (1989), was made with a four-track recorder<ref name="Barenaked Truth" /> in basements and bedrooms. They became followers of the comedy group [[Corky and the Juice Pigs]], whom they credited with exposing them to a comedic stage presence. Page and Robertson presented the group with their tape, and were invited to open for the Juice Pigs on their national tour.<ref name="Distinguished Artists" /> Page and Robertson invited two friends from music camp, brothers [[Andy Creeggan]] (percussion) and [[Jim Creeggan]] (bass),<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus" /> to play with them at a 1989 Toronto Christmas show. With the Creeggan brothers, [[Barenaked Ladies demo tapes#Barenaked Lunch|''Barenaked Lunch'' (also known as ''The Pink Tape'')]] was released in 1990.<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus" />

Andy Creeggan left for a student-exchange trip to South America six months later, leaving the band without a percussionist. They met drummer [[Tyler Stewart]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario]] in the summer of 1990, and he joined the band.<ref name="Behind the Music" /> The band received attention during Andy Creeggan's absence, receiving the 1990 [[YTV Achievement Awards|YTV Achievement Award]] for Best Band/Musical Group<ref name="Barenaked Truth" /><ref name="RPM22Dec1990">{{cite news |title=YTV Achievement Awards recognize young talent |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/CANADA/RPM/90s/1990/RPM-1990-12-22.pdf |access-date=11 October 2022 |issue=6 |publisher=RPM |date=22 December 1990 |volume=53 |page=7}}</ref> and squeezing into a ''[[Speakers Corner (TV series)|Speaker's Corner]]'' video booth to perform "[[Be My Yoko Ono]]".<ref name="Barenaked Truth" /> Andy Creeggan returned in early 1991, playing keyboards, [[congas]] and other percussion instruments, and the band soon began their first Canadian tour.<ref name="Behind the Music" />

===Early Canadian success (1991–1992)===
Their first commercial release was 1991's ''[[The Yellow Tape]]''. A demo tape created for [[South by Southwest]], it was the first recording with all five members<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus" /> and was turned down by every Canadian record label.<ref name="Distinguished Artists" /> They sold copies off the stage; people began asking for the tape at local stores, and it was released commercially.<ref name="Distinguished Artists" /> Sales increased due to word of mouth and the band's live shows.<ref name="Behind the Music" /> Page's father, Victor, founded the independent label Page Publications to manufacture and distribute the cassette.<ref>{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Paul|title=Barenaked Ladies: Public Stunts, Private Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTRuJKlUoHcC&pg=PP1|date=October 2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-3835-9}}</ref>

The band received radio airplay with a live cover of [[Dean Friedman]]'s "McDonald's Girl", which included a rap break incorporating lyrics from the [[Beastie Boys]]' "[[Hey Ladies]]".<ref>"Goofiness is its own reward for boys from the 'burbs". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', August 10, 1991.</ref> Barenaked Ladies contributed a cover of [[Bruce Cockburn]]'s "[[Lovers in a Dangerous Time]]" to the Cockburn tribute album ''[[Kick at the Darkness]]'' in November 1991, and it was the band's first Top 40 hit in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id%3Db5392b2e-b0c7-4143-a013-4645a0600fc6%26k%3D24078 |title=Barenaked Ladies feel 'a bit of anxiety' |access-date=2007-11-17 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206013841/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/vancouver/story.html?id=b5392b2e-b0c7-4143-a013-4645a0600fc6&k=24078 |archive-date=December 6, 2007 }}</ref>

[[File:TylerStewart2.jpg|thumb|alt=Tyler Stewart onstage, holding a microphone|Tyler Stewart in 2005]]
The band was removed from the lineup of the 1991 New Year's Eve concert in [[Nathan Phillips Square]] outside [[Toronto City Hall]] because a staffer for Mayor [[June Rowlands]] believed that its name objectified women,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-mayor-says-sorry-to-miss-universe-1.550549 | title=Toronto mayor says 'sorry' to Miss Universe | publisher=CBC News | date=July 20, 2005 | access-date=August 12, 2014 | archive-date=August 16, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816012719/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-mayor-says-sorry-to-miss-universe-1.550549 | url-status=live }}</ref> a decision affirmed by city councillor [[Chris Korwin-Kuczynski]].<ref name=newrules>"Barenaked Ladies ban prompts new city rules". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 25, 1992.</ref> The group booked another show at [[McMaster University]].<ref name="Barenaked Truth bonus" /> By February 1992, ''The Yellow Tape'' outsold [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'', [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' ''[[We Can't Dance]]'', and [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' at some downtown Toronto record stores.<ref>"Ladies don't have record deal yet".

''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 1, 1992.</ref> and the tape was the first [[indie rock|indie]] release to go [[music recording certification|platinum]] in Canada, selling 100,000 copies.<ref name="Behind the Music" />

By the end of February, the [[Toronto City Council]] revised its rules for event bookings at Nathan Phillips Square.<ref name=newrules /> The City Hall story has followed the band, with Robertson crediting it to a slow news week.<ref name="Behind the Music" /><ref name="Barenaked Truth" /><ref name="Distinguished Artists" />

===First albums (1992–1997)===
[[File:Andrew creeggan.jpg|thumb|alt=A bespectacled Andy Creegan, playing a keyboard at a library|Andy Creeggan performing with the Brothers Creeggan in [[London, Ontario]], in 2002]]
Barenaked Ladies were signed to [[Sire Records]] in April 1992.<ref>"Barenaked Ladies sign U.S. deal". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', April 30, 1992.</ref> They performed at Toronto's [[Ontario Place Forum]] the following month, and were the quickest act to sell out the venue.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RPM-IDX/IDX/90s/RPM-1992-07-11-OCR-Page-0007.pdf|title=Barenaked Ladies play Kingswood in August|magazine=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|access-date=July 11, 2024}}</ref>

The band's first full album, ''[[Gordon (album)|Gordon]]'', was released in July 1992 and was successful in Canada;<ref name="MMMBio" /> by the end of August, it had been certified platinum.<ref>"The Ladies and Gordon". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', August 27, 1992.</ref> The album included some of the band's best-known songs, including "[[Enid (Barenaked Ladies song)|Enid]]", the first single; "[[Be My Yoko Ono]]", which helped fund the album; "[[If I Had $1000000]]", spawning a practice of throwing [[Kraft Dinner]] during live shows which the band later discouraged;<ref name="Talk to the Hand" /><ref name="Distinguished Artists" /> and "[[Brian Wilson (song)|Brian Wilson]]", named after [[Beach Boys|Beach Boy]] [[Brian Wilson]] (who covered the song on [[Live at the Roxy Theatre|a live album]]). A number of ''Gordon''{{'s}} songs were live favourites, and had already been recorded. Although the band was doing well in Canada, US success was elusive.<ref name="Behind the Music" />

Their second album, ''[[Maybe You Should Drive]]'' (1994),<ref name="MMMBio" /> was less popular in Canada.<ref name="Behind the Music" /> The band's US tour lost money, despite an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Before the next release, Andy Creeggan decided to leave the band; he had become disillusioned with its direction,<ref name="Barenaked Truth" /> and was uncomfortable with their new fame.<ref name="MMMBio" /> According to Page, Creeggan had considered leaving during rehearsals for ''Drive''; the band convinced him to stay to record that album and for its subsequent tour. Creeggan wanted to study music at [[McGill University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/32/13/kaleidoscope|title=Kaleidoscope|website=Mcgill.ca|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=April 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418163316/http://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/32/13/kaleidoscope/|url-status=live}}</ref> Tyler Stewart has suggested that Creeggan had never fully accepted his replacement as a percussionist.<ref name="Behind the Music" /> He left when band members were tiring of one other, with Page and Robertson rarely communicating; Stewart cites Creeggan's departure as worsening the situation. Page developed alcohol abuse and depression.<ref name="Behind the Music" /><ref name="Barenaked Truth" /> To reverse their fortunes, they signed with [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]] and [[Nettwerk]] for management.<ref name="Barenaked Truth" />

The band released ''[[Born on a Pirate Ship]]'' as a quartet in 1996.<ref name = "Barelaked Nadies" /> The album's "[[Shoe Box]]" was included on the ''[[Friends]]'' soundtrack,<ref name = "Barelaked Nadies" /> and the [[Jason Priestley]]-directed video for "[[The Old Apartment]]" received notable US airplay.<ref name = "Barelaked Nadies" /> Although the album had better sales than ''Maybe You Should Drive'', it did not match the success of "Gordon".<ref name="MMMBio" /> Barenaked Ladies appeared on an episode of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' ("Spring Breakdown") performed "The Old Apartment", "Life, In a Nutshell", and "Brian Wilson" at the Peach Pit After Dark night club. Tyler Stewart invited his friend [[Kevin Hearn]] to replace Andy Creeggan as a keyboardist for the tour, and Hearn joined the band full time. They had a cameo appearance in the Canadian film ''[[The Wrong Guy]]'' with [[Dave Foley]] in 1997, performing "Gangster Girl".<ref name="Behind the Music" /><ref name="Barenaked Truth" />

Barenaked Ladies recorded two dates on their 1996 ''Born on a Pirate Ship'' tour and released ''[[Rock Spectacle]]'', a live album with a modest American radio hit in "Brian Wilson". The album was their first US gold record, and they saw their next one as a chance to make it big in the States.<ref name="Behind the Music" /><ref name="Barenaked Truth" />

===<span class="anchor" id="Breakthrough success in the United States (1998–2004)"></span>US success (1998–2004) ===
''[[Stunt (album)|Stunt]]'' (1998) was the band's greatest mainstream success; its single, "[[One Week (song)|One Week]]", spent (coincidentally) one week atop the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''Stunt'' reached number three on the US [[Billboard 200|'' Billboard'' 200]] and number nine in Canada. Kevin Hearn was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] shortly after the album was released. He received bone marrow transplants from his brother and missed most of the ''Stunt'' tour.

[[File:KevinHearn2.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|alt=A smiling Kevin Hearn|Kevin Hearn in 2005]]
The band toured with friends [[Chris Brown (Canadian musician)|Chris Brown]] and [[Greg Kurstin]] filling in on keyboards until Hearn recovered enough to rejoin them on tour. The singles "[[It's All Been Done]]" (the opening theme of the animated television series ''[[Baby Blues (American TV series)|Baby Blues]]'') and "[[Call and Answer]]" (which appeared in the film ''[[EdTV]]'') were modest hits. The band was asked to contribute a song ("[[Get in Line]]") to the soundtrack of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated series ''[[King of the Hill]].''<ref name="Barelaked Nadies">{{Cite AV media | people = [[Jim Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn]], [[Steven Page]], [[Ed Robertson]], [[Tyler Stewart]] [[Andy Creeggan]] | title = [[Barelaked Nadies]] (DVD Commentary) | medium = DVD | publisher = Warner Bros.

Led by the single "Pinch Me", ''[[Maroon (Barenaked Ladies album)|Maroon]]'' (2000)<ref name="MMMBio" /> reached number five on the ''Billboard'' Top 100 and topped the Canadian charts. A compilation album, ''[[Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits (1991–2001)]]'', was released in 2001.<ref name="MMMBio" /> After finishing a tour on 31 December 2001 in [[Rosemont, Illinois]] to promote the compilation, the band decided to take a year off (with a performance at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]' Medals Plaza) before returning to the studio in April 2003.

''[[Everything to Everyone (album)|Everything to Everyone]]'' was released on 21 October of that year,<ref name="MMMBio" /> coinciding with the start of their Peep Show tour.<ref>{{cite web |title=Barenaked Ladies on tour Peep Show |url=https://guestpectacular.com/artists/barenaked-ladies/events/tour/peep-show |website=guestpectacular.com |publisher=Guestpectacular |access-date=20 March 2022 |archive-date=26 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220326235525/https://guestpectacular.com/artists/barenaked-ladies/events/tour/peep-show |url-status=live }}</ref> The album's first single was "[[Another Postcard]] (Chimps)", which received some radio play. "Testing 1,2,3", the second single, had a video but no CD single; "[[Celebrity (Barenaked Ladies song)|Celebrity]]" was released in the UK with a CD single, but no video. "Maybe Katie" and an edited version of "For You", from a concert in [[Glasgow]], were released as [[Promotional recording#Single|radio singles]]. The album, their weakest seller in years, fulfilled their contract with [[Reprise Records]]. The group was independent for the first time since 1992, although they retained a distribution relationship with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. On its early-2004 Everywhere For Everyone tour, the band began offering live shows and subsequent studio releases for purchase as a download or CD-R on its website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bnlmusic.com/store |title=BNL :: Barenaked Ladies Official Website |access-date=2007-12-09 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213091104/http://www.bnlmusic.com/store/ |archive-date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref>

The band's next album was ''[[Barenaked for the Holidays]]'', released on 5 October 2004. It was their first independent record since ''The Yellow Tape'' and the first album recorded at Fresh Baked Woods, Page's recently-completed farmhouse studio.

The band released ''[[Snacktime!]]'', an album of original material for children, on 6 May 2008.

Robertson said about the departure of one of the band's founding members,
{{Blockquote|Our relationship with Steve Page was great and very fruitful. It lasted almost 20 years, but it was time to move on. Now we're doing something that feels really fresh and exciting to me.

==Innovation and technology==<!-- This title is linked to. If you change the section title, please change the links-->
Barenaked Ladies has often attempted to use new technology to promote themselves and their music. They were early adopters of computers for promotion when they released an "Interactive Press Kit" on a 3.5-inch [[floppy disk]] for ''Maybe You Should Drive'' in 1994, for which they received a [[MuchMusic Video Award]]. They used their website to allow fans to choose between two songs ("Be My Yoko Ono" and "Alternative Girlfriend") for inclusion on their greatest-hits CD ''[[Disc One]]''; both were ultimately included.

The band participated in ''[[City Sonic]]'', an interactive documentary series, in 2009. The series, with 20 Toronto artists, included Tyler Stewart reminiscing about the Ultrasound Showbar. The films were accompanied by an [[iPhone]] application which used [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) technology to unlock more videos when the user was near a specific location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citysonic.tv/films/Barenaked-Ladies-at-Ultrasound-Showbar.php |title=citysonic.tv |website=Citysonic.tv |access-date=2011-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104210212/http://www.citysonic.tv/films/Barenaked-Ladies-at-Ultrasound-Showbar.php |archive-date=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

They are proponents of environmentalism, following Page's passion for [[greening]]; he is a board member of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF Canada]]). The group began bringing an "[[eco-village]]" organized by the [[Reverb (non-profit)|Reverb]] organization on their 2004 Au Naturale tour. They have partnered with Reverb to form the "Barenaked Planet" project, the group's name for their project to "green" their touring. Efforts include ensuring that backstage materials are recycled, using [[biodiesel]] in their tour vehicles ([[Biodiesel#Blends|B20]] in December 2006), and [[carbon offsets and credits|offsetting carbon emissions]] with wind power. This includes band-sponsored offsets for their emissions and volunteers selling "Barenaked Planet" stickers to concertgoers, with the proceeds offsetting emissions at venues.<ref name="GillDec28">{{Cite AV media

Barenaked Ladies is the first Canadian band to receive its own ice-cream flavour, "If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours", following in the footsteps of other band-themed Ben & Jerry's flavours such as Cherry Garcia ([[Jerry Garcia]]), One Sweet Whirled and Magic Brownies ([[Dave Matthews Band]]) and Phish Food ([[Phish]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2009/12/c2115.html |title=newswire.ca |website=Newswire.ca |date=May 2, 2011 |access-date=2011-06-06| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110609190558/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2009/12/c2115.html| archive-date= June 9, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="CAice">{{cite web|last=Marcus |first=Bianca |url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/69662/ice-cream-heals-bnl-wounds |title=chartattack.com |website=Chartattack.com |date=May 12, 2009 |access-date=2011-06-06 |url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826153041/http://www.chartattack.com/news/69662/ice-cream-heals-bnl-wounds |archive-date=August 26, 2010 }}</ref> The ice cream consisted of "chocolate and vanilla ice cream with chunks of chocolate-covered toffee, white chocolate, peanut butter cups and chocolate-covered almonds."<ref name="CAice"></ref> Tyler Stewart described it as "an amalgamation of flavours [...] kind of like the band in a lot of ways—a lot of different personalities, different ethnic groups, all represented and rolled into one."<ref name="CAice"></ref>

==Side projects==
Tyler Stewart, Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn, and Ed Robertson have had side projects during time off from Barenaked Ladies. Stewart was part of the short-lived Don't Talk Dance, which released a self-titled album in 1995 [[Chris Brown (Canadian musician)|Chris Brown]] (who sat in for Hearn with Barenaked Ladies during his late-1990s cancer treatment). The album's profits went to Casey House, a Canadian AIDS charity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bnlweb.tripod.com/tyler.htm|title=Tyler Stewart|website=Bnlweb.tripod.com|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615111738/http://bnlweb.tripod.com/tyler.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Stewart plays occasionally with the rockabilly band Pogo Rodeo, which he joined in high school. The band reunited in the early 2010s, and has played occasional concerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.ovc.uoguelph.ca/post/46261040504/ovc-surgeons-passion-for-cycling-music-making-a|title=OVC surgeon's passion for cycling, music making a difference for kids with cancer|website=Bulletin.ovc.uoguelph.ca|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074711/http://bulletin.ovc.uoguelph.ca/post/46261040504/ovc-surgeons-passion-for-cycling-music-making-a|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jim Creeggan formed the alternative/jazz group [[the Brothers Creeggan]], with brother and former Barenaked Ladies member Andy Creeggan and Ian McLauchlan (who died in 2009).<ref name="BrosCreeg">{{cite web|url=http://www.brotherscreeggan.com|title=Brothers Creeggan|website=Brotherscreeggan.com|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418082919/http://www.brotherscreeggan.com/|archive-date=April 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The group, as a duo and a trio, recorded four albums between 1995 and 2002. It stopped performing regularly in the mid-2000s, and have only played together rarely (such as for Barenaked Ladies cruises). Andy Creeggan has several solo albums, with the most recent released in 2021.<ref name="BrosCreeg" />

Since 1995, Kevin Hearn has released four albums as the frontman of [[Kevin Hearn and Thin Buckle]] and three others solo (with members of Thin Buckle and other musicians). Hearn's albums are a mix of alternative rock and jazz, with other eclectic influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kevinhearn.com|title=Kevin Hearn|website=Kevinhearn.com|access-date=April 17, 2017|archive-date=December 13, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213180153/http://www.kevinhearn.com/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Reception==
In December 2008, [[Paul McCartney]] was reportedly asked by a session musician which bands he enjoyed in the current music scene. His response was "Barenaked Ladies": "Their harmonies are right on. They could outsing us any day of the week. I don't think [[John Lennon|John]] and myself ever had the sort of range they do." McCartney added that he would not mind recording with the band in the future.<ref name="http://ianundercover.com/2008/12/13/iuc-paul-mccartney-says-barenaked-ladies-sing-much-better-than-fab-four/">{{cite web |url=http://ianundercover.com/2008/12/13/iuc-paul-mccartney-says-barenaked-ladies-sing-much-better-than-fab-four |title=IUC Exclusive: Paul McCartney says Barenaked Ladies sing Much better than Fab Four; Would Consider Joining Them |website=Ianundercover.com |access-date=2009-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525162258/http://ianundercover.com/2008/12/13/iuc-paul-mccartney-says-barenaked-ladies-sing-much-better-than-fab-four |archive-date=May 25, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2018, Ontario musical historians Liam Coholan, Patrick Murphy, and Jon "The Don" Dilario said in ''Canadian Music History'': "BNL was one of the most impactful bands when it comes to discussing the development of Canadian society in the 21st century."<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Canadian Music History Issue #412 | journal=Canadian Music History | id={{ProQuest|1772089760}}}}</ref>
