Joel was born in [[the Bronx]] in New York City and grew up in [[Hicksville, New York|Hicksville]] on [[Long Island]], where he began taking piano lessons at his mother's insistence. After dropping out of high school to pursue a music career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[the Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and embarking on a solo career with his debut album, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]'' (1971). In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of "[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]" became popular in [[Philadelphia]], prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company, through which he released his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'' (1973). After ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' (1974) and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' (1976), Joel achieved his critical and commercial breakthrough with ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'' (1977). It became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning the hit singles "[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]", "[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]", "[[Only the Good Die Young]]", and "[[She's Always a Woman]]", as well as the concert staples "[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]" and "[[Vienna (Billy Joel song)|Vienna]]".

Joel's ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'' (1978) was his first album to reach No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'' (1980) was an attempt to further establish himself as a rock artist; it featured "[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]), "[[You May Be Right]]", "[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]", and "[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]". ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'' (1982) stemmed from a desire to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' (1983) served as an homage to genres of music that Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; it featured "[[Tell Her About It]]", "[[Uptown Girl]]", and "[[The Longest Time]]", three of his best-known songs. After ''[[River of Dreams]]'' (1993), Joel largely retired from producing studio material, although he went on to release ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'' (2001), featuring classical compositions composed by him and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] [[animated film]] ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', performing the song "Why Should I Worry?", and contributed to the soundtracks to several films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'' (1983), ''[[Ruthless People]]'' (1986), ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992), and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]'' (1992).<ref>{{cite news |last=Takiff |first=Jonathan |date=September 22, 1992 |title=When movies get note-worthy |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/184484369/ |url-access=subscription |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |page=33 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> Joel returned to composing new music with the 2024 single "[[Turn the Lights Back On]]".

Joel has had a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe. In 1987, he became one of the first artists to hold a rock tour in the [[Soviet Union]].

The popular songs "[[She's Got a Way]]" and "[[Everybody Loves You Now]]" were first released on this album, but went largely unnoticed until live versions were included on ''[[Songs in the Attic]] ''(1981). Columbia released a remastered version of ''Cold Spring Harbor'' in 1983, with certain songs shortened or re-orchestrated.<ref name=AllMusic-ColdSpringHarbor />

Joel began his ''Cold Spring Harbor'' tour in the fall of 1971, touring with his band, consisting of [[Rhys Clark]] on drums, Al Hertzberg on guitar, and [[Larry Russell (bassist)|Larry Russell]] on bass guitar, throughout the mainland United States and Puerto Rico, opening for such artists as [[the J. Geils Band]], [[the Beach Boys]], [[Badfinger]] and [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]]. Joel's performance at the Puerto Rican [[Mar y Sol Pop Festival]] was especially well-received; and although recorded, Joel refused to have it published on the Mar Y Sol compilation album ''[[Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival (album)|Mar Y Sol: The First International Puerto Rico Pop Festival]]''. Nevertheless, interest in his music grew.{{sfnp|Bordowitz|2005}}

Although now signed to Columbia, Joel was still obliged to pay Archie Ripp and Michael Lang a share of his royalties from album sales. In 1981, when his contract was renegotiated, the company agreed to cover these payments iself. President of [[CBS]]/Columbia Records [[Walter Yetnikoff]] also bought the publishing rights to Joel's songs owned by Ripp,{{sfnp|Bego|2007|p=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoelbiograp00bego/page/178/mode/1up 178]}} which he then gave to the artist as a birthday gift.

[[File:Billy Joel "Piano Man" 1973 press photo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A 1973 promotional photo of Joel for ''Piano Man'']]
Joel's first album with Columbia was ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'' (1973). Despite modest sales, the album's title track became his signature song, ending nearly every concert. That same year, Joel's touring band changed. Guitarist Al Hertzberg was replaced by Don Evans, and bassist Larry Russell by Patrick McDonald, himself replaced in late 1974 by [[Doug Stegmeyer]],{{cn|date=September 2025}} who stayed with Joel until 1989.{{sfnp|Smith|2007|p=[https://archive.org/details/igotoextremesbil0000smit/mode/1up 106]}} Rhys Clark returned as drummer and Tom Whitehorse as banjoist and pedal steel player; [[Johnny Almond]] joined as saxophonist and keyboardist. The band toured the U.S. and Canada extensively, appearing on popular music shows. Joel's songwriting began attracting more attention; in 1974, [[Helen Reddy]] recorded the ''Piano Man'' track "[[You're My Home (song)|You're My Home]]".

===1974–1977: ''Streetlife Serenade'' and ''Turnstiles''===
In 1974, Joel recorded his second Columbia album in Los Angeles, ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]''. His manager at the time was Jon Troy, an old friend from New York's [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood; Troy was soon replaced by Joel's wife Elizabeth.{{sfnp|Schruers|2014|p=104}} ''Streetlife Serenade'' contains references to [[suburbia]] and the [[inner city]]. It is perhaps best known for "[[The Entertainer (Billy Joel song)|The Entertainer]]", a No. 34 hit in the U.S. Upset that "Piano Man" had been significantly cut for radio play, Joel wrote "The Entertainer" as a sarcastic response: "If you're gonna have a hit, you gotta make it fit, so they cut it down to 3:05." Although ''Streetlife Serenade'' was viewed unfavorably by critics,<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: J|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=J&bk=70|access-date=February 27, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com|archive-date=May 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200525101409/https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=J&bk=70|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=December 5, 1974 |issue=175 |first=Stephen |last=Holden |author-link=Stephen Holden |title=Billy Joel ''Streetlife Serenade'' > Album Review |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/streetlife-serenade-19741205 |url-status=live |access-date=November 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503104018/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/billyjoel/albums/album/200781/review/5942638/streetlife_serenade |archive-date=May 3, 2008 }}</ref> it contains the notable songs "Los Angelenos" and "[[Root Beer Rag]]", an [[instrumental]] that was a staple of his live set in the 1970s.

In late 1975, Joel played piano and organ on several tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album.

Not long after the release of ''Streetlife Serenade'', Joel began working on his next album, ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'', at [[Caribou Ranch]] studio in [[Colorado]]. The difficult project began with [[Michael Stewart (musician)|Michael Stewart]] as producer, then [[James William Guercio]] took over before Stewart was brought in again. Using members of [[Elton John]]'s backing band [[Dee Murray]] and [[Nigel Olsson]], as well as [[session musician]]s, half the songs had been recorded when Joel decided the results were less than satisfactory. Also disenchanted with Los Angeles, where he encountered anti-New York sentiment, he returned to the East Coast [[metropolis]] in 1975, seeking inspiration in the [[History of New York City (1946–1977)#1970s|city's troubles]].{{sfnp|Bego|2007|p=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoelbiograp00bego/page/78/mode/1up 78–79]}}{{sfnp|Bordowitz|2005|p=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoellifetim00bord/page/80/mode/1up 80]}} Now with himself as producer, he rerecorded and completed the album, which when released in 1976, was the first to feature his [[Billy Joel Band|regular touring band]].{{sfnp|Schruers|2014|pp=119–120}}

"[[Say Goodbye to Hollywood]]" was a minor hit, covered by [[Ronnie Spector]] and Nigel Olsson. During a 2008 radio interview, Joel said that he no longer performs the song because singing it in its high original key "shreds" his [[vocal cords]]; however, Joel did finally play it live for the first time since 1982 when he sang it at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in May 2014. Although never released as a single, "[[New York State of Mind]]" became one of Joel's best-known songs; [[Barbra Streisand]] recorded a cover and [[Tony Bennett]] performed it as a duet with Joel on ''[[Playing with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues]]''. Other notable songs from the album include "[[Summer, Highland Falls]]"; "[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]" and "[[Prelude/Angry Young Man]]", a concert mainstay.

===1977–1979: ''The Stranger'' and ''52nd Street'' ===
[[File:Billy Joel, Lehigh Epitome 1978 page 125.jpg|thumb|right|Joel performing in December 1977]]

During the ''Turnstiles'' tour, Joel's wife Elizabeth phoned [[George Martin]] in an attempt to recruit him as the producer for Joel's next album, but having seen the artist play live at [[Rowan University|Glassboro State College]] in [[New Jersey]], Martin declined the invitation. Prior to the tour, Joel had expressed to his wife a desire to work with [[Phil Ramone]] at some point. She now contacted the legendary producer, who attended Joel's concert at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] on June 2, 1977 (as did [[Don DeVito]] from Columbia Records, who brought with him a recording truck to tape the show). Impressed by what he saw, Ramone went on to produce all seven studio albums Joel recorded from 1977 to 1986.{{sfnp|Smith|2007|p=[https://archive.org/details/igotoextremesbil0000smit/page/148/mode/1up 148–149]}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ramone |first1=Phil |author-link1=Phil Ramone |last2=Granata |first2=Charles L. |date=2007 |title=Making Records: The Scenes Behind the Music |location=New York |publisher=Hyperion |isbn=978-0786868599 |pages=71–73}}</ref>

[[File:Billy Joel "52nd Street" (1978 Columbia publicity photo) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|A 1978 promotional photo of Joel for ''52nd Street'']]
Joel released ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'' in 1978, naming it after Manhattan's [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]], which, at the time of its release, served as the world headquarters of [[CBS Records International|CBS/]] [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. The album sold over seven million copies, propelled to number one on the charts by the hits "[[My Life (Billy Joel song)|My Life]]" (No. 3), "[[Big Shot (song)|Big Shot]]" (No. 14) and "[[Honesty (Billy Joel song)|Honesty]]" (No. 24). A cover of "My Life" by Gary Bennett became the theme for the television sitcom ''[[Bosom Buddies]]''. ''52nd Street'' also won Grammy awards for [[Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male]] and Album of the Year.

In 1978, Joel gave his first of what would go on to be at least 150 shows at New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]]. In 2025, Joel described playing at the arena as being a "dream come true".<ref name=joelmsg>{{cite news|url=https://people.com/billy-joel-calls-playing-madison-square-garden-a-dream-come-true-in-documentary-11777182|title=Billy Joel Calls Playing Madison Square Garden a 'Dream Come True' in Part 2 of Documentary (Exclusive)|first=Lizzie|last=Hyman|publisher=People|date=July 24, 2025|access-date=July 27, 2025}}</ref> He currently dominates the record for most concerts performed at Madison Square Garden.<ref name=msgrecord>{{cite web|url=https://www.msgentertainment.com/the-greatest-arena-run-of-all-time-to-come-to-an-end/|title=The Greatest Arena Run of All Time to Come to an End|publisher=Madison Square Garden Entertainment|date=June 1, 2023|access-date=July 27, 2025}}</ref>

In 1979, Joel traveled to [[Havana|Havana, Cuba]], to participate in the historic [[Havana Jam]] festival from March 2–4, alongside [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Stephen Stills]], the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Billy Swan]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], Mike Finnegan, [[Weather Report]], and an array of Cuban artists including [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Tata Güines]] and [[Orquesta Aragón]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://storage.people.com/people/archive/jpgs/19790319/19790319-750-35.jpg |title=article on Havana Jam |work=People |date=March 19, 1979 |access-date=September 11, 2012 |archive-date=November 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120205041/http://storage.people.com/people/archive/jpgs/19790319/19790319-750-35.jpg |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Christine |date=March 6, 1979 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/627816455/ |url-access=subscription |title=Havana Jamming: Joel Finds Crowd Ready to Rock |newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]] |volume=69 |issue=96 |page=4B |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Although Joel's performance was for many the highlight of the weekend,<ref>{{cite news |last=Rockwell |first=John |author-link=John Rockwell |date=March 6, 1979 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/06/archives/pop-billy-joel-brings-cuban-crowd-to-its-feet.html |url-access=subscription |title=Pop: Billy Joel Brings Cuban Crowd to Its Feet |newspaper=The New York Times |volume=128 |issue=44148 |page=C11 |access-date=August 27, 2025}}</ref> CBS were unable to record or film it as planned because his wife objected to the fact that a specific deal had not been agreed with them in advance.{{sfnp|Schruers|2014|pp=146–148}} He was interviewed about his experience of playing at the event for Ernesto Juan Castellanos's documentary ''Havana Jam '79''.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

===1979–1983: ''Glass Houses'' and ''The Nylon Curtain''===
The success of his piano-driven ballads like "Just the Way You Are", "She's Always a Woman" and "Honesty" led some critics to label Joel a "[[ballad]]eer" and "[[soft rock]]er". He thought these labels were unfair and insulting, and with ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'', Joel tried to record an album that proved that he could rock harder than his critics gave him credit for, occasionally imitating and referring to the style of [[New wave music|new wave]] rock music that was starting to become popular.{{cn|date=August 2025}} Joel stated that the album cover, which pictured him wearing a leather jacket and about to throw a rock at a window of his [[Long Island]] home, was intended as a riposte to his image as a "mellow balladeer".{{sfnp|Smith|2007|p=[https://archive.org/details/igotoextremesbil0000smit/page/171/mode/1up 171]}}

''Glass Houses'' spent six weeks at the top of the ''Billboard'' album chart,{{sfnp|Bordowitz|2005|p=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoellifetim00bord/page/128/mode/1up 128]}} yielding the hits "[[You May Be Right]]" (No. 7, May 1980), "[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]", (No. 1, July 1980), "[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]" (No. 19, September 1980) and "[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]" (No. 36, November 1980).{{cn|date=August 2025}} The latter song gave its name to a 15-minute promotional film featuring both music and dialog, which as Joel's first venture of this kind, he wrote and directed himself.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=December 20, 1980 |title=Joel Movie Promo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT51 |magazine=Billboard |volume=92 |number=51 |location=Los Angeles |page=52 |via=Google Books}}</ref> "It's Still Rock and Roll to Me" was his first number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]],{{sfnp|Bordowitz|2005|p=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoellifetim00bord/page/127/mode/1up 127]}} where it spent 11 weeks in the top 10 and became the ninth biggest-selling single of the year.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=December 20, 1980 |title=Number One Awards – Pop Singles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT63 |department=Talent in Action Year End Charts |magazine=Billboard |volume=92 |number=51 |location=Los Angeles |page=TA-10 |via=Google Books}}</ref> His five sold-out shows at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1980 earned him the venue's [[Madison Square Garden Gold Ticket Award|Gold Ticket Award]] for selling more than 100,000 tickets.<ref name="BJ Kozak">{{cite magazine |last=Kozak |first=Roman |date=August 9, 1980 |title=Singer Alters Summer Tour: Double LP Set For November? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PAPA4 |magazine=Billboard |volume=92 |number=32 |location=Los Angeles |page=35 |via=Google books}}</ref><ref name="BJ Melhuish">{{cite news |last=Melhuish |first=Martin |title=The Pringle Column |agency=[[Sun Media]] |newspaper=The Interior News |location=Smithers, British Columbia |date=September 10, 1980 |page=b7 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/30084182/the_interior_news/ |via=Newspapers.com |access-date=March 30, 2019 |archive-date=March 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330205924/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/30084182/the_interior_news/ |url-status=live }}{{free access}}</ref>

''Glass Houses'' won the 1981 Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male.{{sfnp|Bordowitz|2005|p=135}} It also won the [[American Music Award]] for Favorite Album, Pop/Rock category. The album's closing song, "Through the Long Night" ([[B-side]] of the "It's Still Rock & Roll to Me" single), was a lullaby that featured Joel harmonizing with himself in a song he says was inspired by [[the Beatles]]' "[[Yes It Is]]".{{cn|date=August 2025}} In a recorded [[master class]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], Joel recalled that he had written to the Beatles asking them how to get started in the music industry. In response, he received a pamphlet about Beatles merchandise. This later led to the idea of Joel conducting Q&A sessions around the world answering questions that people had about the music industry.<ref>{{cite AV media |last=Joel |first=Billy |date=October 6, 2001 <!--Earliest broadcast date found by search on Newspapers.com (August 2025)--> |title=Billy Joel: In His Own Words |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwV-vs0B-Sc |publisher=[[A&E (TV network)|A&E Network]] |via=[[YouTube]]}} (Original broadcast split into 12 parts).</ref>

Joel's next release, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', was composed of live performances of lesser-known songs from the beginning of his career. It was recorded at larger US arenas and in intimate nightclub shows in June and July 1980. This release introduced many fans, who discovered Joel when ''The Stranger'' became a smash in 1977, to many of his earlier compositions.{{sfnp|Smith|2007|pp=[https://archive.org/details/igotoextremesbil0000smit/page/176/mode/1up 176–178]}} The album reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' chart and produced two hit singles: "Say Goodbye to Hollywood" (No. 17), and "She's Got a Way" (No. 23). It sold over three million copies. Although not as successful as some of his previous albums, it was still considered a success by Joel.{{sfnp|Bordowitz|2005}}

The next wave of Joel's career commenced with the recording of ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]''. With it, Joel became more ambitious with his songwriting, which included highly topical songs like "[[Allentown (song)|Allentown]]" and "[[Goodnight Saigon]]". Joel has stated that he wanted the album to communicate his feelings about [[the American Dream]] and how changes in American politics during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] meant that "all of a sudden you weren't going to be able to inherit [the kind of life] your old man had."<ref name="ncvideo">{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc4U8uWTRU  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/Pqc4U8uWTRU| archive-date=December 11, 2021 |url-status=live|title=Billy Joel on The Nylon Curtain – from The Complete Albums Collection |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He also tried to be more ambitious in his use of the recording studio. Joel said that he wanted to "create a sonic masterpiece" on ''The Nylon Curtain''. So he spent more time in the studio, crafting the sound of the album, than he had on any previous album.<ref name="ncvideo" /> Production of ''The Nylon Curtain'' began in the fall of 1981, but was delayed for several months after Joel was involved in a serious motorcycle accident on April 15, 1982. The bone in his left thumb was crushed and his other wrist dislocated in the incident, when he hit and was flipped over a car which had run a red light at an intersection on Long Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|title=35 Years Ago: Billy Joel Injures Both Hands in Motorcycle Accident|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|date=April 15, 2017 |access-date=July 14, 2017|archive-date=July 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701011826/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-joel-motorcycle-accident/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Seate">{{cite magazine |last=Seate |first=Mike |date=April 2010 |title=The Ballad of Billy Joel |magazine=[[Motorcyclist (magazine)|Motorcyclist]] |issue=1357 |location=El Segundo, CA |issn=0027-2205 |pages=84–89}}</ref>

In October 1982, Joel embarked on a [[The Nylon Curtain Tour|brief tour]] to support the album,<ref>{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Tom |date=October 26, 1982 |title=Billy Joel gives his all during Salt Lake stop |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/613541228/ |url-access=subscription |newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |volume=226 |issue=12 |page=B8 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> and recorded his first video special, ''Live from Long Island'', at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]] on December 29.

''The Nylon Curtain'' went to No. 7 on the charts, partially due to heavy airplay on MTV for the videos to the singles "Allentown" and "[[Pressure (Billy Joel song)|Pressure]]", both directed by [[Russell Mulcahy]].

===1983–1988: ''An Innocent Man'' and ''The Bridge'' ===
Joel's next album moved away from the serious themes of ''The Nylon Curtain'' and struck a much lighter tone. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' was Joel's tribute to [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[doo wop]] music of the 1950s and 1960s and resulted in Joel's second ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number-one hit, "[[Tell Her About It]]", which was the first single off the album in the summer of 1983. The album itself reached No. 4 on the charts and No. 2 in UK. It also boasted six top-30 singles, the most of any album in Joel's catalog. The album was well received by critics, with [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], senior editor for AllMusic, describing Joel as being "in top form as a craftsman throughout the record, effortlessly spinning out infectious, memorable melodies in a variety of styles."<ref>{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |title=An Innocent Man – Billy Joel : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=September 12, 2012 |archive-date=August 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828050638/http://www.allmusic.com/album/an-innocent-man-mw0000190510 |url-status=live }}</ref>

At the time that the album was released, [[WCBS-FM]] began playing "[[Uptown Girl]]" both in regular rotation and on the ''Doo Wop Live''.<ref>Billy Joel's Interview on Howard Stern. 2011.{{which|date=October 2012}}</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=September 2025}} The song became a worldwide hit when released as a single. Originally entitled "Uptown Girls", it was inspired by a chance encounter with [[Christie Brinkley]], [[Whitney Houston]], and [[Elle Macpherson]], who were on a modelling assignment in the [[Caribbean]] when they approached Joel whilst he was playing the piano in the bar of their hotel (where he was a holiday guest).{{sfnp|Bego|2007|pp=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoelbiograp00bego/page/197/mode/1up 197–198]}}<ref name="Heatley">{{cite book |last1=Heatley |first1=Michael |author-link1=Michael Heatley |last2=Hopkinson |first2=Frank |date=2011 |title=The Girl in the Song: The Real Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics |url=https://archive.org/details/girlinsongtruest0000heat/page/138/mode/1up |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Chicago Review Press]] |pages=138–141 |isbn=978-1569765302}}</ref> The accompanying music video featured Brinkley as a high-society girl who pulls her [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] into the gas station where Joel's character is working. At the end of the video, Joel's "grease monkey" character drives off with his "uptown girl" on the back of a motorcycle.{{sfnp|Bego|2007|p=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoelbiograp00bego/page/211/mode/1up 211–212]}} When Brinkley went to visit Joel after being asked to star in the video, the first thing Joel said to her upon opening his door was "I don't dance". Brinkley had to walk him through the basic steps he does in the video. Their work together on this video shoot sparked a relationship between the two which led to their marriage in 1985.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

In December, [[An Innocent Man (song)|the title song]] was released as a single and it peaked at No. 10 in the U.S. and No. 8 in the UK, early in 1984. That March, "[[The Longest Time]]" was released as a single, peaking at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That summer, "[[Leave a Tender Moment Alone]]" was released and it hit No. 27 while "[[Keeping the Faith (song)|Keeping the Faith]]" peaked at No. 18 in January 1985.{{cn|date=August 2025}} In the video for "Keeping the Faith", Brinkley appears as a passenger in a [[convertible]] [[Chevrolet]].{{sfnp|Bego|2007|p=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoelbiograp00bego/page/212/mode/1up 212]}} ''An Innocent Man'' was also nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy, but lost to [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''.

[[File:USA For Africa 1985 (US Press Kit 001).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Joel (second row, second from left) with other musicians for the recording of "[[We Are the World]]", January 1985]]

Joel participated in the USA for Africa "[[We Are the World]]" project in 1985. Following ''An Innocent Man'', Joel was asked about releasing an album of his most successful singles. This was not the first time this topic had come up, but Joel had initially considered [[greatest hits album]]s as marking the end of one's career. This time he agreed, and ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)|Greatest Hits Vol. 1 and 2]]'' was released as a four-sided album and two-CD set, with the songs in the order in which they were released. The new songs "[[You're Only Human (Second Wind)]]" and "[[The Night Is Still Young (Billy Joel song)|The Night Is Still Young]]" were recorded and released as singles to support the album; both reached the top 40, peaking at No. 9 and No. 34, respectively. ''Greatest Hits'' was highly successful and it has since been certified [[Diamond album|double diamond]] by the [[RIAA]], with over 11.5 million copies (23 million units) sold. It is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in American music history]], according to the RIAA.

Coinciding with the ''Greatest Hits'' album release, Joel released a two-volume ''Video Album'' that was a compilation of the promotional videos he had recorded from 1977 to that time. Along with videos for the new singles off the ''Greatest Hits'' album, Joel also recorded a video for his first hit, "Piano Man", for this project.

Joel's next album, ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]'' (1986), did not achieve the level of success of his previous albums, but it yielded the hits "[[A&nbsp;Matter of Trust]]" and "[[Modern Woman]]" (both No. 10) from the film ''[[Ruthless People]]'', a dark comedy from the directors of ''[[Airplane!]]''. The ballad "[[This Is the Time (Billy Joel song)|This is the Time]]" also charted, peaking at No. 18. On November 18, 1986, an extended version of "[[Big Man on Mulberry Street]]" was used on a Season&nbsp;3 episode of ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''.''The Bridge'' was Joel's last album to carry the Family Productions logo, after which he severed his ties with Artie Ripp. Joel was unsatisfied with most of the songs on ''The Bridge'', but his record company denied a request for time to produce better material.{{sfnp|Schruers|2014|pp=182–183}} In a 2008 interview, he described it as "not a good album'.<ref name="Neal">{{cite magazine|last=Neal |first=Chris |date=July–August 2008 |title=Stranger in Paradise |url=https://performingsongwriter.com/articles-interviews/cover-artist-interviews/billy-joel/ |url-access=subscription |format=PDF |magazine=Performing Songwriter |issue=111 |location=Nashville, TN |pages=57–62 |issn=1068-9664}}</ref>

In October 1986, Joel and his team started planning a trip to the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/24artsextra-joel.html |title=At Garden, Billy Joel Is Out to Prove He's in Control |first=Laura |last=Sinagra |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 18, 2014 |date=January 24, 2006 |archive-date=May 9, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240509161449/https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/24/arts/extra/at-garden-billy-joel-is-out-to-prove-hes-in-control.html |url-status=live }}</ref> This was realised the following July, when he arrived in the country with his wife, daughter Alexa, and full touring band. Following an improvised performance in [[Tbilisi]], Joel gave six concerts at indoor arenas in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], to a combined audience possibly in excess of 100,000 people.{{sfnp|Schruers|2014|pp=186–187}}<ref name="Brown">{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Nicholas Alexander |editor-last1=Dunkel |editor-first1=Mario |editor-last2=Nitzsche |editor-first2=Sina A. |date=2018 |chapter=Becoming a Blue-Collar Musical Diplomat: Billy Joel and Bridging the US-Soviet Divide in 1987 |title=Popular Music and Public Diplomacy: Transnational and Transdisciplinary Perspectives |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/1004723/page/175/mode/1up |url=https://archive.org/details/1004723/ |location=transcript Verlag |publisher=Bielefeld |pages=175–196 |isbn=978-3837643589 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref> The entourage was filmed for television and video to offset the cost of the trip, and the concerts were simulcast on radio around the world.

Most of that audience took a long while to warm up to Joel's energetic show, something that had never happened in other countries he had performed in. According to Joel, each time the fans were hit with the bright lights, anybody who seemed to be enjoying themselves froze. In addition, people who were "overreacting" were removed by security.<ref name=SeattelWeekly>{{cite web |title=Letters to the Editor |date=November 14, 2007 |url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-11-14/news/letters-to-the-editor.php?page=full |newspaper=[[Seattle Weekly]] |access-date=December 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117165213/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-11-14/news/letters-to-the-editor.php?page=full |archive-date=January 17, 2008}}</ref> During this concert, Joel, enraged by the bright lights, flipped his electric piano and snapped a microphone stand while continuing to sing.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-07-27-mn-4135-story.html |title=Billy Joel Blows His Cool, Upsets Piano in Moscow |agency=Associated Press |date=July 27, 1987 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=June 3, 2013 |archive-date=December 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206022907/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-27/news/mn-4135_1_billy-joel |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="MM">{{cite web| url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/bjxq74/30-years-ago-billy-joel-had-a-meltdown-in-moscow| title=30 Years Ago, Billy Joel Had a Meltdown in Moscow| last=Ozzi| first=Dan| date=July 27, 2017| magazine=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]| language=en-US| access-date=May 6, 2019| archive-date=May 6, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506231555/https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/bjxq74/30-years-ago-billy-joel-had-a-meltdown-in-moscow| url-status=live}}</ref> Joel later apologized for the incident.<ref name="MM" />

The concerts in Russia came after an intensive series of European shows and after doing interviews during the day, Joel found himself playing at venues where the [[Public address system|PA&nbsp;system]] was "second rate at best".{{sfnp|Schruers|2014|pp=186–187}} Released against his wishes in October 1987, ''[[Kontsert|КОНЦЕРТ]]'' (Russian for "Concert"), a live [[double album]] recorded during the tour,, included cover versions of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin]]" and "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]" by the Beatles. The latter was released as a single but failed to make the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, and the album was Joel's first since ''Cold Spring Harbor'' not to achieve gold disc status.{{sfnp|Bego|2007|p=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoelbiograp00bego/page/236/mode/1up 236]}}{{sfnp|Bordowitz|2005|p=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoellifetim00bord/page/161/mode/1up 161]}} Singer Pete Hewlett was brought in to hit the high notes on his most vocally challenging songs, like "An Innocent Man". It has been estimated that Joel lost more than US$1&nbsp;million of his own money on the trip and concerts, but he has said the goodwill he was shown there was well worth it.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

===1988–1993: ''Storm Front'' and ''River of Dreams'' ===
The animated film ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' (1988) features Joel in a rare [[voice acting]] role as Dodger, a sarcastic [[Jack Russell Terrier|Jack Russell]] based on [[Dickens]]'s [[Artful Dodger]]. The character's design is based on Joel's image at the time, including his trademark Wayfarer sunglasses. Joel also sang his character's song "Why Should I Worry?".

The recording of ''[[Storm Front (album)|Storm Front]]'', which commenced in 1988, coincided with major changes in Joel's career and inaugurated a period of serious upheaval in his business affairs. In August 1989, just before the album was released, Joel dismissed his manager (and former brother-in-law) Frank Weber after an audit revealed major discrepancies in Weber's accounting. Joel subsequently sued Weber for US$90 million, claiming fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, and in January 1990, Joel was awarded US$2 million in a partial judgment against Weber; in April, the court dismissed a US$30 million countersuit filed by Weber.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/joel.html |title=Billy Joel |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=February 4, 2007 |access-date=August 19, 2011 |archive-date=September 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918190851/http://classicbands.com/joel.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first single for the album, "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]", was released in September 1989 and it became Joel's third—and most recent—US number-one hit, spending two weeks at the top. ''Storm Front'' was released in October, and it eventually became Joel's first number-one album since ''Glass Houses'', nine years earlier. ''Storm Front'' was Joel's first album since ''Turnstiles'' to be recorded without Phil Ramone as producer. For this album, he wanted a new sound, and worked with [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]] of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]. Joel is also credited as one of the keyboard players on Jones's 1988 self-titled solo album, and is featured in the official video for Jones's single "Just Wanna Hold"; Joel can be seen playing the piano while his then-wife Christie Brinkley joins him and kisses him. Joel also revamped his backing band, dismissing everyone but drummer [[Liberty DeVitto]], guitarist David Brown, and saxophone player [[Mark Rivera]], and bringing in new faces, including multi-instrumentalist [[Crystal Taliefero]].

''Storm Front''{{'s}} second single, "[[I Go to Extremes]]" reached No. 6 in early 1990. The album was also notable for its song "[[Leningrad (song)|Leningrad]]", written after Joel met a clown in the Soviet city of that name during his tour in 1987, and "[[The Downeaster Alexa]]", written to underscore the plight of fishermen on Long Island who are barely able to make ends meet. Another well-known single from the album is the ballad "[[And So It Goes]]" (No. 37 in late 1990). The song was originally written in 1983, around the time Joel was writing songs for ''An Innocent Man''; but "And So It Goes" did not fit that album's retro theme, so it was held back until ''Storm Front''. Joel said in a 1996 master class session in Pittsburgh that ''Storm Front'' was a turbulent album and that "And So It Goes", as the last song on the album, portrayed the calm and tranquility that often follows a violent thunderstorm.

In September 1992, Joel filed a US$90 million lawsuit against his former lawyer Allen Grubman, alleging a wide range of offenses including fraud, breach of fiduciary responsibility, malpractice and breach of contract.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fabrikant |first=Geraldine |date=September 24, 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |title=Billy Joel takes his lawyers to court |newspaper=The New York Times |volume=142 |issue=49099 |pages=D1, D5 |access-date=August 19, 2011 |archive-date=November 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128114750/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/24/business/billy-joel-takes-his-lawyers-to-court.html |url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfnp|Soocher|1999|p=[https://archive.org/details/theyfoughtlawroc0000sooc/page/36/mode/1up 36–37]}} The case was settled out of court in the fall of 1993 for US$3 million paid to Joel by third party [[Sony Corporation of America|Sony America]], to protect its subsidiary [[Sony Music]]'s interests, as it had several other artists also using Grubman's law firm.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fabrikant |first=Geraldine |date=May 3, 1995 |title=A Tangled Tale of a Suit, A Lawyer and Billy Joeln |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/03/business/the-media-business-a-tangled-tale-of-a-suit-a-lawyer-and-billy-joel.html |newspaper=The New York Times |volume=144 |issue=50050 |page=D5 |access-date=April 17, 2024 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140103105348/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/03/business/the-media-business-a-tangled-tale-of-a-suit-a-lawyer-and-billy-joel.html |archive-date=January 3, 2014}}</ref>{{sfnp|Soocher|1999|p=[https://archive.org/details/theyfoughtlawroc0000sooc/page/39/mode/1up 39–40]}}

In 1992, Joel inducted the R&B duo [[Sam & Dave]] into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Morse |first=Steve |date=January 16, 1992 |title=Rock awards have some singing the blues |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/439615266/ |url-access=subscription |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |volume=241 |issue=16 |pages=29, 33 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> That year, Joel also started work on ''[[River of Dreams]]'', finishing the album in early 1993. Its cover art was a colorful painting by [[Christie Brinkley]] that was a series of scenes from each of the songs on the album. The [[The River of Dreams|eponymous first single]] was the last top 10 hit Joel has penned to date, reaching No. 3 on ''Billboard''{{'s}} Hot 100 and ranking at No. 21 on the 1993 year-end chart. In addition to the title track, the album includes the hits "[[All About Soul]]" (with [[Color Me Badd]] on backing vocals) and "[[Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)]]", written for his daughter, [[Alexa Ray Joel|Alexa]]. A radio remix version of "All About Soul" can be found on ''[[The Essential Billy Joel]]'' (2001), and a demo version appears on ''My Lives'' (2005).

The song "The Great Wall of China" was written about his ex-manager Frank Weber and was a regular in the setlist for Joel's 2006 tour. "2000 Years" was prominent in the millennium concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], December 31, 1999, and "Famous Last Words" closed the book on Joel's pop songwriting for more than a decade.

Joel's ''[[Greatest Hits Volume III (Billy Joel album)|Greatest Hits Volume III]]'' yielded "[[To Make You Feel My Love]]" (a [[Bob Dylan]] cover) and "[[Hey Girl (Freddie Scott song)|Hey Girl]]". During his [[Central Park]] concert in 1997, Joel performed with [[Garth Brooks]], who had reached No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'s}} country charts in 1991 with a recording of the song "[[Shameless (Billy Joel song)|Shameless]]" from Joel's 1989 album.  On March 15, 1999, Joel was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by [[Ray Charles]]. In his speech, Charles mentioned "[[Baby Grand]]", the duet Joel had written for the them which appeared on his 1986 album ''[[The Bridge (Billy Joel album)|The Bridge]]''.{{sfnp|Schruers|2024|pp=241–243}}

On October 4, 1997, two classical piano pieces composed by Joel, "The Soliloquy" and "Reverie", were first heard in public.

On December 31, 1999, Joel performed at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. At the time, Joel said that it would be his last tour and possibly his last concert. Two of his performances from that night, "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]" and "[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]" were filmed and featured that night as part of ABC's special New Year's Y2K coverage. The concert (dubbed The Night of the 2000 Years) ran for close to four hours and was later released as ''[[2000 Years: The Millennium Concert]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |date=April 29, 2000 |title=Live Billy Joel On Columbia 2-CD Set |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EA8EAAAAMBAJ/page/n5/mode/1up |magazine=Billboard |volume=112 |issue=18 |location=New York |pages=5,95 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

In 2001, Joel released ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'', a collection of classical piano pieces composed by Joel and performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel often uses bits of these pieces as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]''. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed "New York State of Mind" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with "[[Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)]]", at [[the Concert for New York City]] in Madison Square Garden. That night, he also performed "[[Your Song]]" with Elton John.{{cn|date=September 2025}}

In 2003, Joel inducted [[The Righteous Brothers]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that his song "[[Until the Night]]" from the album ''52nd Street'' was a tribute to the duo.

In 2005, Columbia released a box set, ''[[My Lives]]'', which is largely a compilation of demos, b-sides, live/alternative versions, and even a few Top 40 hits. The compilation also includes the software that permits people to remix "Zanzibar" and a live version of "I Go to Extremes" with their PC. A DVD of a show from the ''River of Dreams'' tour is included.

On January 7, 2006, Joel began a tour across the U.S. Having not released any new songs in 13 years, he featured a sampling of songs from throughout his career, including major hits as well as deep cuts like "Zanzibar" and "[[All for Leyna]]".<ref>{{cite news |last=Gamboa |first=Glenn |date=January 9, 2006 |title=Piano man rallies after a curious twist |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/710224926/ |url-access=subscription |newspaper=Newsday |volume=66 |issue=128 |location=Melville, NY |page=A10 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Between January 23 and April 24, his 12 performances at Madison Square Garden broke the venue's record for the most consecutive sold-out concerts by an artist during the same tour (the previous best was 10 shows, set by [[Bruce Springsteen]] in 2000).

Joel visited the United Kingdom and Ireland for the first time in many years as part of the European leg of his 2006 tour. On July 31, 2006, Joel performed a free concert in [[Rome]], with the [[Colosseum]] as the backdrop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/joel-and-adams-in-free-rome-concert-270269.html|title=Joel and Adams in free Rome concert|date=August 1, 2006|work=Irish Examiner|access-date=January 28, 2017|archive-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202055650/http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/joel-and-adams-in-free-rome-concert-270269.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Having worked on an [[oyster]] dredger as a teenager, Joel has a longstanding interest in nautical matters. In 2009, it was reported that he owned a small flotilla of vessels, overseen by a full-time captain. Several of the craft were based on rough designs by Joel, including a {{convert|57|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} boat with a top speed of {{convert|50|mph|km/h|1|abbr=on}} which he had built to commute from Oyster Bay to [[Manhattan]].<ref name="Knapp">{{cite magazine |last=Knapp |first=Lisa Hoogerwerf |date=July 2009 |title=Rock the Boat: Billy Joel |url=https://archive.org/details/Yachts_International_2009-07_08/page/n46/mode/1up |magazine=Yachts International |volume=13 |issue=3 |location=Fort Lauderdale, FL |pages=48–50 |issn=1095-1091 |via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

===Health issues===
In 1970, a career decline and personal tragedies led Joel to a [[Major depressive episode|deep depressive period]]. It was revealed in the 2025 documentary ''[[Billy Joel: And So It Goes]]'' that he tried to commit suicide twice.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web |last1=Sarner |first1=Lauren |title=Billy Joel attempted suicide twice after affair with friend's wife |url=https://nypost.com/2025/06/06/entertainment/billy-joel-attempted-suicide-twice-after-affair-with-friends-wife/ |date=6 June 2025}}</ref> After Joel's affair with Elizabeth Weber Small resulted in the breakup of Attila, and his estrangement from his best friend Jon Small, Joel was evicted from Small's house.<ref name="auto">{{cite magazine |last1=Kreps |first1=Daniel |title=Billy Joel Reveals Suicide Attempts Following Affair With Best Friend's Wife in New Doc |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/billy-joel-suicide-attempts-affair-best-friends-wife-doc-1235357797/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=6 June 2025}}</ref> "I had no place to live.

When he awoke, Joel was disappointed that his attempt failed, and swore he would "do it right" the second time around.<ref name="auto"/> Joel then left a [[suicide note]] and attempted to kill himself a second time by drinking furniture polish. Joel later said, "I drank furniture polish. It looked tastier than [[bleach]]."{{sfnp|Bordowitz|2005|p=[https://archive.org/details/billyjoellifetim00bord/page/39 39]}} Jon Small rushed him to the hospital.
