==History==
===Formation and ''Ember to Inferno'' (1999–2004)===
The band formed in 1999, choosing the name "Trivium" from a Latin three-way intersection to describe their music as combining [[metalcore]], [[melodic death metal]] and [[thrash metal]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Zuurmond |first=Marcel |title=Trivium |url=http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/nl/interviews/view/id/370 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221041/http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/nl/interviews/view/id/370 |archive-date=October 21, 2017 |access-date=March 4, 2014 |website=Lords of Metal}}</ref> Singer Brad Lewter then saw Heafy performing a cover version of "[[No Leaf Clover]]" by [[Metallica]] at Heafy's eighth-grade talent show and later asked him to try out for his band as lead guitarist.<ref>{{cite book |author=Matt Heafy |title=Hellraisers: A Complete Visual History of Heavy Metal Mayhem |date=October 24, 2017 |publisher=Race Point |isbn=9781631064302 |editor=Axl Rosenberg, Christopher Krovatin |page=7 |chapter=Foreword}}</ref> The pair went over to drummer [[Travis Smith (musician)|Travis Smith]]'s house where they played a rendition of Metallica's "[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (Metallica song)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]".

In mid-2001, Trivium parted ways with its bassist.{{Who|date=March 2025}} Trivium asked Richie Brown from local black metal band [[Mindscar]] to fill in on bass duties until a full-time member could be brought in.

In an interview with ''Guitar World'', it was stated that for their next studio album, Trivium would "forgo the complex epic compositions, tricked-out leads and seven-string guitars that characterized its past two albums" and instead take an approach similar to that of ''Ascendancy'' by using uncluttered riffs, Drop C# tuning, and more straightforward solos.

Trivium's music mixes "soaring" and "crushing" [[riffs]], dual guitar harmonies, [[double bass drum]] patterns and occasional [[blast beat]]s and breakdowns typical of the metalcore genre. Vocally, Trivium combines both [[singing]] along with heavy [[screaming (music)|screaming]] and [[death growl|growls]]. Trivium has been considered one of the notable [[New wave of American heavy metal]] acts,<ref name="Blabbermouth">{{cite news |title='New Wave Of American Heavy Metal' Book Documents Over 600 Bands |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=44955 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |access-date=April 27, 2008 |archive-date=May 21, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521104002/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=44955 |url-status=live }}</ref> having been referred to as one of "big four" bands of the movement, along with [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]].<ref name="Loudwire - Big Four">{{Cite web|last=Blum|first=Jordan|title=The 'Big 4' Bands of 17 Metal Subgenres|url=https://loudwire.com/big-4-bands-metal-subgenres/|access-date=2021-12-17|website=Loudwire|date=November 19, 2021 |language=en|archive-date=September 6, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220906022346/https://loudwire.com/big-4-bands-metal-subgenres/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Their style has evolved over the years: from their earliest work on ''[[Ember to Inferno]]'' through ''[[In Waves (Trivium album)|In Waves]]'', there is a clear thrash influence from [[Metallica]] and [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], as well as a melodic death metal influence from early [[In Flames]].<ref name="MetalHammer">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/albums-of-the-decade-trivium-ascendancy/|title=Ascendancy Named as album of the decade|date=July 15, 2009|magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]|access-date=July 15, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412235749/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/albums-of-the-decade-trivium-ascendancy/|archive-date=April 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''Shogun'' has a heavy Japanese influence on its title track as well as the first single release "Kirisute Gomen", which translates to "[[Kiri sute gomen|authorization to cut and leave]]". Acknowledging Matt Heafy's Japanese heritage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrashhits.com/2008/08/album-trivium-shogun/|title=Thrashhits Review on Shogun|date=July 15, 2009|publisher=Thrash Hits|access-date=July 15, 2009|archive-date=April 15, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415164339/http://www.thrashhits.com/2008/08/album-trivium-shogun/|url-status=live}}</ref> the album also was described more favorably as more their own style, as previous references to Trivium sounding like Metallica had been made on the back of ''The Crusade''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/trivium/the-crusade.htm|title=The Crusade Review (Hetfield Reference)|date=July 15, 2009|magazine=Stylus Magazine|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> ''The Crusade'' made sparing use of [[seven-string guitar]]s, which were featured heavily on ''Shogun''.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Trivium - The Crusade (album review 9) {{!}} Sputnikmusic|url = https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/9696/Trivium-The-Crusade/|website = www.sputnikmusic.com|access-date = 2015-09-26|archive-date = September 2, 2023|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230902224417/https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/9696/Trivium-The-Crusade/|url-status = live}}</ref>

On ''In Waves'', the band featured a sound closer to ''Ascendancy'' than ''The Crusade'' and ''Shogun''. Instead of being in drop D like on ''Ascendancy'', the band went half a step lower to drop C#. The album has several songs, such as 'Built to Fall' or 'Dusk Dismantled', featuring mostly clean vocals or solely screamed vocals from Heafy. Seven-string guitars once again returned on ''[[Silence in the Snow]]'' tuned to B-flat,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trivium.org/spotifystories|title=The Story And Sound Behind Silence In The Snow|website=Trivium.org|access-date=21 October 2017|archive-date=December 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208130154/http://www.trivium.org/spotifystories|url-status=live}}</ref> and have since been used in subsequent albums along with the previously used six-string drop C# tuning, and occasionally seven-string drop G# tuning.

===Lyrical themes===
{{More citations needed|date=March 2025}}

Heafy been the primary lyricist since his early days as a member. He is known for his poetic style of lyrics and the usage of archaic words. Growing up, Heafy experienced [[anxiety]], teenage [[angst]], and occasional thoughts of [[suicide]]; several songs from the album ''Ascendancy'', such as "Rain", "Suffocating Sight", and "Departure", deal with these issues. Although not a victim himself, he also wrote the song "A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation" on the topic of [[domestic violence]] and [[child abuse]], inspired by the stories of some of his peers.

Lyrical themes on the album ''The Crusade'' includes famous killings. "Entrance of the Conflagration" is about [[Andrea Yates]]'s murder of her five children, "Unrepentant" is about Nazir Ahmad's murder of his three daughters and stepdaughter, "Contempt Breeds Contamination" is about the death of [[Amadou Diallo]], and "And Sadness Will Sear" is based upon the murder of [[Matthew Shepard]].

Many of the songs on ''Shogun'' draw lyrical inspiration from [[Greek mythology]]. "Into the Mouth of Hell We March" and "Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis" detail the story of [[Odysseus]] choosing whether to face the giant whirlpool [[Charybdis]] or the six-headed monster [[Scylla]]. "He Who Spawned the Furies" is about the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus|Cronos]] devouring his children and castrating his father [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], creating [[Aphrodite]] and the [[Erinyes|Erinýes]] (the Furies). "Of Prometheus and the Crucifix" references the daily torment of [[Prometheus]] and alludes to [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. "Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven" is written from the perspective of the [[nymph]] [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], detailing her rape and impregnation by [[Zeus]] and her transformations into a bear and into [[Ursa Major]]. Mythological lyrics returned on ''[[In the Court of the Dragon]]''. Inspired by fantasy literature, the band made up its own mythology on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://knotfest.com/culture/matt-heafy-talks-overcoming-negativity-and-the-new-trivium-album-in-the-court-of-the-dragon/|title=Matt Heafy Talks Overcoming Negativity and the New Trivium Album 'In the Court of the Dragon'|work=[[Knotfest]]|last=Delgadillo|first=Nicolás|date=September 9, 2021|accessdate=October 10, 2021|archive-date=October 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211010132552/https://knotfest.com/culture/matt-heafy-talks-overcoming-negativity-and-the-new-trivium-album-in-the-court-of-the-dragon/|url-status=live}}</ref> Lyrical content on ''[[The Sin and the Sentence]]'' and ''[[What the Dead Men Say (album)|What the Dead Men Say]]'' were inspired by modern aspects of life, such as [[social media]] and [[artificial intelligence]] as well as general themes such as [[war]], [[history]] and [[religion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2017-10-19/triviums-track-by-track-guide-to-the-sin-and-the-sentence|title=Trivium's track-by-track guide to The Sin And The Sentence|date=October 19, 2017|website=Teamrock.com|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-date=November 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108160218/http://teamrock.com/feature/2017-10-19/triviums-track-by-track-guide-to-the-sin-and-the-sentence|url-status=live}}</ref>
