'''The Pretty Reckless''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[New York City]], formed in 2009. The band consists of [[Taylor Momsen]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Ben Phillips (lead guitar, backing vocals), Mark Damon (bass), and Jamie Perkins (drums). In August 2010, the band released their debut studio album, ''[[Light Me Up]]''. The album spawned three moderately successful singles, most notably "[[Make Me Wanna Die]]". The band released the ''[[Hit Me Like a Man EP]]'' in early 2012. In March 2014, the band released their second studio album, ''[[Going to Hell]]'', which included the singles "[[Heaven Knows (The Pretty Reckless song)|Heaven Knows]]" and "[[Messed Up World (F'd Up World)]]", both of which topped the US and UK rock charts.

On October 21, 2016, [[Razor & Tie]] released the band's third studio album, ''[[Who You Selling For]]''. This album spawned the single "[[Take Me Down (The Pretty Reckless song)|Take Me Down]]", which earned the band their fourth number one on the US rock chart. On February 12, 2021, the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Death by Rock and Roll]]'', was released.  The Pretty Reckless became the first female-fronted band to have seven number-one singles when "[[Death by Rock and Roll (song)|Death by Rock and Roll]]" hit number one on the Mainstream Rock chart.

In 2012, two singles were released from the album: "You" and "My Medicine". Videos for both singles were also released: "You" featuring Momsen in a small empty apartment playing the guitar, and "My Medicine" featuring Momsen at an out-of-control party as she sings about being under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Later in 2012, she appeared in a video completely naked. In the video entitled "The Words - Under The Water", Momsen appeared in a black-and-white film while saying the lyrics like reciting a poem. By the time the video ends, Momsen appears without her clothes on, although her private parts are blurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/505753/20130913/taylor-momsen-topless-naked-photos-pretty-reckless.htm#.UkHBQj9dr1U|title='Gossip Girl' Taylor Momsen Goes Topless For Band Poster [PHOTOS&#93; - International Business Times|publisher=Au.ibtimes.com|date=September 13, 2013|access-date=February 18, 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130924165823/http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/505753/20130913/taylor-momsen-topless-naked-photos-pretty-reckless.htm%23.UkHBQj9dr1U|archive-date=September 24, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Writing for the band's third album began shortly after the completion of two years of touring in support of the band's second studio album, ''[[Going to Hell]]'' (2014). <blockquote>"We had so much we wanted to say, it was like shaking a can of soda on tour, and then when we started writing we cracked the seal", Momsen said. "The touring life is very isolating. You look at the world through a bus or airplane window. But music is the healing factor. It's the one thing that is grounding and a true companion through the forest. It saved us—again."<ref name="blabbermouth 2016" /> </blockquote>The band released "[[Take Me Down (The Pretty Reckless song)|Take Me Down]]" as the lead single for their third studio album on July 15, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|first=Chad|last=Childers|url=https://loudwire.com/the-pretty-reckless-take-me-down-single/|title=The Pretty Reckless Hit the Crossroads With 'Take Me Down' Single|work=[[Loudwire]]|date=July 15, 2016|access-date=December 28, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231112211601/https://loudwire.com/the-pretty-reckless-take-me-down-single/|archive-date=November 12, 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> It became the band's fourth single to top the Mainstream Rock chart<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Kevin|last=Rutherford|url=https://www.billboard.com/pro/the-pretty-reckless-rock-songs-record-take-me-down/|title=The Pretty Reckless Sets Mainstream Rock Songs Record With New No. 1|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 26, 2016|access-date=October 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027125445/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7556883/the-pretty-reckless-rock-songs-record-take-me-down|archive-date=October 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and was serviced to US [[active rock]] radio on July 19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/rock/future-releases|title=Rock Future Releases|work=All Access Music Group|access-date=July 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710052709/http://www.allaccess.com/rock/future-releases|archive-date=July 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The music video for "Take Me Down" was released on September 29, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/video-premiere-the-pretty-reckless-take-me-down|title=Video Premiere: The Pretty Reckless's 'Take Me Down'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 29, 2016|access-date=December 28, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002142142/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/video-premiere-the-pretty-reckless-take-me-down/|archive-date=October 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The band's third studio album, ''[[Who You Selling For]]'', was released on October 21, 2016, by [[Razor & Tie]].<ref name="blabbermouth 2016">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-pretty-reckless-to-release-who-you-selling-for-album-in-october/|title=The Pretty Reckless To Release 'Who You Selling For' Album in October|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=August 9, 2016|access-date=August 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810162613/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-pretty-reckless-to-release-who-you-selling-for-album-in-october/|archive-date=August 10, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/who-you-selling-for-mw0002979731|title=Who You Selling For – The Pretty Reckless|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 28, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225095837/https://www.allmusic.com/album/who-you-selling-for-mw0002979731|archive-date=February 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
