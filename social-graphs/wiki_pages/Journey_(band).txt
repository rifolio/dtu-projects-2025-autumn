==History==

===1973–1977: Formation, ''Journey'', ''Look into the Future'' and ''Next''===
[[File:Neal Schon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Neal Schon]], the remaining original member of Journey in 2008.]]
The original members of Journey came together in San Francisco in 1973 under the auspices of former Santana manager [[Walter Herbert (manager)|Herbie Herbert]]. Originally called the Golden Gate Rhythm Section and intended to serve as a [[Backup band|backup group]] for established [[Bay Area]] artists, the band included Santana alumni [[Neal Schon]] on lead guitar and [[Gregg Rolie]] on keyboards and lead vocals. Bassist [[Ross Valory]], formerly of both [[Frumious Bandersnatch]] and the [[Steve Miller Band]], as well as rhythm guitarist [[George Tickner]] of Frumious Bandersnatch rounded out the group. [[Prairie Prince]] of [[The Tubes]] served as drummer. After one performance in Hawaii, the band quickly abandoned the "backup group" concept and developed a distinctive [[jazz fusion]] style. After an unsuccessful radio contest to name the group, [[roadie]] John Villanueva<ref name="Journey 1983">''Journey: Frontiers and Beyond'' video, NFL Films, 1983.</ref> suggested the name "Journey".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journey-tribute.com/journey/resources/faq/faq-s2.html |title=Journey FAQ at Steve Lake's Journey Tribute Page |publisher=Journey-tribute.com |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=September 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923074215/http://www.journey-tribute.com/journey/resources/faq/faq-s2.html |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=10–11}}

The band's first public appearance came at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] on [[New Year's Eve]] 1973 to an audience of 10,000. On the following day, the band flew to Hawaii to perform at the Diamond Head Crater to an audience over 100,000 strong. Prairie Prince rejoined The Tubes shortly thereafter; on February 1, 1974, after auditioning up to 28 drummers, the band hired British drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]], who had recently worked with [[David Bowie]] and had been a member of the second iteration of [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[Mothers of Invention]]. The new line-up made its debut on February 5, 1974, at the [[Great American Music Hall]] in front of [[Columbia Records]] executives, and secured a [[recording contract]] with the label. The band went on to perform at venues around the Bay Area.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=11–13}}

Journey went into CBS Studios in November 1974 with producer Roy Halee to record its debut album, ''[[Journey (Journey album)|Journey]]''. The album was released in April 1975, entering the ''Billboard'' charts at number 138. Rhythm guitarist Tickner left the band (and the music business to study medicine) due to the amount of heavy touring the band was doing in promoting the album, allowing Schon to take on full guitar duties. The band entered the studio again in late 1975 to record ''[[Look into the Future]]'', which was released in January 1976 and entered the ''Billboard'' Top 200 charts at number 100. The band promoted the album with a two-hour performance at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, which later aired on the radio as touring continued to promote the album.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=13–15}}

From May to October 1976, the band went to His Master's Wheels Studios to record its third studio album, ''[[Next (Journey album)|Next]]'', which—like its predecessor—was produced by the band. This album had a much more commercial sound, while keeping the band's jazz fusion and progressive rock roots intact.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=17}} The album was released in February and charted on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 at number 85.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=19}} However, sales did not improve, and Columbia Records was on the verge of dropping the band.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=22–23}}

===1977–1980: New musical direction, ''Infinity'', ''Evolution'', and ''Departure''===
[[File:Steve Perry, cropped from Steve Perry & Efrim Manuel Manuck 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Steve Perry, the former lead vocalist of Journey (2019).]]
{{blockquote|I still think some of the stuff we did then was great. Some of it was self-indulgent, just jamming for ourselves, but I also think a lot of other things hurt us in the early days. It took a while for the politics to sort of shape up.<br />— Neal Schon{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=19}}}}

As Journey's album sales did not improve, Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman who would share lead vocals with Rolie.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=22–23}} The band hired [[Robert Fleischman]] and made the transition to a more popular style, akin to that of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977, opening for bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], Target, [[Judas Priest]], and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]]. Fleischman and the rest of the band began writing and rehearsing new songs, including the soon-to-be-popular track "[[Wheel in the Sky]]".{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=24–25}} During a performance before about 100,000 at Soldier Field in Chicago, the band was introduced to Steve Perry. Differences between Fleischman and manager Herbie Herbert resulted in Fleischman's departure from the band in September of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/robertfleischman.html |title=Interviews |publisher=Melodicrock.com |access-date=2011-03-01 |archive-date=2010-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127144312/http://melodicrock.com/interviews/robertfleischman.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journey-zone.com/Features/Interviews/26_01-03/RF.htm |title=Robert Fleischman interview at The Journey Zone |publisher=Journey-zone.com |date=2009-08-14 |access-date=2010-09-10 |archive-date=2010-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824202333/http://www.journey-zone.com/Features/Interviews/26_01-03/RF.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=26–27}}

Herbie Herbert, the band's manager, hired [[Roy Thomas Baker]] as producer to add a layered sound approach similar to that of Baker's previously produced band, [[Queen (band)|Queen]].{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=29}} With their new lead singer and new producer, the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Infinity (Journey album)|Infinity]]'', released in January 1978, peaked at number 21 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=31}} The band embarked on a [[Infinity Tour|tour]] in support of the album, when they performed as headliners of a full tour for the first time, beginning with their topping a bill that included [[Van Halen]] and [[Ronnie Montrose]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Mary |title=Journey Takes Off With Vocalist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVVBAAAAIBAJ&dq=journey+tour&pg=PA5&article_id=5262,993604 |access-date=2022-01-18 |publisher=Harlan Daily Enterprise |date=1978-05-24 |location=Harlan, Kentucky |language=en}}</ref>

According to the band's manager Herbie Herbert, tensions arose between a discontented Aynsley Dunbar and the band due to his displeasure with the change in musical direction from the jazz fusion sound. Neal Schon reflected on the tensions: "We would talk about it, and he'd say he'd be willing to simplify things, but we'd get out there, and after five shows, he wasn't doing that at all." Dunbar started playing erratically and talking derogatorily about the other members, which eventually  resulted in Herbert firing Dunbar shortly after the [[Infinity Tour]] ended with the [[Day on the Green]] 1978 concert at [[Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum]] on September 2nd.
Dunbar was ably replaced by [[Berklee College of Music|Berklee]]-trained  and ex-Montrose drummer [[Steve Smith (drummer)|Steve Smith]].{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=34–35}}<ref name="journey-zone1">{{cite web |url=http://www.journey-zone.com/Archive/Interviews/2003.htm#8 |title=Steve Smith interview at The Journey Zone |publisher=Journey-zone.com |access-date=2010-09-10 |archive-date=2011-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713121635/http://www.journey-zone.com/Archive/Interviews/2003.htm#8 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith, and Valory entered Cherokee Studios in late 1978 to record their fifth studio album, ''[[Evolution (Journey album)|Evolution]]'', which was released in March 1979, peaking at number 20 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The album, which was a milestone for the band, gave the band their first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] Top-20 single, "[[Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin']]", peaking at number 16, which gave the band significant airplay.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=36–38}} Following the tour in support of ''Evolution'', the band expanded its operation to include a lighting and trucking operation for their future performances, as the tour had grossed more than $5 million, making the band as popular as it had ever been in five years.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kozak |first1=Roman |title=Lighting and Trucking Areas Attract Journey |magazine=Billboard |date=1979-11-03 |page=36 |location=New York |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The band later entered Automatt Studios to record their sixth studio album, ''[[Departure (Journey album)|Departure]]'', which was released in March 1980, peaking at number eight on the ''Billboard'' 200. The first single from the album, "[[Any Way You Want It]]", peaked at number 23 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 1980.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=42; 44}}

Keyboardist Gregg Rolie left the band following the ''Departure'' tour to start a family and undertake various solo projects. It was the second time in his career he had departed from a successful act.<ref>Flans, "Journey;" [http://members.cox.net/mrcarty/page7.html Matt Carty's Herbie Herbert Interview, p. 7.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124085414/http://members.cox.net/mrcarty/page7.html |date=November 24, 2011 }}</ref> Keyboardist [[Stevie "Keys" Roseman]] was brought in to record the lone studio track, "The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love)", on the band's live album ''Captured''.<ref>''Captured'' reissue (2006) liner notes, p. 15, lines 8–9; ''Time (Cubed)'' liner notes pp. 11–14.</ref> Rolie suggested pianist [[Jonathan Cain]] of [[The Babys]] as his permanent replacement.

===1981–1983: Height of popularity, ''Escape'' and ''Frontiers''===
With Cain joining as the new keyboard player, the band entered Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California, in late 1980, releasing their seventh studio album, ''[[Escape (Journey album)|Escape]]'', in July 1981. ''Escape'' became their most successful album, charting at number one in the United States. The album had a clutch of hit singles, which included "[[Who's Crying Now]]", "Still They Ride", "[[Open Arms (Journey song)|Open Arms]]", and "[[Don't Stop Believin']]".{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=53–55}}

The band began another lengthy yet successful tour on June 12, 1981, supported by opening acts [[Billy Squier]], [[Greg Kihn Band]], [[Point Blank (band)|Point Blank]], and [[Loverboy]], and Journey opened for the Rolling Stones on September 25 in Philadelphia at [[JFK Stadium]]. [[MTV]] videotaped one of their two sold-out shows at [[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] in [[Houston]] on November 6, 1981, in front of over 20,000 fans, later released on DVD.<ref>''Journey: Live in Houston'' DVD, 1981. The band also pioneered the use of a very large video screen at live performances, allowing them to increasingly perform before stadium-sized crowds.</ref>{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=57–58; 70}}

Following the success of the 1981 tour, the band's full establishment as a corporation, and the formation of a fan club called "Journey Force", the band released "Only Solutions" and "1990s Theme" for the 1982 Disney film, ''[[Tron]]''. Schon had also made time to work with [[Jan Hammer]] on a few albums.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=58–61}} Journey continued touring in 1982 with shows in North America and Japan.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=63}}

With millions of records, hit singles, and tickets sold, the band entered Fantasy Studios again in the middle of their 1982 tour to record their eighth studio album, ''[[Frontiers (Journey album)|Frontiers]]''. Released in February 1983, the band's second-best selling album sold over six million copies, peaking at number two on the ''Billboard'' charts, and spawning the hit singles "[[Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)]]", "[[Faithfully (song)|Faithfully]]", "[[Send Her My Love]]", and "[[After the Fall (song)|After the Fall]]".{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=68}}

Journey began the ''Frontiers'' tour in Japan, and continued in North America with [[Bryan Adams]] as opening act.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=70}} During the tour, [[NFL Films]] recorded a video documentary of their life on the road, ''Frontiers and Beyond'', shooting scenes at [[JFK Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, with more than 80,000 fans in attendance.<ref name="Journey 1983"/>

===1984–1987: ''Raised on Radio'' and more personnel changes===
After the ''Frontiers'' tour, the band took some time off. Lead singer Steve Perry and guitarist Neal Schon both pursued solo projects. In 1984, Perry, with the help of Herbie Herbert, recorded and released his first solo album, ''Street Talk''. Neal Schon toured briefly in 1984 with his supergroup [[Hagar Schon Aaronson Shrieve|HSAS]], in support of their sole album, ''[[Through the Fire (Hagar Schon Aaronson Shrieve album)|Through the Fire]]'' released that year on Geffen.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=76–77}}

When asked if Journey was over because of the selling of their properties at the end of 1984, Neal Schon commented, "No way Journey's ending. We're all too committed to this band to ever let that happen. In fact, one of the reasons we decided to go off in separate directions for a while was to keep the band as strong as ever."{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=76–77}}

Following a phone call between Cain and Perry, Journey returned to Fantasy Studios in late 1985 to record their ninth studio album, ''[[Raised on Radio]]'', but with Perry taking the role as the album's producer. Tensions within the band were shown when Herbert and Perry fired both bass player Ross Valory and drummer Steve Smith for musical and professional differences a few months into the recording sessions for the album, though Valory later admitted he left the band on his own accord.<ref name="journey-zone1"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journeymusic.com/discography.html |title=Discography |publisher=Journeymusic.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203102816/http://www.journeymusic.com/discography.html |archive-date=February 3, 2008}}</ref> Bassist and future ''[[American Idol]]'' judge [[Randy Jackson]], bassist Bob Glaub, and established drummer [[Larrie Londin]] were brought in to continue the album's recordings.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=78–81}} ''Raised on Radio'' was released in May 1986, peaking at number four on ''Billboard's'' album chart, but underperforming compared to the band's previous two efforts.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=83–84}} It featured five singles: The top-10 hit "[[Be Good to Yourself]]" along with "[[Suzanne (Journey song)|Suzanne]]", "[[Girl Can't Help It (song)|Girl Can't Help It]]", "[[I'll Be Alright Without You]]", and "Why Can't This Night Go On Forever?".{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=83}}

The ''Raised on Radio'' tour began at Angels Camp in August 1986 and the band performed sold-out shows throughout the United States before concluding with two shows in Anchorage in early 1987,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kielty |first1=Martin |title=When Steve Perry Played His Last Full Show With Journey |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/last-journey-show-steve-perry/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=February 1, 2022 |language=en |date=February 1, 2017}}</ref> with selected dates supported by [[Honeymoon Suite]], [[The Outfield]], and [[Glass Tiger]].

With tensions between Perry, the band, and the band's manager Herbie Herbert at an all-time high following the tour's conclusion, Perry was unable or unwilling to remain actively involved, and was tired of touring, as it was affecting his health and his vocals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.cox.net/mrcarty/index.html |title=2001 Herbie Herbert Interview with Matt Carty, pp. 13–14 |publisher=Members.cox.net |access-date=September 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023172549/http://members.cox.net/mrcarty/index.html |archive-date=October 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/05/foolish-foolish.html |title=The Q: GQ |publisher=Men.style.com |access-date=March 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201134817/http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/05/foolish-foolish.html |archive-date=February 1, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=89}} Herbert had booked fifteen more shows for the tour, but Perry had declined, and told Schon and Cain that he was done with Journey.{{sfn|Cain|2018|pp=17–18}}

===1987–1995: Hiatus===
The band went into a hiatus in 1987 following the conclusion of their ''Raised on Radio'' tour. Columbia Records released the ''[[Greatest Hits (Journey album)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation in November 1988, which became one of the best-selling greatest-hits albums, selling over 15 million copies and continuing to sell half a million to a million copies per year. The compilation spent 750 weeks on the ''Billboard'' album charts until 2008.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=91–93}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |title=Gold & Platinum – August 3, 2009 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=August 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701162536/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |archive-date=July 1, 2007 }}</ref>

While Perry had retreated from the public eye, Schon and Cain spent the rest of 1987 collaborating with artists such as [[Jimmy Barnes]] and [[Michael Bolton]] before teaming up with Cain's ex-Babys bandmates [[John Waite]] and [[Ricky Phillips]] to form the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Bad English]]<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Ship of Dreams |magazine=Spin |date=March 2005 |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2f8puPMUSsC&dq=jonathan+cain+lead+vocals&pg=PA66 |access-date=February 9, 2023 |publisher=SPIN Media LLC |language=en |issn=0886-3032}}</ref> with drummer [[Deen Castronovo]] in 1988, releasing two albums in 1989 and 1991. Steve Smith devoted his time to his jazz bands, [[Vital Information]] and [[Steps Ahead]], and teamed up with Ross Valory and original Journey keyboardist Gregg Rolie to create [[The Storm (American band)|The Storm]] with singer [[Kevin Chalfant]] and guitarist Josh Ramos, along with Herbie Herbert as the band's manager, as he did with Journey with Scott Boorey.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=91–93}}

On November 3, 1991, Schon, Cain, and Perry reunited to perform "Faithfully" and "Lights" at the [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] tribute concert ''Laughter, Love & Music'' at Golden Gate Park, following the concert promoter's death in a helicopter accident.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=95}} In October 1993, Schon, Rolie, Valory, Dunbar, Smith, and Cain reunited and performed at a private dinner for their manager Herbie Herbert at Bimbo's in San Francisco, with Kevin Chalfant on lead vocals.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=97}}<ref name="auto2b">{{Cite web|url=https://www.melodicrock.com/articles/interviews/2014/03/12/herbie-herbert-one-mans-journey|title=Herbie Herbert: One Man's Journey|date=March 13, 2014|website=MelodicRock.com|access-date=April 22, 2020|archive-date=April 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403012708/https://www.melodicrock.com/articles/interviews/2014/03/12/herbie-herbert-one-mans-journey|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the breakup of Bad English in 1991, Schon and Castronovo formed the [[glam metal]] band [[Hardline (band)|Hardline]] with brothers [[Johnny Gioeli|Johnny and Joey Gioeli]], releasing only one studio album before his departure. Neal later joined [[Paul Rodgers]] in 1993 for live performances, alongside Deen Castronovo.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=96–97}} In 1994, Steve Perry had released his second solo album ''[[For the Love of Strange Medicine]]'', and toured North America in support of the album, though his voice had changed since the last time he had performed.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=98}}

===1995–1997: Reunion and ''Trial by Fire''===
Perry made the decision to reunite with Journey under the condition that Herbie Herbert would no longer be the band's manager. The band hired Irving Azoff, longtime [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] manager, as the new manager for the band in October 1995. Steve Smith and Ross Valory reunited with Journey and the band started writing material for their next album, with rehearsals beginning that same month.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=100}}

The band began recording their 10th studio album, ''[[Trial by Fire (Journey album)|Trial by Fire]]'', in early 1996 at The Site and Wildhorse Studio in Marin County and Ocean Way Recorders, in which they recorded under producer Kevin Shirley.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=102}} It was released in late October that year, peaking at number three on the ''Billboard ''album charts. The album's hit single "[[When You Love a Woman]]", which reached number 12 on the ''Billboard'' charts, was nominated in 1997 for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1997/grammys.htm |title=39th Annual Grammy Award Winners and Nominees for 1997 |publisher=Rock on the Net |date=February 26, 1997 |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=December 28, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228081340/http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1997/grammys.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The album also produced three top-40 [[mainstream rock]] tracks, "Message of Love" reaching number 18, "Can't Tame the Lion" reaching number 33, and "If He Should Break Your Heart" reaching number 38.<ref>Billboard.com Journey's ''Trial by Fire'' singles</ref>{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=109}}

Plans for a subsequent tour ended when Perry, troubled by pain while hiking in Hawaii on a 10-day break in August 1996, discovered he had a degenerative bone condition and could not perform without hip-replacement surgery, which for some time he declined to undergo, later admitting he had other physical issues. The accident resulted in the album's release date being delayed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51425/episode_about.jhtml |title=Behind the Music: Journey |work=Vh1 |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=April 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423134541/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51425/episode_about.jhtml |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="GQ Blog on men.style.com">{{cite web|first=Alex |last=Pappademas |url=http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/05/foolish-foolish.html |title=Foolish, Foolish Throat: A Q&A with Steve Perry |publisher=Men.style.com |date=May 29, 2008 |access-date=March 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201134817/http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/05/foolish-foolish.html |archive-date=February 1, 2009}}</ref>{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=106–107}}

The band took a break following the album's release to work on solo projects, waiting for Perry to make up his mind on if he wanted to tour. Schon released his solo album ''Electric World'' in 1997, later creating Abraxas Pool with former Journey member Gregg Rolie, drummer Michael Shrieve, and a few former Santana members. Cain released his two solo albums, ''Body Language'' and ''For A Lifetime'' in 1997 and 1998, respectively.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=110–111}}

Following the reunion album's release, the band was becoming restless waiting for an answer from Perry regarding touring. Following a phone call between Cain and Perry, the latter announced that he would be departing from Journey, releasing himself from the band's contracts and making the decision to semiretire from the music business, disappearing from the public eye again. Steve Smith later exited the band, citing that Journey would not be the same without Perry, and returning to his jazz career and his project Vital Information.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=115–117}}

The band hired drummer Deen Castronovo, Schon's and Cain's [[Bad English]] bandmate and drummer for [[Hardline (band)|Hardline]], to replace Steve Smith. After auditioning several high-profile candidates, including [[Geoff Tate]], Kevin Chalfant, and [[John West (musician)|John West]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic-rock.com/interviews/nealschon.html|title=Melodicrock Interviews: Neal Schon|publisher=melodicrock.com|access-date=September 10, 2018|archive-date=September 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910060907/http://www.melodic-rock.com/interviews/nealschon.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Journey replaced Perry with [[Steve Augeri]], formerly of [[Tyketto]] and [[Tall Stories (band)|Tall Stories]].{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=118}} The band later recorded the song "Remember Me", which was featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 film [[Armageddon (1998 film)|''Armageddon'']].{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=121}}

Following a rehearsal with Augeri and Castronovo, the band performed four gigs in Japan, a reliable touring stronghold for the band. When asked how he felt about touring for the first time in over a decade, Schon commented: "It's a little like we are reborn again." Journey embarked on a tour in the United States titled Vacation's Over, which began in October and concluded at the end of December in Reno. They continued the tour with another leg in 1999, beginning in Minnesota in June and concluding in Michigan in September.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=122–123}}

From March to August 2000, the band entered Avatar Studios to record their next studio album, ''[[Arrival (Journey album)|Arrival]]'' with producer Kevin Shirley. The album was released in Japan later in the year.  A North American release of the album followed in April 2001, peaking at number 56 on the Billboard charts. The album's single "All the Way" failed to boost sales for the album which was considered a disappointment with mixed reviews and resulted in Sony dropping the band from their label. Upon the album's completion, the band embarked on a tour in support of the album in Latin America, the United States, and Europe.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=123–126; 131}}

During the events of September 11, 2001, in response to the attacks in New York City, the band joined various other bands at a major fundraising event to help the victims and families of the attack held on October 20 and 21 at the Smirnoff Music Centre in Dallas, Texas. The event raised about $1 million.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=132–133}}

Activity for Journey was quiet in 2002, as Schon formed [[Planet Us]] with bandmate Castronovo, Sammy Hagar and former Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony until 2004, when Planet Us disbanded. Schon also co-wrote songs with the band [[Bad Company]], while Cain released another solo album. Having made some recordings between 2001 and 2002, the band released a four-track EP titled ''[[Red 13]]'' in November under their new label Journey Music, with an album cover design chosen through a fan contest with the online cover designed by Kelly McDonald, while the retail cover designed by Christopher Payne was only made available at the band's performances. The band only performed one club gig in support of the EP, but later began another tour of the United States from May to August in 2003, that included their teaming with [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[REO Speedwagon]] in Classic Rock's Main Event.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.concertarchives.org/concerts/classic-rock-s-main-event | title=Jul 27, 2003: Classic Rock's Main Event at Carolina Amphitheater Marion, SC &#124; Concert Archives }}</ref> The band then toured the following year on the Summer Detour, which began from June and concluded in September 2004. In November, Journey reteamed with both REO Speedwagon and Styx for a tour around the [[Caribbean]] aboard the ''Triumph'' cruise ship.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=133–136}}

In 2005, the members of Journey were inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] alongside former members Perry, Dunbar, Tickner, Steve Smith, and Fleischmann. Rolie was the only member who did not appear at the ceremony. Surprised to see Perry joining them to accept the induction with the band, Valory commented on the wonderful things Perry had to say in which he looked to be in fine shape, and that it was a pleasant surprise to see him.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=137–138}}

Following their accolade on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the band began recording at the Record Plant in Sausalito, California, for their 12th studio album, ''[[Generations (Journey album)|Generations]]'', with producer Kevin Elson, who had previously collaborated with the band. The album was released on August 29 in Europe, with a North American release following on October 4. The album peaked at number 170 on the ''Billboard'' charts. To promote the album and celebrate the band's 30th anniversary, the band embarked on a tour starting in Irvine, California, in June and concluding in Phoenix in October. Each concert on the tour was three hours long with an intermission and featured many of their classic hits, as well as new songs from the album.{{sfn|Daniels|2011|pp=139–146}}

In 2006, the band toured in Europe and then joined [[Def Leppard]] in a North American tour. During the tours, however, suggestions arose that Augeri was not singing, but was using backing tracks to cover up his deteriorating vocals, resulting in him getting attacked by the fans. Augeri had been suffering from vocal attrition problems before the band began the tour with Def Leppard, and Journey had been accused of using prerecorded lead vocals,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journey-zone.com/Archive/Editorials/2009.htm#06 |title=A Personal Journey Chapters Six, Seven, and Eight |publisher=Journey-zone.com |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=September 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909040146/http://www.journey-zone.com/Archive/Editorials/2009.htm#06 |url-status=live }}</ref> an accusation that former manager Herbie Herbert insists was true.<ref name="auto2b"/> Augeri admitted in a 2022 interview that he wasn't legally allowed to say whether it was true or not.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Before His First Gig With Journey, Steve Augeri Got So Nervous He Threw Up |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/journey-singer-steve-augeri-interview-1358450/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=14 January 2023 |date=6 June 2022}}</ref> In a press statement, the band later announced that Augeri had to step down as Journey's lead singer and leave the tour to recover.

With the successful tour still going on, the band was quick to hire Jeff Scott Soto from [[Talisman (band)|Talisman]] as their lead vocalist. He performed as Journey's vocalist for the first time on July 7 in Bristow. Because of its success and popularity, the tour was extended to November.

Schon later found [[Filipino people|Filipino]] singer [[Arnel Pineda]] of the cover band The Zoo, covering the song "Faithfully". Schon was so impressed that he contacted Pineda to set up two days of auditions, which went well, naming him the official lead vocalist of Journey on December 5, 2007.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/journey-finds-new-singer-the-old-fashioned-way-on-the-internet-99867/|title=Journey Finds New Singer the Old-Fashioned Way: On the Internet|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 6, 2007|access-date=October 31, 2018|archive-date=October 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031214848/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/journey-finds-new-singer-the-old-fashioned-way-on-the-internet-99867/|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Daniels|2011|p=171}}

Although Pineda was neither the first non-American to become a member of Journey (former drummer Aynsley Dunbar is British), nor even the first nonwhite member (bass player Randy Jackson is African American), his recruitment resulted in some fans of Journey making racist comments towards the new vocalist.

===2020–present: Contested lineup changes, lawsuits, and ''Freedom''===
On March 3, 2020, Schon and Cain announced that they had fired Smith and Valory and were suing them for an alleged "attempted corporate ''coup d'état,''" seeking damages in excess of $10 million. The lawsuit alleged Smith and Valory tried to "assume control of Nightmare Productions because they incorrectly believe that Nightmare Productions controls the Journey name and mark" to "hold the Journey name hostage and set themselves up with a guaranteed income stream after they stop performing." Valory and Smith contested the firings, with the support of Perry and former manager Herbie Herbert. Court filings revealed that Perry had been paid as a member of the band for years despite not performing. In an open letter dated that same day, Schon and Cain stated Smith and Valory "are no longer members of Journey, and that Schon and Cain have lost confidence in both of them and are not willing to perform with them again."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theriver107.com/2020/03/06/why-journey-are-paying-steve-perry-not-to-sing/|title=Why Journey Are Paying Steve Perry Not to Sing|publisher=WRRL.com|access-date=March 9, 2020|date=March 6, 2020|archive-date=August 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823193832/https://theriver107.com/2020/03/06/why-journey-are-paying-steve-perry-not-to-sing/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200303006138/en/|title=Miller Barondess Files Lawsuit on Behalf of Key Members of Iconic Rock Band Journey—Neal Schon and Jon Cain—Against Dissident Band Members|date=March 3, 2020|work=Business Wire|access-date=March 4, 2020|archive-date=August 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823193833/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200303006138/en/|url-status=live}}</ref> Valory countersued Schon and Cain, among other things, for their partnership's claim of owning the Journey [[trademark]] and [[service mark]] (collectively known as the mark), when that partnership, Elmo Partners, was only the licensee of the mark from 1985 to 1994, when the license was terminated by Herbie Herbert of Nightmare Productions, owners of the mark and name.
