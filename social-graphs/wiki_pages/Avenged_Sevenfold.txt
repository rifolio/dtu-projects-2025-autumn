'''Avenged Sevenfold''' (abbreviated as '''A7X''') is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Huntington Beach, California]], formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist [[M. Shadows]], rhythm guitarist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist [[Synyster Gates]], bassist Johnny Christ, and drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]].

Avenged Sevenfold are known for their diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957202/avenged-sevenfold-returns-with-nightmare-after-drummers-death|title = Avenged Sevenfold Returns with 'Nightmare' After Drummer's Death|date = July 26, 2010|access-date = November 8, 2014|magazine = Billboard|last = Harding|first = Cortney}}</ref> The band emerged with a [[metalcore]] sound on their debut album ''[[Sounding the Seventh Trumpet]]''; they largely continued this sound through their second album ''[[Waking the Fallen]]''. The band's style had evolved by their third album and first major label release, ''[[City of Evil]]'', into a more traditional heavy metal style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its [[Avenged Sevenfold (album)|self-titled release]] and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their founding drummer, [[The Rev|Jimmy "The Rev" Sullivan]], died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of [[Dream Theater]] member [[Mike Portnoy]], and released and toured in support of their fifth album ''[[Nightmare (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Nightmare]]'' in 2010, which debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], their first number one debut.<ref>{{cite magazine|url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957051/avenged-sevenfold-scores-first-no-1-album-on-billboard-200|title = Avenged Sevenfold Scores First No. 1 Album on Billboard 200|date = August 4, 2010|access-date = November 8, 2014|magazine = Billboard|last = Caulfield|first = Keith}}</ref>

In 2011, drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. The band's sixth studio album ''[[Hail to the King (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Hail to the King]]'', which was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Ilejay. It would feature a heavy metal and hard rock style, with it being written as a tribute to their influences. ''Hail to the King'' charted as number 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts. Ilejay left the band in late 2014 and was replaced by former [[Bad Religion]] drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]], but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album ''[[The Stage (album)|The Stage]]'' in October 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart in the US. ''The Stage'' is their first [[Concept album|conceptual album]] and marked another stylistic change for the band, moving towards a [[progressive metal]] sound. The band released their eighth studio album, ''[[Life Is But a Dream...]]'', a highly experimental record, in June 2023.

To date, Avenged Sevenfold have released eight studio albums, one live album/DVD, two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avengedsevenfold.com/news/brooks-wackerman-joins-avenged-sevenfold |title=Brooks Wackerman Joins Avenged Sevenfold. |publisher=Avenged Sevenfold |date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=April 27, 2016 |archive-date=September 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902012040/http://avengedsevenfold.com/news/brooks-wackerman-joins-avenged-sevenfold/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> and their records have received numerous certification awards, including five platinum album awards from their home country's institution ([[RIAA]]).

He recalled: "I was totally shocked and scared out of my mind when Synyster Gates called to let me go. I was like, ‘Oh my God – my wife is about to have a baby. How am I going to support my family now?" M. Shadows recounted the band's side of the situation to ''[[Ultimate Guitar]]'', saying: "Arin got more and more distanced as time went on. It's kind of like everyone goes through their honeymoon period and it's all great, but then you start realizing that we're four guys that have a way we do things and then there's someone else that just doesn't really fit into that at all. And as nice of a guy as he is, there were just a bunch of things that didn't represent us at all, and you can't have that, especially when we've worked for so long and so hard at what we do. And the last thing we care about is our public perception of what we should do with our lives."<ref>{{Cite web |title=A7X: Why We Fired Arin Ilejay |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/a7x_why_we_fired_arin_ilejay.html |access-date=2025-04-30 |website=www.ultimate-guitar.com |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Schaffner"/>

We wanted to be the heaviest and most melodic band at that time.”<ref name="Leiverspublished"/> In the band's DVD ''All Excess'', producer [[Andrew Murdock]] explained this transition: "When I met the band after ''Sounding the Seventh Trumpet'' had come out before they had recorded ''Waking the Fallen'', M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing'."{{Citation needed|date=April 2025}} Zacky Vengeance recalled the transition: "''Waking'' was the first time we pushed [Shadows] to sing more. I remember at the beginning of [the album cycle], he was all screaming, and one time he was, like, kind of dicking around, singing the melody instead of screaming, and we were like, ‘Dude, you have to sing that!’ And so he did, and it was incredible, you know, and then we were like, ‘OK, all right, we’re allowed to fucking sing. If you have a good voice, you don’t have to scream just to scream.'"<ref name="Leiverspublished"/>

=== Lyrical themes ===
The band's lyrics occasionally incorporate [[Bible|Biblical]] imagery. When asked if Avenged Sevenfold is a [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian band]], M. Shadows replied: "Absolutely not. I don’t believe in those things. I try not to get into that because a lot of our fans are Christians and a lot aren’t." The band's lyrics have also incorporated [[Politics|political]] themes, such as in "Critical Acclaim". In 2006, Shadows said: "Most people know we're kind of one of the only bands around right now that will admit that we're [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. When we went on the [[Warped Tour]] last year — all of those bands, they're not only anti-war, they're anti-everything our country stands for. We were like, 'fuck this.' We're going to wear our America shirts." Shadows stated the band had shifted stances slightly in 2020, saying in an open letter: "I am aware that in the past Avenged has antagonized with some of our lyrics and imagery. We have also used confederate flags in our artwork while paying tribute to artists we grew up listening to or simply trying to start controversy. I'm sure we will be called out, and rightfully so, by people reading this. No excuses. But everyone grows up at some point, and I feel grateful that we have an audience that has allowed us to evolve with them."<ref name="Schaffner"/>

Shadows said: "we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That's like telling us we aren't punk enough.

Are you gonna listen to [[Hatebreed]] or are you gonna listen to us?’ Most fucking hardcore bands want to be metal bands anyway but they just can’t play well enough."<ref name="Schaffner"/> Eli Enis of ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' assessed: "sure, if you take [[Cannibal Corpse]] with your [[Tea (meal)|afternoon tea]] then maybe the [[Orange County, California|O.C.]] band don't cut it."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Enis |first=Eli |title=10 heaviest AVENGED SEVENFOLD songs |url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/10-heaviest-avenged-sevenfold-songs/ |access-date=2025-04-22 |website=Revolver |language=en-US}}</ref>

Speaking of the band's mainstream exposure through ''[[MTV]]'' programs such as ''[[Total Request Live]]'', Zachy Vengeance said, "you have a five-and-a-half-minute song on the radio, and you have a video with a band, fucking tattoos from head to toe, No. 1 on ''TRL'' and with guitar solos and shit. [...] And we're just kind of like, the joke's on [[Popular culture|mainstream music]] at that point. Here we are, fucking metal, punks, fucking who knows what kind of band, getting attention." M. Shadows recalled, "We found out that 80 percent of the kids that bought [City of Evil] were Avenged fans, and about 20 percent of them were ''TRL'' fans, like, 'I like '[[Bat Country]].'
