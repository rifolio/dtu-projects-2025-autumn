'''Saliva''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in 1996. They have been nominated for six Grammys and have won one MTV award.

After releasing their self-titled debut album in 1997, Saliva was signed to [[Island Records]] and went on to release their second studio album ''[[Every Six Seconds]]''. They later released their third studio album titled ''[[Back into Your System]]'' in 2002, which reached No.&nbsp;19 on the [[Billboard 200]]. ''Back into Your System'' launched one of Saliva's most successful songs, "[[Always (Saliva song)|Always]]", reaching No.&nbsp;51 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No.&nbsp;1 on the Modern Rock Chart. Three years after ''[[Survival of the Sickest (album)|Survival of the Sickest]]'', Saliva released ''[[Blood Stained Love Story]]'' in 2007, repeating ''[[Back into Your System]]''{{'}}s chart performance at No.&nbsp;19 on the Billboard 200. Its first single, "[[Ladies and Gentlemen (Saliva song)|Ladies and Gentlemen]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. Their most well-known lineup, which lasted from 2000–2005, consisted of [[Josey Scott]], Wayne Swinny, Chris D'Abaldo, Dave Novotny, and Paul Crosby.

The band is known for having their songs played at sporting events, especially [[WWE]]. The band's guitarist Wayne Swinny said, "a lot of our songs, whether they were intended that way or not - most of them weren't - they just lend themselves to sporting events. You can't watch a football game or go to a football game and not hear '[[Click Click Boom]],' '[[Ladies and Gentlemen (song)|Ladies and Gentlemen]]'."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wayne Swinny of Saliva |url=https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/wayne-swinny-of-saliva}}</ref>

Saliva then released ''[[Survival of the Sickest (album)|Survival of the Sickest]]'' on August 17, 2004, which reached number 20 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. On May 29, 2005, guitarist Chris D'Abaldo announced he had left the band{{r|AMG}} "for obvious reasons, as the band is not a unit anymore." He then shortly retracted his statement and apologized, declaring on the band's website that "there was a bit of an issue we're working through and we're looking forward to recording a new album later this year".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1503377/20050602/story.jhtml|title=Saliva lose their guitarist|date=June 2, 2005|access-date=January 30, 2008|publisher=MTV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219143416/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1503377/20050602/story.jhtml|archive-date=February 19, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, the band's website later apologized again for the confusion and confirmed that due to "creative differences", D'Abaldo was in fact leaving the band, but that Saliva was "completely moving forward as planned and [has] our best music ahead of us". D'Abaldo eventually moved on to start the band Smolder. Jake Stutevoss formerly of the band [[Future Leaders of the World]] replaced him in Saliva's tour lineup. Stutevoss left the group right before the recording sessions for Ladies and Gentlemen. Jonathan Montoya, formerly of Full Devil Jacket, then became the next permanent member of Saliva.{{r|AMG}}

=== ''Cinco Diablo'', ''Greatest Hits'' and departure of Jonathan Montoya (2008–2010) ===

In an interview with [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] on February 27, Scott said "We're going to go in the studio probably around May and record our next record. If you like "Ladies and Gentlemen" and "Click Click Boom", and more dynamic stuff, it's going to be an ass-whooping of a record. It's going to be 45 minutes of ass-whooping!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/subscriptions/wwetunes/vol8/exclusives/salivaecw|title=Saliva talk about the new album|date=February 27, 2008|access-date=January 30, 2008|publisher=WWE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302040015/http://www.wwe.com/subscriptions/wwetunes/vol8/exclusives/salivaecw|archive-date=March 2, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> Saliva toured with [[Sevendust]] in [[South Korea]], [[Japan]] and a brief stint in Europe until July 2008.{{cn|date=May 2025}}

As of April 30, 2008, Octane 20 on Sirius Satellite Radio began playing a new song titled "Don't Question My Heart", featuring [[Brent Smith]] from [[Shinedown]]. The song can be found on the album ''[[WWE The Music, Vol. 8]]'', and was the official television theme song for the [[ECW on Sci Fi|ECW]] brand.

Saliva's sixth studio album is titled ''[[Cinco Diablo]]'' and was released on December 16, 2008. "Hunt You Down" was a song on the album that was then made the official [[WWE No Way Out 2009]] theme song in February 2009. Saliva also made a song titled "I Walk Alone", which is a theme song used by [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] since 2005, which has been used in ''[[Gears 5]]'' upon starting a Versus match as him as a skin of [[Marcus Fenix]] via an update.

The band worked on a reality television show style DVD following the recording of ''Cinco Diablo'' and life on the road.  In an interview with MJP, Josey was asked if it was a TV Show to which Josey stated "I hope not", and stated that he wanted it more as "a DVD for our fans".

Saliva went on tour with [[Pop Evil]], [[Since October]], Dead Season, and [[Aranda (band)|Aranda]]. They were scheduled to join the 13th annual [[SnoCore Tour]], but singer Josey Scott had ulcer surgery. [[Walt Lafty]] of [[Silvertide]] was hired to fill in for Scott for the tour, but Saliva ultimately decided to drop out of the tour, instead of touring with Lafty.

On March 23, 2010, the band released a Greatest Hits album titled, ''Moving Forward in Reverse: Greatest Hits''.<ref>"[http://tunelab.com/2010/01/14/saliva-to-release-greatest-hits-album/ Saliva To Release Greatest Hits Album] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123020716/http://tunelab.com/2010/01/14/saliva-to-release-greatest-hits-album/ |date=2010-01-23 }} ''Tunelab.com.''
