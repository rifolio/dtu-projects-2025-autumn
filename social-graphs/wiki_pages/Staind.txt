'''Staind''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|eɪ|n|d}} {{respell|STAYND}}) <!--DO NOT change to "was" unless a reliable source is provided to back up this assertion --> is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], formed in 1995. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Aaron Lewis]], lead guitarist [[Mike Mushok]], bassist and backing vocalist Johnny April, and drummer Jon Wysocki. The lineup has been stable outside of the 2011 departure of Wysocki, who was replaced by Sal Giancarelli. Staind has recorded and released eight studio albums: ''[[Tormented (Staind album)|Tormented]]'' (1996), ''[[Dysfunction (album)|Dysfunction]]'' (1999), ''[[Break the Cycle]]'' (2001), ''[[14 Shades of Grey]]'' (2003), ''[[Chapter V (Staind album)|Chapter V]]'' (2005), ''[[The Illusion of Progress]]'' (2008), ''[[Staind (album)|Staind]]'' (2011), and ''[[Confessions of the Fallen]]'' (2023). 

The band was most successful in the early 2000s, with ''Break the Cycle'' going [[RIAA certification|five times platinum]] in the United States and producing a top-five [[Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hit with its lead single "[[It's Been Awhile]]". ''Break the Cycle'', along with the band's following two full-length albums, also topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and the two after peaked within the top five. Several of their other singles also became rock and crossover hits, including "[[Fade (Staind song)|Fade]]", "[[For You (Staind song)|For You]]", "[[Price to Play]]", "[[So Far Away (Staind song)|So Far Away]]", and "[[Right Here (Staind song)|Right Here]]". The band's activity became more sporadic into the 2010s, with Lewis pursuing a solo [[country music]] career and Mushok subsequently joining the band [[Saint Asonia]].

==History==
===Early years and ''Tormented'' (1995–1998)===
In 1993, vocalist [[Aaron Lewis]] and guitarist Mike Mushok met at a Christmas party in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. Mushok introduced drummer Jon Wysocki while Lewis brought in bassist Johnny April to form the band in 1995. Their first public performance was in February 1995, playing a heavy, dark, and introspective style of metal.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Heavy Metal |last=Berelian |first=Essi |date=2005 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=9781843534150 |page=343}}</ref> Extensive touring in the Northeast helped Staind acquire a regional following over the next few years.

The band started covering [[Korn]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], and [[Alice in Chains]], among others, and played at local clubs (most commonly playing at Infinity, a live music venue located in Springfield) for a year and a half. Staind self-released their debut album, ''[[Tormented (Staind album)|Tormented]]'', in November 1996, citing Tool, [[Faith No More]], and [[Pantera]] as their influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tormented-mw0000744246|title=Tormented - Staind {{!}} Review|last=Tognazzini|first=Anthony|website=AllMusic|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> In October 1997, Staind acquired a concert slot through Aaron's cousin Justin Cantor with [[Limp Bizkit]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lamusicawards.com/act/stain/|title=Staind : Nominee – 1996 6th Annual LA Music Awards|website=Lamusicawards.com|access-date=May 30, 2024}}</ref> Just prior to the performance, Limp Bizkit frontman [[Fred Durst]] was appalled by Staind's grotesque album cover and unsuccessfully attempted to remove them from the bill.

===''Dysfunction'' (1999–2000)===
On April 13, 1999, Staind released their major label debut ''[[Dysfunction (album)|Dysfunction]]'' on [[Flip Records (1994)|Flip Records]]. The album, which was co-produced by [[Fred Durst]] and [[Terry Date]] (who also produced acts like [[Soundgarden]], [[Deftones]], and Pantera), received comparisons to [[alternative metal]] giants Tool and Korn.<ref>[http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search_advanced?kw=POPULAR+UPRISINGS+&pubList=&startDate=02%2F13%2F1999+&endDate=02%2F13%2F1999+&au=Carla+Hay&rpp=10&sb=FULL_DATE&so=1&action=Submit]{{dead link|date=September 2025|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} </ref> In particular, Aaron Lewis was lauded for his vocals, which were likened to those of [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Eddie Vedder]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Ron|title=Sound Bites: audio reviews|publisher=[[Associated Press]] (archive)|url=https://apnews.com/e0205d251575b853fd30326ea1e2a0b5?SearchText=staind|date=July 26, 1999|access-date=January 19, 2013|quote=Lead singer Aaron Lewis' vocals fuel the fire well.

The album achieved slow success, reaching the No. 1 spot on [[Billboard.com|Billboard]]'s Heatseeker Charts almost six months after its debut.<ref name=billboard>{{cite book|last=Hay|first=Carla|title=Flip's Staind Stands Tall As Proof Of Rock's Resurgence|publisher=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwgEAAAAMBAJ&q=Carla%20Hay+%22Flip%27s+Staind+Stands+Tall+As+Proof+Of+Rock%27s+Resurgence%22&pg=PA11|date=October 23, 1999|access-date=January 19, 2013}}</ref> In the same week, the record jumped to No.&nbsp;74 on Billboard's Top 200 Album Charts.<ref name=billboard/> The nine-track LP (with one hidden track, "Excess Baggage") produced three singles, "[[Just Go (Staind song)|Just Go]]", "[[Mudshovel]]", and "[[Home (Staind song)|Home]]". "Mudshovel" and "Home" both received radio play, cracking the Top 20 of Billboard's Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. In promotion of ''Dysfunction'', Staind went on several tours, including the Family Values Tour with acts like [[Limp Bizkit]] and [[The Crystal Method]], as well as opening for [[Sevendust]]'s headlining tour.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011013010909/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427694/19990921/crystal_method.jhtml Limp Bizkit Talks "Real" Lineup As Family Values Tour Kicks Off] ''MTV News''.

===''Break the Cycle'' (2001–2002)===
[[File:Staind Lewis.jpg|thumb|upright|Lewis performing at the [[Rolling Rock Town Fair]] on August 4, 2001]]

Staind toured with Limp Bizkit for the [[Family Values Tour]] during the fall of 1999, where Aaron Lewis performed an early version of "Outside" with Fred Durst at the [[Mississippi Coast Coliseum]]. Staind released their third studio album, ''[[Break the Cycle]]'', on May 22, 2001. Propelled by the success of the first single, "[[It's Been Awhile]]", the album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on Billboard's Top 200 Album charts, selling 716,000 copies in its first week.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071224090656/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1507768/20050817/staind.jhtml Staind Score Third Straight Billboard Win With Chapter V] ''MTV News''.

''Break the Cycle'' saw the band retaining the [[nu metal]] sound from their previous album. Despite this, the album saw the band going further into a [[post-grunge]] sound which is evident in the smash hit song "[[It's Been Awhile]]", and the song led critics to compare the band to several other [[post-grunge]] bands at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/blog/post/rhapsody-university-post-grunge-101 |title=University: Post-Grunge 101 |publisher=Rhapsody |date=September 1, 2014 |access-date=August 11, 2015}}</ref> The record spawned the singles "[[It's Been Awhile]]" (which hit the Billboard Top 10), "[[Fade (Staind song)|Fade]]", "[[Outside (Staind song)|Outside]]", "[[For You (Staind song)|For You]]", and the acoustic ballad "Epiphany". "It's Been Awhile" spent a total of 16 and 14 weeks on top of the modern and mainstream rock charts respectively, making it one of the highest joint numbers of all time.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/280292/staind/chart?f=379|title=Staind - Chart history (Billboard Hot 100)|website=Billboard.com|language=en|access-date=January 20, 2017|archive-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202025540/http://www.billboard.com/artist/280292/staind/chart?f=379|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2001, ''Break the Cycle'' sold four million copies worldwide, making it one of the best selling albums that year.

===''14 Shades of Grey'' (2003–2004)===
In early 2003, Staind embarked on a worldwide tour to promote the release of the follow-up to ''Break the Cycle'', ''[[14 Shades of Grey]]'', which sold two million copies and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200.<ref name=":0" /> The album saw a departure from their previous [[nu metal]] sound as it mostly contained a lighter and more melodic [[post-grunge]] sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/14-shades-of-grey-mw0000031439|title=14 Shades of Grey - Staind {{!}} Review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=AllMusic|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> ''14 Shades of Grey'' produced two mainstream hits, "[[Price to Play]]" and "[[So Far Away (Staind song)|So Far Away]]", which spent 14 weeks on top of the rock chart.<ref name=":1" /> In addition, two other singles were released: "[[How About You (Staind song)|How About You]]" and "Zoe Jane".   The band's appearance at the [[Reading Festival]] during their 2003 tour had another impromptu acoustic set, this time due to equipment failure. The singles "So Far Away" and "Price to Play" came with two unreleased tracks, "Novocaine" and "Let It Out", which were released for the special edition of the group's subsequent album ''[[Chapter V (Staind album)|Chapter V]]'', which came out in late 2005. In 2003, Staind unsuccessfully sued their logo designer Jon Stainbrook in New York Federal Court for attempting to re-use the logo he had sold to the band. They re-opened the case in mid-2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=33361|title=Ohio Musician Files Countersuit Against STAIND For Trademark Infringement|date=March 19, 2005|website=Blabbermouth.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320060517/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=33361|archive-date=March 20, 2005}}</ref>

===''Chapter V'' and ''The Singles'' (2005–2007)===


Staind's fifth album, titled ''[[Chapter V (Staind album)|Chapter V]]'', was released on August 9, 2005, and became their third consecutive album to top the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album opened to sales of 185,000 and has since been certified platinum in the U.S. The first single, "[[Right Here (Staind song)|Right Here]]", was the biggest success from the album, garnering much mainstream radio play and peaking at number 1 on the mainstream rock chart. "Falling" was released as the second single, followed by "[[Everything Changes (Staind song)|Everything Changes]]" and "[[King of All Excuses]]". Staind went on the road when the album came out, doing live shows and promoting it for a full year, including participating in the Fall Brawl tour with [[P.O.D.]], [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]], and [[Flyleaf (band)|Flyleaf]]; they also had a solo tour across Europe and a mini-promotional tour in Australia for the first time. Other live shows included a cover of [[Pantera]]'s "[[This Love (Pantera song)|This Love]]", a tribute to [[Dimebag Darrell]]. Staind appeared on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on August 10, 2005 to promote ''Chapter V''. They performed [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] renditions of the single "Right Here" and [[Beetlejuice (entertainer)|Beetlejuice]]'s song "This is Beetle". In early November 2005, Staind released the limited edition 2-CD/DVD set of ''Chapter V''. On September 6, 2006, they performed an acoustic show in the Hiro Ballroom, New York City, that was recorded for their singles collection. The band played sixteen songs, including three covers: [[Tool (band)|Tool]]'s "[[Sober (Tool song)|Sober]]", [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Comfortably Numb]]", and [[Alice in Chains]]'s "[[Nutshell (song)|Nutshell]]".

The collection ''[[The Singles: 1996–2006]]'' was released on November 14, 2006. It included all the band's singles, the three covers performed at the New York show, and a remastered version of "Come Again" from Staind's first independent release ''[[Tormented (Staind album)|Tormented]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=60472|title=Staind: 'The Singles: 1996-2006' CD, 'Staind: The Videos' DVD details revealed|date=October 18, 2006|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=October 18, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326145334/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=60472|archive-date=March 26, 2007}}</ref>

===''The Illusion of Progress'' (2008–2009)===
On August 19, 2008, Staind released their sixth album, ''[[The Illusion of Progress]]''. Prior to the album's release, the track "This Is It" was available for download on the [[iTunes Store]], as well as for ''[[Rock Band]]''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the U.S. Billboard 200, No.&nbsp;1 on the Top Modern Rock/Alternative Albums Chart, No.&nbsp;1 on the Top Digital Albums Chart, and also No.&nbsp;1 on the Top Internet Albums Chart, with first-week sales of 91,800 units.

The final single released from the album, "This Is It", was sent to radio stations across the country on May 4, 2009.

In late 2014, the band went on a hiatus. Aaron Lewis continued to play solo shows and work on his next solo album. He also confirmed that the hiatus would last "for a while".

On August 4, 2017, the band performed for the first time since November 2014 for an acoustic performance at Aaron Lewis' 6th annual charity golf tournament and concert when bassist Johnny April and drummer Sal Giancarelli joined Aaron Lewis and Mike Mushok to perform "Outside", "Something to Remind You", and "It's Been Awhile".<ref>{{cite web|title=Staind Reunion and Tributes to Chris Cornell + Chester Bennington Highlight Aaron Lewis' Charity Show|date=August 4, 2017|publisher=Loudwire.com|url=http://loudwire.com/staind-reunion-tributes-chris-cornell-chester-bennington-aaron-lewis-charity-show/|access-date=August 4, 2017}}</ref> Three days later, Lewis announced that Staind would never tour extensively again,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/staind-stay-tuned-video-teaser/|title=Staind Share Cryptic Video Teaser Clip|first=Joe|last=DiVita|website=Loudwire.com|date=April 6, 2019 }}</ref> with Lewis explaining:

==Musical style, influences, and lyrical themes==
The topics of Staind's lyrics cover issues of depression, relationships, death, addiction, finding one's self, betrayal, and Lewis's thoughts about becoming a father in the song "Zoe Jane" from ''[[14 Shades of Grey]]'', as well as reflecting on his upbringing in the song "The Corner" from ''[[The Illusion of Progress]]''. Also from ''14 Shades of Grey'', the track titled "Layne" was written about [[Alice in Chains]] frontman [[Layne Staley]] in response to his death in 2002. The song is also about Staley's legacy and the effect his music had on the members of Staind, especially Aaron Lewis.

In 2001, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' outlined the band's relationship to the nu metal label:
{{quote|Staind got their first break in 1998 when [[Fred Durst|[Fred] Durst]] signed the band to his Flip Records. That association has linked the group with "new metal," though ''[[Break the Cycle]]'''s sound is neither particularly new nor [[heavy metal music|metal]]. The band doesn't [[rap music|rap]], and though Mushok has adopted new-metal's [[minor-key]] [[guitar riff]]s, Lewis' dramatic voice and the anthemic quality of such songs as "Open Your Eyes" and "[[Fade (Staind song)|Fade]]" are more akin to [[Alice in Chains]] than to [[Korn]]. Aggressive yet reflective, ''Break the Cycle'' doesn't require a poisonous abundance of testosterone to be appreciated and is better suited to solitary listening than to the [[mosh pit]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/staind-dark-stars-48045/|title=Staind: Dark Stars|first1=Jenny|last1=Eliscu|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=19 July 2001}}</ref>}}
