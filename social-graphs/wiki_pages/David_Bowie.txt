'''David Robert Jones''' (8 January 1947{{spnd}}10 January 2016), known as '''David Bowie''',{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|i}} {{respell|BOH|ee}}<ref name="saybowe">{{cite web |title=How to say: Bowie |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/magazinemonitor/2007/01/how_to_say_bowie.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=8 January 2008 |access-date=16 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308185641/https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/magazinemonitor/2007/01/how_to_say_bowie.shtml |archive-date=8 March 2021}}</ref>}} was an English singer, songwriter and actor. Regarded as among the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Bowie received particular acclaim for his work in the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft have had a great impact on [[popular music]].

Bowie studied art, music and design before embarking on a music career in 1963. He released a string of unsuccessful singles with local bands and [[David Bowie (1967 album)|a self-titled solo album]] (1967) before achieving his first top-five entry on the [[UK singles chart]] with "[[Space Oddity]]" (1969). After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the [[glam rock]] era with the alter ego [[Ziggy Stardust (character)|Ziggy Stardust]]. The single "[[Starman (song)|Starman]]" and its album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972) won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as "[[plastic soul]]", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering his first major US crossover success with the number-one single "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]" and the album ''[[Young Americans]]'' (1975). In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' and released ''[[Station to Station]]''. In 1977, he again changed direction with the [[electronic music|electronic]]-inflected album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', the first of three collaborations with [[Brian Eno]] that came to be known as the [[Berlin Trilogy]]. ''[["Heroes" (David Bowie album)|"Heroes"]]'' (1977) and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top-five and received critical praise.

After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single "[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]", its album ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)]]'' and "[[Under Pressure]]" (a 1981 collaboration with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]). He achieved his greatest commercial success in the 1980s with ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the [[hard rock]] band [[Tin Machine]]. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[Jungle music|jungle]]. He also continued acting; his films included ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983), ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' (1996), and ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006). He retired from touring in 2004 and his last live performance  was at a charity event in 2006. He returned from a decade-long recording hiatus in 2013 with ''[[The Next Day]]''. [[Death of David Bowie|His death]] in 2016 came two days after the release of his final studio album, ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]''.

During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million worldwide, made him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling musicians of all time]]. He is the recipient of [[List of awards and nominations received by David Bowie|numerous accolades]], including six [[Grammy Award]]s and four [[Brit Awards]]. Often dubbed the "chameleon of rock" due to his continual musical reinventions, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him among the greatest [[Rolling Stone's 200 Greatest Singers of All Time|singers]], [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|songwriters]] and [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|artists]] of all time. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.

==Early life==
David Robert Jones was born on 8&nbsp;January 1947 in [[Brixton]], London.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/musician/david-bowie |title=David Bowie |publisher=[[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (American TV channel)|FYI]]/[[A&E Networks]]) |access-date=20 June 2022 |archive-date=14 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210314180329/https://www.biography.com/musician/david-bowie |url-status=live }}</ref> His mother, Margaret Mary "Peggy" (née Burns),<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news |title=Bowie mourns mother's death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1256864.stm |url-status=live |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2 April 2001 |access-date=9 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111215005/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1256864.stm |archive-date=11 January 2016}}</ref> was born at [[Shorncliffe Army Camp]] near [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]], Kent.{{sfn|Gillman|Gillman|1987|p=17: "[Peggy] was born in the hospital at Shorncliffe Camp [near Folkestone, Kent] on October 2nd, 1913."}} She was a waitress at a cinema in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]].{{sfn|Gillman|Gillman|1987|p=44: "At the end of the war, Peggy Burns was working as a waitress at the Ritz cinema in Tunbridge Wells"}} His father, Haywood Stenton "John" Jones,<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> was from [[Doncaster]], Yorkshire,{{sfn|Gillman|Gillman|1987|p=44 "John Jones was born in the grimy Yorkshire town of Doncaster in 1912."}} and was a promotions officer for the children's charity [[Barnardo's]]. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and [[Stockwell]] in the south London borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]]. Bowie attended [[Stockwell Primary School|Stockwell Infants School]] until he was six, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=9–16}}

From 1953, Bowie moved with his family to [[Bickley]] and then [[Bromley Common]], before settling in [[Sundridge Park]] in 1955 where he attended Burnt Ash Junior School.<ref>{{cite web |last=Palmer |first=Jim |title=18 south east London places where David Bowie lived, learned and played |url=https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/14195175.map-18-south-east-london-places-where-david-bowie-lived-learned-and-played/ |url-status=live |website=News Shopper |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=31 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210806093810/https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/14195175.map-18-south-east-london-places-where-david-bowie-lived-learned-and-played/ |archive-date=6 August 2021}}</ref> His voice was considered "adequate" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average ability on the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]. At the age of nine, his dancing was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations "vividly artistic" and his poise "astonishing" for a child.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=18–19}} The same year, his father brought home a collection of American [[Gramophone record|45s]] by artists including [[the Teenagers]], [[the Platters]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Little Richard]].{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=21}}{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=19–20}} Upon listening to Little Richard's song "[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]", Bowie later said that he had "heard God".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Doggett|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Doggett|title=Teenage Wildlife|journal=Mojo Classic|issue=60 Years of Bowie|pages=8–9|date=January 2007}}</ref>

Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin Kristina dance to "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]" soon after its release in 1956.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=19–20}} According to Kristina, she and David "danced like possessed elves" to records of various artists.<ref name="Childhood dreams">{{cite news |last=Marsh |first=Joanne |title=David Bowie's cousin pens letter about their childhood: 'He exceeded all his father's dreams' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/david-bowie-76-1199483 |date=18 February 2016 |access-date=26 December 2020 |magazine=[[NME]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117052410/https://www.nme.com/news/music/david-bowie-76-1199483 |archive-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> By the end of the following year, Bowie had taken up the [[ukulele]] and [[tea-chest bass]], begun to participate in [[skiffle]] sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and [[Chuck Berry]]—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local [[Cub Scout|Wolf Cub]] group was described as "mesmerizing&nbsp;... like someone from another planet".{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=19–20}} Having encouraged his son to follow his dreams of being an entertainer since he was a toddler, in the late 1950s David's father took him to meet performers preparing for the [[Royal Variety Performance]], introducing him to [[Alma Cogan]] and [[Tommy Steele]].<ref name="Childhood dreams"/> After taking his [[eleven-plus]] exam, Bowie went to [[Bromley Technical High School]].{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=21–22}} It was an unusual technical school, as biographer [[Christopher Sandford (biographer)|Christopher Sandford]] wrote:

{{blockquote|Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English] [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]. There were [[House system|houses]] named after eighteenth-century statesmen like [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]] and [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]]. There was a uniform and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of [[Owen Frampton]]. In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, [[Peter Frampton|Peter]], to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=21–22}}}}

Bowie's maternal half-brother, Terry Burns, was a substantial influence on his early life.{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chap. 4}} Burns, who was 10 years older than him, had [[schizophrenia]] and [[seizures]], and lived alternately at home and in psychiatric wards. While living with Bowie, he introduced the younger man to many of his lifelong influences, such as [[modern jazz]], [[Buddhism]], [[Beat poetry]] and the [[occult]].{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chap. 3–4}} In addition to Burns, a significant proportion of Bowie's extended family members had [[schizophrenia spectrum disorders]], including an aunt who was institutionalised and another who underwent a [[lobotomy]]; this has been labelled as an influence on his early work.{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chap. 4}}

Bowie studied art, music and design. After Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like [[Charles Mingus]] and [[John Coltrane]] led his mother to give him a [[Grafton saxophone]] in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from [[baritone saxophonist]] [[Ronnie Ross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berklee.edu/commencement/past|title=Commencement 1999 – Berklee College of Music|website=berklee.edu|access-date=10 February 2018|archive-date=10 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180516/https://www.berklee.edu/commencement/past|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=25}}

He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend [[George Underwood (artist)|George Underwood]] punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stokes |first=Tim |title=David Bowie: The man who left the Starman with mismatched eyes |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2r9mvxz2o |access-date=18 October 2024 |website=[[BBC News]] |date=21 September 2024}}</ref> After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation,{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=57}} the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty [[depth perception]] and [[anisocoria]] (a permanently dilated pupil); his eye later became one of Bowie's most recognisable features.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tanya|last=Basu|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/01/story-behind-david-bowies-unusual-eyes.html|title=The Story Behind David Bowie's Unusual Eyes|work=[[The Cut (website)|The Cut]]|date=12 January 2016|access-date=21 January 2016|archive-date=17 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117143944/http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/story-behind-david-bowies-unusual-eyes.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite their altercation, Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood, who went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=19}}

In 1961 he met [[Peter Frampton]], who was three years younger. They were schoolmates at [[Bromley]] Technical School where Frampton's father Owen was their art teacher. Frampton's band the Little Ravens played on the same bill at school as Bowie's band, George and the Dragons. Peter and David would spend lunch breaks together, playing [[Buddy Holly]] songs.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Gosling|first1=Emily|title=Teaching David Bowie|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/may-2012/teaching-david-bowie/|access-date=1 January 2017|magazine=Design Week|date=24 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102081741/https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/may-2012/teaching-david-bowie/|archive-date=2 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Music career==

===1962–1967: Early career to debut album<span class="anchor" id="The Lower Third"></span>===
[[File:David Bowie (1967).png|thumb|upright|alt=A close-up of a man looking to the camera|A trade ad photo of Bowie in 1967]]
Bowie formed his first band, the Konrads, in 1962 at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based [[rock and roll]] at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=28}} When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to entrepreneur [[John Bloom (businessman)|John Bloom]] inviting him to "do for us what [[Brian Epstein]] has done for [[the Beatles]]—and make another million." Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to [[Dick James]]'s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=29–30}}

Conn quickly began to promote Bowie. His debut single, "[[Liza Jane (David Bowie song)|Liza Jane]]", credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=166–167}}{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chaps. 1–2}} Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Willie Dixon]] covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul—"I used to dream of being their [[Mick Jagger]]", he recalled.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=29–30}} Their cover of [[Bobby Bland]]'s "[[I Pity the Fool]]" was no more successful than "Liza Jane", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by [[the Who]]. "[[You've Got a Habit of Leaving]]" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world "to study mime at [[Sadler's Wells]]", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, helped secure him a contract with [[Pye Records]]. Publicist [[Tony Hatch]] signed Bowie on the basis that he wrote his own songs.{{sfn|Trynka|2011|pp=65–66}} Dissatisfied with Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] of [[the Monkees]], he took on the stage name David Bowie after the 19th-century American pioneer [[James Bowie]] and [[Bowie knife|the knife he had popularised]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=64–67}}{{sfn|Trynka|2011|pp=54–59}}{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=33}} His first release under the name was the January 1966 single "[[Can't Help Thinking About Me]]", recorded with the Lower Third.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=55–57}} It flopped like its predecessors.{{sfn|Trynka|2011|pp=69–70}}

Bowie departed the Lower Third after the single's release, partly due to Horton's influence,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=55–57}} and released two more singles for Pye, "[[Do Anything You Say]]" and "[[I Dig Everything]]", both of which featured a new band called the Buzz, before signing with [[Deram Records]].{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chaps. 1–2}} Around this time Bowie also joined [[the Riot Squad]]; their recordings, which included one of Bowie's original songs and material by [[the Velvet Underground]], went unreleased. [[Kenneth Pitt]], introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=35–39}} His April 1967 solo single, "[[The Laughing Gnome]]", on which speeded-up and high-pitched vocals were used to portray the gnome, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, ''[[David Bowie (1967 album)|David Bowie]]'', an amalgam of pop, [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelia]] and [[music hall]], met the same fate. It was his last release for two years.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=41–42}} In September, Bowie recorded "[[Let Me Sleep Beside You]]" and "[[Karma Man]]", both rejected by Deram and left unreleased until 1970. The tracks marked the beginning of Bowie's working relationship with producer [[Tony Visconti]] which, with large gaps, lasted for the rest of Bowie's career.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=146, 157}}{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chap. 2}}

=== 1968–1971: ''Space Oddity'' to ''Hunky Dory'' ===
{{anchor|Hermione Farthingale}}
Studying the dramatic arts under [[Lindsay Kemp]], from [[avant-garde]] theatre and [[mime]] to [[commedia dell'arte]], Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, his composition "Over the Wall We Go" became a 1967 single for [[Paul Nicholas|Oscar]]; another Bowie song, "[[Silly Boy Blue]]", was released by [[Billy Fury]] the following year.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=46}} Playing acoustic guitar, Hermione Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a few concerts combining folk, [[Merseybeat]], poetry and mime.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=49–52}}

After the break-up with Farthingale, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan as her lodger.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=53}} In February and March 1969, he undertook a short tour with [[Marc Bolan]]'s duo [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]], as third on the bill, performing a mime act.{{sfn|Paytress|2009|p=199}} Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale, Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in [[Beckenham]] High Street.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=53}} The club was influenced by the [[Arts Lab]] movement, developing into the [[Beckenham Arts Lab]] and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival in a local park, the subject of his song "[[Memory of a Free Festival]]".{{sfn|McKay|1996|p=188}}

[[File:David Bowie Plaque, Trident Studios, London copy.jpg|thumb|Plaque at [[Trident Studios]] in London marking where Bowie recorded six albums between 1969 and 1974]]
Pitt attempted to introduce Bowie to a larger audience with the ''[[Love You till Tuesday (film)|Love You till Tuesday]]'' film, which went unreleased until 1984.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=636–638}} Feeling alienated over his unsuccessful career and deeply affected by his break-up, Bowie wrote "[[Space Oddity]]", a tale about a fictional astronaut named [[Major Tom]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=255–260}}{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=104}}{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chap. 3}} The song earned him a contract with [[Mercury Records]] and its UK subsidiary [[Philips Records|Philips]], who issued "Space Oddity" as a single on 11&nbsp;July 1969, five days ahead of the [[Apollo 11]] launch.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=255–260}} Reaching the top five in the UK,{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=49–50}} it was his first and last hit for three years.<ref>{{cite web |last=Parker |first=Lyndsey |authorlink = Lyndsey Parker| url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/the-odd-story-of-space-oddity-how-a-novelty-record-launched-david-bowie-into-the-stratosphere-50-years-ago-170000604.html |title=The odd story of 'Space Oddity': How a 'cheap shot' 'novelty record' launched David Bowie into the stratosphere 50 years ago |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |date=10 July 2019 |access-date=22 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711182011/https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/the-odd-story-of-space-oddity-how-a-novelty-record-launched-david-bowie-into-the-stratosphere-50-years-ago-170000604.html |archive-date=11 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bowie's second album followed in November. Originally issued in the UK as ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'', it caused some confusion with its predecessor of the same name, and the US release was instead titled ''Man of Words/Man of Music''; it was reissued internationally in 1972 by [[RCA Records]] as ''Space Oddity''. Featuring philosophical post-[[hippie]] lyrics on peace, love and morality, its acoustic folk rock occasionally fortified by harder rock, the album was not a commercial success at the time.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=54–60}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=169–171}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=338}}

Bowie met [[Angela Barnett]] in April 1969. They married within a year. Her impact on him was immediate—he wrote his 1970 single "[[The Prettiest Star]]" for her{{sfn|Spitz|2009|pp=131–132}}—and her involvement in his career was far-reaching, leaving Pitt with limited influence which he found frustrating.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=54–60}} Having established himself as a solo artist with "Space Oddity", Bowie desired a full-time band he could record with and could relate to personally.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=62–63}} The band Bowie assembled comprised John Cambridge, a drummer Bowie met at the Arts Lab, Visconti on bass and [[Mick Ronson]] on electric guitar. Known as [[Hype (David Bowie band)|Hype]], the bandmates created characters for themselves and wore elaborate costumes that prefigured the glam style of the Spiders from Mars. After a disastrous opening gig at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|London Roundhouse]], they reverted to a configuration presenting Bowie as a solo artist.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=62–63}}{{sfn|Buckley|2000|pp=89–90}} Their initial studio work was marred by a heated disagreement between Bowie and Cambridge over the latter's drumming style, leading to his replacement by [[Mick Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=67}} Not long after, Bowie fired his manager and replaced him with [[Tony Defries]]. This resulted in years of litigation that concluded with Bowie having to pay Pitt compensation.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=67}}

The studio sessions continued and resulted in Bowie's third album, ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' (1970), which contained references to schizophrenia, paranoia and delusion.<ref>{{cite web|first=Karl|last=Smith|title=Random Ultra-Violence: Simon Critchley On David Bowie|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/16414-david-bowie-simon-critchley-biography-extract-2|work=[[The Quietus]] |date=6 October 2014|access-date=14 December 2014|archive-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141006214717/http://thequietus.com/articles/16414-david-bowie-simon-critchley-biography-extract-2|url-status=live}}</ref> It represented a departure from the acoustic guitar and folk rock style established by his second album,{{sfn|Perone|2012|p=90}} to a more [[hard rock]] sound.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=106}} Mercury financed a coast-to-coast publicity tour across the US in which Bowie, between January and February 1971, was interviewed by media.

During the tour, Bowie's observation of two seminal American [[proto-punk]] artists led him to develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a melding of the persona of [[Iggy Pop]] with the music of [[Lou Reed]], producing "the ultimate pop idol".{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=73–74}} Bowie later stated, "It's not who does it first, it's who does it second."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reesman |first=Bryan |date=7 June 2024 |title=2 Bon Jovi Hits and 1 Deep Cut Cribbed from Other Songs |url=https://americansongwriter.com/2-bon-jovi-hits-and-1-deep-cut-cribbed-from-other-songs/ |access-date=6 March 2025 |website=American Songwriter}}</ref> A girlfriend recalled his "scrawling notes on a cocktail napkin about a crazy rock star named Iggy or Ziggy", and on his return to England he declared his intention to create a character "who looks like he's landed from Mars".{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=73–74}} The "Stardust" surname was a tribute to the "[[Legendary Stardust Cowboy]]", whose record he was given during the tour. Bowie later covered "I Took a Trip on a Gemini Space Ship" on 2002's ''[[Heathen (David Bowie album)|Heathen]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=177}}

''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971) found Visconti supplanted in both roles by [[Ken Scott]] producing and [[Trevor Bolder]] on bass. It again featured a stylistic shift towards [[art pop]] and melodic [[pop rock]],<ref>{{harvnb|Sullivan|2017|p=494}}; {{harvnb|Doggett|2012|p=11}}.</ref> with light fare tracks such as "[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]", a song written for his son, [[Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones]], born on 30&nbsp;May.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=95–99}} Elsewhere, the album explored more serious subjects, and found Bowie paying unusually direct homage to his influences with "[[Song for Bob Dylan]]", "[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]" and "[[Queen Bitch]]", the latter a Velvet Underground pastiche.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=85–86}} His first release through RCA,{{sfn|Trynka|2011|p=174}} it was a commercial failure,{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=104}} partly due lack of promotion from the label.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=348–349}} [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]] covered the album's track  "[[Oh!

===1972–1974: Glam rock era===
[[File:David-Bowie Early.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=A shot of a man with an acoustic guitar taken from below|Bowie during the [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]], 1972]]
Dressed in a striking costume, his hair dyed reddish-brown, Bowie launched his Ziggy Stardust stage show with [[the Spiders from Mars]]—Ronson, Bolder, and Woodmansey—at the Toby Jug pub in [[Tolworth]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]] on 10&nbsp;February 1972.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=135–136}} The show was hugely popular, catapulting him to stardom as he toured the UK over the next six months and creating, as described by David Buckley, a "cult of Bowie" that was "unique—its influence lasted longer and has been more creative than perhaps almost any other force within pop fandom."{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=135–136}} ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972), combining the hard rock elements of ''The Man Who Sold the World'' with the lighter experimental rock and pop of ''Hunky Dory'', was released in June and was considered one of the defining albums of [[glam rock]]. "[[Starman (song)|Starman]]", issued as an April single ahead of the album, was to cement Bowie's UK breakthrough: both single and album charted rapidly following his July ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performance of the song. The album, which remained in the chart for two years, was soon joined there by the six-month-old ''Hunky Dory''. At the same time, the non-album single "[[John, I'm Only Dancing]]" and "[[All the Young Dudes]]", a song he wrote and produced for [[Mott the Hoople]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Why David Bowie gave away All the Young Dudes to Mott the Hoople |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/david-bowie-gave-away-young-10749662 |website=Wales Online |date=18 January 2016 |access-date=12 October 2019 |archive-date=12 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012143448/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/david-bowie-gave-away-young-10749662 |url-status=live}}</ref> were successful in the UK. The [[Ziggy Stardust Tour]] continued to the United States.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=93–95}}

Bowie contributed backing vocals, keyboards and guitar to Reed's 1972 solo breakthrough ''[[Transformer (Lou Reed album)|Transformer]]'', co-producing the album with Ronson.{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=156}} The following year, Bowie co-produced and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] [[the Stooges]]' album ''[[Raw Power]]'' alongside Iggy Pop.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|author-link=Rob Sheffield|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-america-inspired-david-bowie-to-kill-ziggy-stardust-with-aladdin-sane-230827/|title=How America Inspired David Bowie to Kill Ziggy Stardust With 'Aladdin Sane'|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=13 April 2016|access-date=14 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200514165306/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-america-inspired-david-bowie-to-kill-ziggy-stardust-with-aladdin-sane-230827/|archive-date=14 May 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> His own ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' (1973) was his first UK number-one album. Described by Bowie as "Ziggy goes to America", it contained songs he wrote while travelling to and across the US during the earlier part of the Ziggy tour, which now continued to Japan to promote the new album. ''Aladdin Sane'' spawned the UK top five singles "[[The Jean Genie]]" and "[[Drive-In Saturday]]".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=361–364}}{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=108}}

Bowie's love of acting led to his total immersion in the characters he created for his music. "Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David." With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust—and later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour&nbsp;... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity."{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=106–107}} His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both ''Ziggy Stardust'' and ''Aladdin Sane'', were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a [[sumo]] wrestling loincloth or simulating [[oral sex]] with Ronson's guitar.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=7}} Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage "retirement" at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 3&nbsp;July 1973.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=165–167}} Footage from the final show was incorporated for the film ''[[Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (film)|Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', which premiered in 1979 and commercially released in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phfilms.com/films/ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from-mars|title=Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|website=phfilms.com|publisher=Pennebaker Hegedus Films|access-date=3 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004192802/https://phfilms.com/films/ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from-mars/|archive-date=4 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

After breaking up the Spiders, Bowie attempted to move on from his Ziggy persona. His back catalogue was now highly sought after: ''The Man Who Sold the World'' had been re-released in 1972 along with ''Space Oddity''. ''Hunky Dory''{{'s}} "[[Life on Mars?]]" was released in June 1973 and peaked at number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Entering the same chart in September, his 1967 novelty record "The Laughing Gnome" reached number six.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=163}} ''[[Pin Ups]]'', a collection of covers of his 1960s favourites, followed in October, producing a UK number three hit in his version of [[the McCoys]]'s "[[Sorrow (The McCoys song)|Sorrow]]" and itself peaking at number one, making Bowie the best-selling act of 1973 in the UK. It brought the total number of Bowie albums concurrently on the UK chart to six.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=115}}

===1974–1976: "Plastic soul" and the Thin White Duke===
[[File:David Bowie - TopPop 1974 08.png|thumb|left|alt=A man with an eyepatch playing a guitar|Bowie performing "[[Rebel Rebel]]" on ''[[TopPop]]'' in February 1974]]
Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=3}} ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974), parts of which found him heading towards [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]], was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-[[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] city, and setting [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' to music.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=180–183}} The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits "[[Rebel Rebel]]" and "[[Diamond Dogs (song)|Diamond Dogs]]", and number five in the US. The supporting [[Diamond Dogs Tour]] visited cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by [[Toni Basil]], and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by [[Alan Yentob]]. The resulting documentary, ''[[Cracked Actor]]'', featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with his slide from heavy [[cocaine]] use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, [[paranoia]] and emotional problems.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=204–205}} He later commented that the accompanying live album, ''[[David Live]]'', ought to have been titled "David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory".{{sfn|Egan|2015|p=[https://archive.org/details/bowieonbowieinte0000unse/page/66/mode/2up 66]}} ''David Live'' nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US. It also spawned a UK number ten hit in a cover of [[Eddie Floyd]]'s "[[Knock on Wood (Eddie Floyd song)|Knock on Wood]]". After a break in [[Philadelphia]], where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=128}}

[[File:Bowie-DD-1974-3.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A man with a robe singing into a microphone|Bowie performing on the [[Diamond Dogs Tour]], July 1974]]
The fruit of the Philadelphia recording sessions was ''[[Young Americans]]'' (1975). Sandford writes, "Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now."{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=138}} The album's sound, which Bowie identified as "[[plastic soul]]", constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=68–74}} ''Young Americans'' was a commercial success in both the US and the UK and yielded Bowie's first US number one, "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]", a collaboration with [[John Lennon]].{{sfn|O'Leary|2015|loc=chap. 9}} A re-issue of the 1969 single "Space Oddity" became Bowie's first number-one hit in the UK a few months after "Fame" achieved the same in the US.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=120}} He mimed "Fame" and his November single "[[Golden Years (David Bowie song)|Golden Years]]" on the US variety show ''[[Soul Train]]'', earning him the distinction of being one of the first white artists to appear on the programme.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=565–566}} The same year, Bowie fired Defries as his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, he watched, as described by Sandford, "millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered" in what were "uniquely generous terms for Defries", then "shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door."{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=135–136}} Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager, but was fired the following year.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=137, 153}}

[[File:David Bowie and Cher 1975.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A man with a woman holding a microphone|Bowie performs with [[Cher]] on the variety show ''[[Cher (TV series)|Cher]]'', 1975.]]
''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976), produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=380–382}} introduced a new Bowie persona, [[the Thin White Duke]] of its [[Station to Station (song)|title track]]. Visually, the character was an extension of Thomas Jerome Newton, the extraterrestrial being he portrayed in the film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' the same year.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=238}} Developing the funk and soul of ''Young Americans'', ''Station to Station''{{'}}s synthesiser-heavy arrangements were influenced by [[Electronic music|electronic]] and German [[krautrock]].{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78–80}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=380–382}} Bowie's cocaine addiction during this period was at its peak; he often did not sleep for three to four days at a time during ''Station to Station''{{'s}} recording sessions and later said he remembered "only flashes" of its making.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|pp=259–266}} His sanity—by his own later admission—had become twisted from cocaine;{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=204–205}} he referenced the drug directly in the album's ten-minute title track.{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|pp=7–8}} The album's release was followed by a {{frac|3|1|2}}-month-long concert tour, the [[Isolar – 1976 Tour|Isolar Tour]], of Europe and North America. The core band that coalesced to record the album and tour—rhythm guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]], bassist [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]] and drummer [[Dennis Davis]]—continued as a stable unit for the remainder of the 1970s. Bowie performed on stage as the Thin White Duke.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=566–568}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78–80}}

[[File:David Bowie 1976.jpg|thumb|alt=A man leaning against a piano holding a microphone|Bowie as [[the Thin White Duke]] at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], Toronto, 1976]]
The tour was highly successful but mired in political controversy. Bowie was quoted as saying that "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader", and was detained by customs on the Russian/Polish border for possessing [[Nazi]] paraphernalia.{{sfn|Buckley|2000|pp=289–291}} Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the "[[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] incident".

After completing ''Low'' and ''"Heroes"'', Bowie spent much of 1978 on the [[Isolar II – The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II world tour]], bringing the music of the first two Berlin Trilogy albums to almost a million people during 70 concerts in 12 countries. By now he had broken his drug addiction; Buckley writes that Isolar II was "Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage.&nbsp;...

The final piece in what Bowie called his "[[triptych]]", ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient nature of its two predecessors, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[world music]], in places incorporating [[Phrygian dominant scale|Hijaz]] [[Musical scale#Non-Western scales|non-Western scales]]. Some tracks were composed using Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards: "Boys Keep Swinging" entailed band members swapping instruments, "Move On" used the chords from Bowie's early composition "All the Young Dudes" played backwards, and "Red Money" took backing tracks from ''The Idiot''{{'s}} "Sister Midnight".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=102–107}}{{sfn|O'Leary|2019|loc=chap. 3}} The album was recorded in Switzerland and New York City.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=394–396}} Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman described it as "a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology." ''Lodger'' reached number four in the UK and number 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles "[[Boys Keep Swinging]]" and "[[DJ (David Bowie song)|DJ]]".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=281}}{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=191–192}} Towards the end of the year, Bowie and Angie initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=197}} The three albums were later adapted into classical music symphonies by American composer [[Philip Glass]] for his [[Symphony No. 1 (Glass)|first]], [[Symphony No. 4 (Glass)|fourth]] and [[Symphony No. 12 (Glass)|twelfth]] symphonies in 1992, 1997 and 2019, respectively.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=490–493}} Glass praised Bowie's gift for creating "fairly complex pieces of music, masquerading as simple pieces".{{sfn|Thomson|1993|p=xiii}}

===1980–1988: New Romantic and pop era===
''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)]]'' (1980) produced the number one single "[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]", featuring the textural guitar-synthesiser work of [[Chuck Hammer]] and revisiting the character of Major Tom from "Space Oddity". The song gave international exposure to the underground [[New Romantic]] movement when Bowie visited the London club "Blitz"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including [[Steve Strange]] of the band [[Visage (band)|Visage]]) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=27–30}} While ''Scary Monsters'' used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Fripp and [[Pete Townshend]].{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=108–114}} Topping the UK Albums Chart for the first time since ''Diamond Dogs'',{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=204}} Buckley writes that with ''Scary Monsters'', Bowie achieved "the perfect balance" of creativity and mainstream success.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=321–322}}

Bowie paired with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1981 for a one-off single release, "[[Under Pressure]]". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=291}} Bowie was given the lead role in the [[BBC]]'s 1982 televised adaptation of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s play ''[[Baal (play)|Baal]]''.

Bowie took an acting role in the 1986 film ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'', and his [[Absolute Beginners (David Bowie song)|title song]] rose to number two in the UK charts. He also worked with composer [[Trevor Jones (composer)|Trevor Jones]] and wrote five original songs for the 1986 film ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'', which he starred in.{{sfn|O'Leary|2019|loc=chap. 5}} His final solo album of the decade was 1987's ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'', where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead combining pop rock with a harder rock sound.{{sfn|O'Leary|2019|loc=chap. 6}} Peaking at number six in the UK, the album yielded the hits "[[Day-In Day-Out]]", "[[Time Will Crawl]]" and "[[Never Let Me Down (David Bowie song)|Never Let Me Down]]".

{{main|Tin Machine}}
Wanting to completely rejuvenate himself following the critical failures of ''Tonight'' and ''Never Let Me Down'',{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=411–412}} Bowie placed his solo career on hold after meeting guitarist [[Reeves Gabrels]] and formed the hard rock quartet [[Tin Machine]]. The line-up was completed by bassist and drummer [[Tony Fox Sales|Tony]] and [[Hunt Sales]], who had played with Bowie on Iggy Pop's ''Lust for Life'' in 1977.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=387}}{{sfn|O'Leary|2019|loc=chap. 7}} Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=274}} The band's 1989 [[Tin Machine (album)|self-titled debut album]] received mixed reviews and,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=414–415}} according to author [[Paul Trynka]], was quickly dismissed as "pompous, dogmatic and dull".{{sfn|Trynka|2011|p=492}} EMI complained of "lyrics that preach" as well as "repetitive tunes" and "minimalist or no production".{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=273}} It reached number three in the UK and was supported by a twelve-date [[Tin Machine Tour|tour]].{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=391}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=588–589}}

In October 1990, Bowie and supermodel [[Iman (model)|Iman]] were introduced by a mutual friend. He recalled, "I was naming the children the night we met&nbsp;... it was absolutely immediate." They married in 1992.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=288–289}} Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=292}} ''[[Tin Machine II]]'' (1991) was Bowie's first album to miss the UK top 20 in nearly twenty years,{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=408–410}} and was controversial for its cover art. Depicting four ancient nude [[Kouroi]] statues, the new record label, [[Victory Records|Victory]], deemed the cover "a show of wrong, obscene images" and airbrushed the statues' genitalia for the American release.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=415–417}}{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=292}} Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album ''[[Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby]]'' (1992) failed commercially, Bowie dissolved the band and resumed his solo career.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=594–595}} He continued to collaborate with Gabrels for the rest of the 1990s.{{sfn|O'Leary|2019|loc=chap. 7}}

In October 2001, Bowie opened [[the Concert for New York City]], a charity event to benefit the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]], with a minimalist performance of [[Simon & Garfunkel]]'s "[[America (Simon & Garfunkel song)|America]]", followed by a full band performance of "{{-'}}Heroes{{'-}}".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=491}} 2002 saw the release of ''Heathen'', and, during the second half of the year, the [[Heathen Tour]]. Taking place in Europe and North America, the tour opened at London's annual ''[[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]]'' festival, for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director. Among the acts he selected for the festival were Philip Glass, [[Television (band)|Television]] and [[the Dandy Warhols]]. As well as songs from the new album, the tour featured material from Bowie's ''Low'' era.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=493–495}} ''[[Reality (David Bowie album)|Reality]]'' (2003) followed, and its accompanying world tour, the [[A Reality Tour]], with an estimated attendance of 722,000, grossed more than any other in 2004. On 13&nbsp;June, Bowie headlined the last night of the [[Isle of Wight Festival 2004]].{{sfn|O'Leary|2019|loc=chap. 13}} On 25&nbsp;June, he experienced chest pain while performing at the [[Hurricane Festival]] in [[Scheeßel]], Germany.

The remaining fourteen dates of the tour were cancelled.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=504–505}}

In the years following his recuperation from the heart attack, Bowie reduced his musical output, making only one-off appearances on stage and in the studio. He sang in a duet of his 1971 song "[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]" with [[Butterfly Boucher]] for the 2004 animated film ''[[Shrek 2]]''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=58–59}} During a relatively quiet 2005, he recorded the vocals for the song "(She Can) Do That", co-written with [[Brian Transeau]], for the film ''[[Stealth (film)|Stealth]]''.{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=142}} He returned to the stage on 8&nbsp;September 2005, appearing with [[Arcade Fire]] for the US nationally televised event Fashion Rocks, and performed with the Canadian band for the second time a week later during the [[CMJ]] Music Marathon.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|pp=291–292}} He contributed backing vocals on [[TV on the Radio]]'s song "Province" for their album ''[[Return to Cookie Mountain]]'', and joined with [[Lou Reed]] on Danish alt-rockers [[Kashmir (Danish band)|Kashmir]]'s 2005 album ''[[No Balance Palace]]''.{{sfn|O'Leary|2019|loc=chap. 13}}

==Acting career==
{{main|David Bowie filmography}}
In addition to music, Bowie took acting roles throughout his career, appearing in over 30 films, television shows and theatrical productions.

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
Bowie's acting career predated his commercial breakthrough as a musician. His first film was a short fourteen-minute black-and-white film called ''[[The Image (1969 film)|The Image]]'', shot in September 1967. Concerning a ghostly boy who emerges from a troubled artist's painting to haunt him, Bowie later called the film "awful".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|loc=chap. 6}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=49}} From December 1967 to March 1968, Bowie acted in mime Lindsay Kemp's theatrical production ''Pierrot in Turquoise'', during which he performed several songs from his self-titled debut album. The production was later adapted into the 1970 television film ''The Looking Glass Murders''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|loc=chap. 6}} In late January 1968, Bowie filmed a walk-on role for the BBC drama series ''[[Theatre 625]]'' that aired in May.{{sfn|Trynka|2011|p=99}} He also appeared as a walk-on extra in the [[The Virgin Soldiers (film)|1969 film adaptation]] of [[Leslie Thomas]]'s 1966 [[comic novel]] ''[[The Virgin Soldiers]]''.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=49}}

Bowie's first major film role was in [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''The Man Who Fell to Earth'', in which he portrayed Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet.<ref>{{cite web |last=Webster |first=Andy |title=The Man Who Fell Into Movie Acting |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/movies/the-man-who-fell-into-movie-acting.html |website=The New York Times |date=2 August 2013 |access-date=5 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308171125/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/movies/the-man-who-fell-into-movie-acting.html|archive-date=8 March 2021}}</ref> The actor's severe cocaine addiction at the time left him in such a fragile state of mind that he barely understood the film;<ref>{{cite web |last=McManus |first=Brian |title=Remembering David Bowie's Movie Career |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/david-bowie-actor/ |website=Vice |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=10 November 2019|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110150239/https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wd7yqb/david-bowie-actor|archive-date=10 November 2019}}</ref> he later said in 1993: "My one snapshot of that film is not having to act. Just being me as I was, was perfectly adequate for the role. I wasn't of this earth at that particular time."{{sfn|Pegg|2016|loc=chap. 6}} Bowie's role was particularly singled out for praise by film critics both on release and in later decades; Pegg argues it stands as Bowie's most significant role.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|loc=chap. 6}} In 1978, Bowie had a starring role in ''[[Just a Gigolo (1978 film)|Just a Gigolo]]'', directed by [[David Hemmings]], portraying Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, discovers life has changed and becomes a gigolo employed by a Baroness, playing by [[Marlene Dietrich]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=660–661}} The film was a critical and commercial failure, and Bowie expressed disappointment in the finished product.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=MacKinnon|first=Angus|date=13 September 1980|title=The Future Isn't What It Used to Be|magazine=NME|pages=32–37}}</ref>

From July 1980 to January 1981, Bowie played [[Joseph Merrick]] in the Broadway theatre production ''[[The Elephant Man (play)|The Elephant Man]]'', which he undertook wearing no stage make-up, earning critical praise for his performance.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=662–664}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=324–325}} ''[[Christiane F.

===Painter and art collector===
{{See also|David Bowie's art collection}}
Bowie was a painter and artist. He moved to Switzerland in 1976, purchasing a chalet in the hills north of [[Lake Geneva]]. In the new environment, his cocaine use decreased,<ref>{{Cite news |first=Malcolm |last=Curtis |url=https://www.thelocal.ch/20160111/bowies-discreet-time-in-switzerland-remembered |title=Bowie's discreet time in Switzerland recalled |work=[[The Local]] |date=11 January 2016|access-date=22 September 2017|archive-date=22 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922194144/https://www.thelocal.ch/20160111/bowies-discreet-time-in-switzerland-remembered|url-status=live}}</ref> and he devoted more time to his painting, producing a number of [[post-modernist]] pieces. When on tour, he took to sketching in a notebook, and photographing scenes for later reference. Visiting galleries in [[Geneva]] and the [[Brücke Museum]] in Berlin, Bowie became, in the words of Sandford, "a prolific producer and collector of contemporary art.&nbsp;... Not only did he become a well-known patron of [[expressionist art]]: locked in Clos des Mésanges he began an intensive self-improvement course in classical music and literature, and started work on an autobiography."{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=154–155}}

===Writings===
Outside of music, Bowie dabbled in several forms of writings during his life. In the late 1990s, Bowie was commissioned for writings of various media, including an essay on Jean-Michel Basquiat for the 2001 anthology book ''Writers on Artists'' and forewords to Jo Levin's 2001 publication ''GQ Cool'', Mick Rock's 2001 photography portfolio ''Blood and Glitter'', his wife Iman's 2001 book ''I Am Iman'', ''Q'' magazine's 2002 special ''The 100 Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Photographs'' and Jonathan Barnbrook's artwork portfolio ''Barnbrook Bible: The Graphic Design of Jonathan Barnbrook''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=698}} He also heavily contributed to the 2002 Genesis Publications memoir of the Ziggy Stardust years, ''Moonage Daydream'', which was rereleased in 2022.<ref>{{cite web |last=Aswad |first=Jem |title=David Bowie 'Moonage Daydream' Massive Photo Book to Be Released in Anniversary Edition |url=https://variety.com/2022/music/news/david-bowie-moonage-daydream-photo-book-1235392430/ |website=Variety |access-date=16 October 2022 |date=4 October 2022 |archive-date=16 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221016205819/https://variety.com/2022/music/news/david-bowie-moonage-daydream-photo-book-1235392430/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Musicianship==

From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and roll singers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor [[Anthony Newley]], whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, ''David Bowie'' (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher).{{sfn|Sandford|1997|pp=41–42}}{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=4}} Bowie's fascination with music hall continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.{{sfn|Perone|2007|pp=22, 36–37}}

The musicologist James E. Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in "Space Oddity", and later in "{{-'}}Heroes{{'-}}" to dramatic effect; the author writes that "in the lowest part of his vocal register&nbsp;... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness".{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=12}} The voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as "particularly deliberate and distinctive".{{sfn|Thompson|2004|p=76}} The authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz call him "a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect."{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=483}} Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, Bowie's roleplaying is evident: the historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics "arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them&nbsp;... His voice changes dramatically from section to section."{{sfn|Campbell|2008|p=254}} In addition to the guitar, Bowie also played a variety of keyboards, including piano, Mellotron, Chamberlin, and synthesisers; harmonica; alto and baritone saxophones; [[stylophone]]; viola; cello; koto; [[thumb piano]]; drums; and various percussion instruments.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=346}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Bowie|first=Jerry|last=Hopkins|publisher=MacMillan|year=1985|isbn=978-0-02-553730-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/bowie00hopk/page/239 239]|url=https://archive.org/details/bowie00hopk/page/239}}</ref>{{sfn|Perone|2007|pp=17–44, 152–160}}{{sfn|Buckley|2004|p=48}}

==Political views==
In his first ever television interview, Bowie, under the name Davie Jones, spoke out about prejudice against long-haired men after he and his then-band the Manish Boys were asked to cut their hair before a BBC television appearance. He and the Manish Boys were interviewed on the network's 12&nbsp;November 1964 instalment of ''[[Tonight (1957 TV programme)|Tonight]]'' to champion their cause, where Bowie claimed to be a spokesperson for the nonexistent Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Long-Haired Men.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=521}} He stated on the programme, "I think we all like long hair and we don't see why other people should persecute us because of it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/how-david-bowie-changed-beauty|last=Valdesolo|first=Fiorella|title=How David Bowie Changed the Way We Look at Beauty|website=Glamour|date=12 January 2016|access-date=13 September 2021|archive-date=13 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210913103142/https://www.glamour.com/story/how-david-bowie-changed-beauty|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1976, speaking as the Thin White Duke persona and "at least partially tongue-in-cheek", he made statements that expressed support for [[fascism]] and perceived admiration for [[Adolf Hitler]] in interviews with ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[NME]]'' and a Swedish publication. Bowie was quoted as saying: "Britain is ready for a fascist leader&nbsp;... I think Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism ... I believe very strongly in fascism, people have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership." He was also quoted as saying: "Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars" and "You've got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race|title=1978, the year rock found the power to unite|last=Manzoor|first=Sarfraz|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=15 January 2015|date=20 April 2008|archive-date=27 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227033900/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race|url-status=live}}</ref> These comments, along with [[Eric Clapton]]'s comments in support of [[Enoch Powell]] at that time, have been named as an inspiration for the formation of the [[Rock Against Racism]] movement.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/23/death-threats-rock-against-racism-fascism-national-front-clash-rar | title= 'If there are death threats, don't tell me' – how Rock Against Racism fought fascism | work=The Guardian | first=Tim | last=Jonze | date=23 August 2022 | access-date=1 June 2024}}</ref> Bowie retracted his comments in an interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in October 1977, blaming them on mental instability caused by his drug problems, saying: "I was out of my mind, totally, completely crazed."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gilmore |first=Mikal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/cover-story-excerpt-david-bowie-20120118|title=Cover Story Excerpt: David Bowie|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=18 January 2012|access-date=11 January 2016|archive-date=16 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216064719/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/cover-story-excerpt-david-bowie-20120118|url-status=live}}</ref> In the same interview, Bowie described himself as "apolitical", stating: <blockquote>the more I travel and the less sure I am about exactly which political philosophies are commendable.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Bowie's public statements shifted sharply towards [[anti-racism]] and [[anti-fascism]]. In an interview with [[MTV]] anchor [[Mark Goodman]] in 1983, Bowie criticised the channel for not providing enough coverage of Black musicians, becoming visibly uncomfortable when Goodman suggested that the network's fear of backlash from the [[American Midwest]] was one reason for such a lack of coverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZGiVzIr8Qg| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211114/XZGiVzIr8Qg| archive-date=14 November 2021| url-status=live|title=David Bowie Criticizes MTV for Not Playing Videos by Black Artists|via=YouTube|year=1983|publisher=[[MTV News]]|access-date=13 January 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Why It Took So Long For MTV To Play Black Videos|first=Margena A.|last=Christian|magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=9 October 2006|page=17}}</ref> The music videos for "China Girl" and "Let's Dance" were described by Bowie as a "very simple, very direct" statement against racism.<ref name="LoderMV">{{cite magazine|last=Loder|first=Kurt|author-link=Kurt Loder|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/straight-time-19830512|title=David Bowie: Straight Time|date=12 May 1983|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=13 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612141940/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/straight-time-19830512|archive-date=12 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album ''Tin Machine'' took a more direct stance against fascism and [[neo-Nazism]], and was criticised for being too preachy.{{sfn|Sandford|1997|p=275}} In 1993 he released the single "[[Black Tie White Noise (song)|Black Tie White Noise]]" which dealt with the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=417–421}} In 2007 Bowie donated $10,000 to the defence fund for the [[Jena Six]] saying, "there is clearly a separate and unequal judicial process going on in the town of Jena".<ref>{{cite web |title=David Bowie donates $10,000 to defend US accused |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/david-bowie-363-1343011 |work=NME |date=19 September 2007 |access-date=22 June 2023 |archive-date=22 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230622111714/https://www.nme.com/news/music/david-bowie-363-1343011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Bowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing its immediate forms and subsequent development.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=482}} Perone credited Bowie with having "brought sophistication to rock music", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=482}}{{sfn|Perone|2007|p=183}}{{sfn|Paytress|2003|p=218}} The BBC's arts editor [[Will Gompertz]] likened Bowie to [[Pablo Picasso]], writing that he was "an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions".<ref>{{cite news |last=Gompertz |first=Will |author-link=Will Gompertz |title=David Bowie: The Picasso of pop |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35284134 |url-status=live |work=BBC News |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=19 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416104409/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35284134 |archive-date=16 April 2016}}</ref> Schinder and Schwartz credited Bowie and [[Marc Bolan]] as the founders of the glam rock genre.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=482}} He also inspired the innovators of the [[punk rock]] movement{{sfn|Campbell|2011|p=345}} and explored [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]] styles with the band Tin Machine before those styles became popular.{{sfn|Perone|2007|pp=99–103}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=414–415}}

Broadcaster [[John Peel]] contrasted Bowie with his [[progressive rock]] contemporaries, arguing that he was "an interesting kind of fringe figure&nbsp;... on the outskirts of things". He said he "liked the idea of him reinventing himself&nbsp;... Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change"; then Bowie "subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=524, 529}} Buckley called Bowie "both star and icon. [His] vast body of work&nbsp;... has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.&nbsp;... His influence has been unique in popular culture—he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure."{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=516–517}}

The BBC's [[Mark Easton]] argued that Bowie provided fuel for "the creative powerhouse that Britain has become" by challenging future generations "to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks", concluding that he had "changed the way the world sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself".<ref name="easton"/> In 2006, Bowie was voted the fourth greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBC's ''[[Culture Show]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Jody|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6230201.stm|title=Sixty things about David Bowie|work=BBC News|date=8 January 2007|access-date=22 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110083845/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6230201.stm|archive-date=10 January 2007}}</ref> [[Annie Zaleski]] wrote, "Every band or solo artist who's decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie".<ref>{{cite news|last=Zaleski|first=Annie|author-link=Annie Zaleski|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/how_david_bowie_influenced_our_scene/|title=How David Bowie influenced our scene|work=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|date=12 January 2016|access-date=14 August 2016|archive-date=2 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702210110/http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/how_david_bowie_influenced_our_scene|url-status=live}}</ref>
