'''Metallica''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. It was formed in [[Los Angeles]] in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [[James Hetfield]] and drummer [[Lars Ulrich]], and has been based in [[San Francisco]] for most of its career.<ref name="SF">{{cite news|last1=Pereira|first1=Alyssa|title=Metallica's Black Album turns 25: Here's how local record stores reacted to its sales in 1991|url=https://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Metallica-s-Black-Album-turns-25-9139432.php|access-date=April 20, 2018|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 12, 2016|archive-date=April 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421031609/https://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Metallica-s-Black-Album-turns-25-9139432.php|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="MetallicaOfficial">{{cite web|title=Band History|url=https://www.metallica.com/band/history|website=Metallica official website|access-date=April 20, 2018|archive-date=October 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030210257/http://metallica.com/band/history|url-status=live}}</ref> The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of [[thrash metal]], alongside [[Megadeth]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Slayer]]. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] and bassist [[Robert Trujillo]]. Guitarist [[Dave Mustaine]], who formed Megadeth after being fired from Metallica, and bassists [[Ron McGovney]], [[Cliff Burton]] and [[Jason Newsted]] are former members of the band.

Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' (1988), gave Metallica its first [[Grammy Award]] nomination. Its fifth album, ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'' (1991), was a turning point for the band that saw them transition from their thrash roots; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling more than 16&nbsp;million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the [[Nielsen SoundScan|SoundScan]] era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with its ninth album, ''[[Death Magnetic]]'' (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. The band's eleventh and most recent album, ''[[72 Seasons]]'', was released in 2023.

In 2000, [[Metallica v. Napster, Inc.|Metallica led the case]] against the peer-to-peer file sharing service [[Napster]], in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film ''[[Metallica: Some Kind of Monster]]'', which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, ''[[St. Anger]]'' (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside [[Dane DeHaan]] in the 2013 concert film ''[[Metallica: Through the Never]]'', in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.

==History==
===1981–1984: Formation, early years, and ''Kill 'Em All''===
Metallica was formed in [[Los Angeles]] in late 1981 when Danish drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, ''[[The Recycler]]'', which read, "Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with [[Tygers of Pan Tang]], [[Diamond Head (English band)|Diamond Head]] and [[Iron Maiden]]."<ref name="Timeline 1">{{cite web|title=Metallica Timeline Early 1981 – Early 1982|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315095541/http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=1|publisher=MTV|archive-date=March 15, 2009|access-date=May 28, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Guitarists [[James Hetfield]] and Hugh Tanner of [[Leather Charm]] answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked [[Metal Blade Records]] founder [[Brian Slagel]] if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, ''[[Metal Massacre]]''. Slagel accepted.<ref name="Timeline 1"/> The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metallica.com/history.html |title=History – Metallica |website=Metallica |access-date=March 2, 2020 |archive-date=April 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401002504/https://www.metallica.com/history.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metallica.com/timeline.asp?page=events&n_categoryid=1988&year=1981?sPosx=41 |title=1981: Events |publisher=Metallica.com |access-date=December 26, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623031847/http://www.metallica.com/timeline.asp?page=events&n_categoryid=1988&year=1981%3FsPosx%3D41 |archive-date=June 23, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The band name came from Ulrich's friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine and was considering ''MetalMania'' or ''Metallica''. After hearing the two names, Ulrich wanted the latter for his band, so he suggested Quintana use ''MetalMania'' instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rockandrollgarage.com/lars-ulrich-tells-chose-name-metallica-band/|title=Lars Ulrich tells how they chose the name Metallica for the band|first=Rafael|last=Polcaro|website=Rock and Roll Garage|date=January 5, 2018|access-date=May 3, 2019|archive-date=May 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503062258/http://rockandrollgarage.com/lars-ulrich-tells-chose-name-metallica-band/|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Dave Mustaine]] replied to an advertisement for a lead guitarist; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment.<ref name="Timeline 1"/>

In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song, "Hit the Lights", for the ''Metal Massacre I'' compilation.

The term "[[thrash metal]]" was coined in February 1984 by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' journalist [[Malcolm Dome]] in reference to [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]'s song "[[Metal Thrashing Mad]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Dome|first=Malcolm|author-link=Malcolm Dome|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|title=Anthrax: Fistful Of Metal|volume=62|date=February 23, 1984|page=8}}</ref> Prior to this, Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as "[[power metal]]". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the [[West Hollywood]] nightclub [[Whisky a Go Go]], which featured bassist [[Cliff Burton]] in the band [[Trauma (American band)|Trauma]]. The two were "blown away" by Burton's use of a [[wah-wah pedal]] and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he "didn't contribute anything, he just followed."<ref name="Timeline 2"/> Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year, he had accepted on the condition that the band move to [[El Cerrito, California|El Cerrito]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name="Timeline 2"/> Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the ''Megaforce'' demo (1983).<ref name="Timeline 2">{{cite web|title=Metallica Timeline Fall 1982 – April&nbsp;16, 1983|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227033807/http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/metallica/timeline/?id=3|publisher=MTV|archive-date=December 27, 2008|access-date=May 31, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Metallica was ready to record their debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, they began looking for other options. Concert promoter [[Jon Zazula|Jonathan "Jonny Z" Zazula]], who had heard the demo ''No Life 'til Leather'' (1982), offered to broker a record deal between Metallica and [[New York City]]–based record labels. After those record labels showed no interest, Zazula borrowed enough money to cover the recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, [[Megaforce Records]].<ref name="Pillsbury 2006 2">{{Harvnb|Pillsbury|2006|p=2}}</ref>

Following the release of ''...And Justice for All'', Metallica released its debut music video for the song "One", which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse.

On April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the [[San Francisco Symphony]], which was conducted by [[Michael Kamen]], who had previously worked with producer Rock on "[[Nothing Else Matters]]". Kamen approached Metallica in 1991 with the idea of pairing the band's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event: "[[No Leaf Clover]]" and "-Human". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film ''[[S&M (album)|S&M]]''.

At the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]], Ulrich appeared with host [[Marlon Wayans]] in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Wayans played a college student listening to Metallica's "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation, and he responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just "sharing" by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was "borrowing things that were not yours without asking." He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator [[Shawn Fanning]] responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt that read: "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own." Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, [[Blink-182]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/features/2000/vma00.asp|title=MTV's Video Music Awards 2000: If only I have a brain|publisher=NY Rock|date=September 7, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016194740/http://nyrock.com/features/2000/vma00.asp|archive-date=October 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=115952&page=1|title=Eminem and 'N Sync Big VMA Winners|work=ABC News|access-date=April 21, 2020|archive-date=January 22, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122171541/https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=115952&page=1|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 2016, during the week leading up to [[Record Store Day]], for which the band was its ambassador for 2016, Ulrich told ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' that the band's expanded role within the music industry had played a part in the amount of time that it had taken to write and record the album. "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of ''Kill 'Em All'' and ''Ride the Lightning''. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bienstock|first=Richard|title=Lars Ulrich Takes Us Inside Metallica's Record Store Day Vault, Teases New Album|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/metallica-interview-lars-ulrich-record-store-day-2016-new-album-7326564/|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=April 11, 2016|access-date=April 30, 2016|archive-date=May 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514070258/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7326564/metallica-interview-lars-ulrich-record-store-day-2016-new-album|url-status=live}}</ref> On August 18, 2016, the band announced via their website that their tenth studio album, ''[[Hardwired... to Self-Destruct]]'', would be released worldwide on November 18, 2016, via their independent label, Blackened Recordings.

In an interview with Australian magazine ''[[The Music (magazine)|The Music]]''{{'}}s official podcast in March 2019, Trujillo said that Metallica had begun jamming on new material for its next studio album. "I'm excited about the next record because I believe it will also be a culmination of the two [previous] records and another journey. There's no shortage of original ideas, that's the beauty of being in this band." He estimated that the album would be released sooner than the previous two did, saying: "this time around I think we'll be able to jump on it a lot quicker and jump in the studio and start working."<ref>{{cite news|title=METALLICA's Next Album 'Will Come A Lot Sooner Than The Previous Two Did,' Says ROBERT TRUJILLO|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/metallicas-next-album-will-come-a-lot-sooner-than-the-previous-two-did-says-robert-trujillo/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=March 14, 2019|access-date=March 14, 2019|archive-date=March 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190317041600/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/metallicas-next-album-will-come-a-lot-sooner-than-the-previous-two-did-says-robert-trujillo|url-status=live}}</ref> In an interview with Australian magazine ''Mixdown'' the following month, Hammett said that the band had tentative plans to enter the studio after the conclusion of its WorldWired Tour. He stated, "We're in our third year since ''Hardwired''. Maybe we can get a bit more focus and go into the studio a bit sooner." After not contributing any writing to ''Hardwired... to Self-Destruct'', Hammett said regarding his ideas for the new album, "I have a ton of material.

In an interview on ''Loudwire Nights'' radio program in April 2023, Ulrich stated that "there [were] some ideas [Metallica] could start with" for the follow-up to ''72 Seasons'', adding, "I'm looking forward to going live and being in sharing mode for the next couple of years. The beauty of being with these guys, I kind of joke, James writes more riffs when he's tuning his guitar than most people do in a lifetime. That's the beauty of being in band with these guys and I'm eternally grateful. I'm dumbfounded by it."

During his time as a founding member during the first two years of the band, Mustaine's tenure was marred by his alcoholism and even a physical altercation with James Hetfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/megadeths-dave-mustaine-says-it-was-dumb-punch-metallicas-james-hetfield|title=MEGADETH'S DAVE MUSTAINE SAYS IT WAS "DUMB" TO PUNCH METALLICA'S JAMES HETFIELD|date=September 21, 2022|access-date=February 2, 2024|archive-date=February 2, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240202011904/https://www.revolvermag.com/music/megadeths-dave-mustaine-says-it-was-dumb-punch-metallicas-james-hetfield|url-status=live}}</ref> Mustaine continued to make numerous inflammatory statements against his former band in the press due to buried tension primarily stemming from his firing in 1983 among other issues such as existing songwriting credits across Metallica's first three albums.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Allyson B.|title=Megadeth Frontman Dave Mustaine's Most Controversial Quotes|url=http://noisecreep.com/dave-mustaine-quotes/|website=[[Noisecreep]]|date=April 5, 2012|access-date=November 21, 2013|archive-date=February 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213110231/https://noisecreep.com/dave-mustaine-quotes/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|title=Metallica vs. Dave Mustaine&nbsp;– Nastiest Rock Feuds|url=http://loudwire.com/metallica-vs-dave-mustaine-nastiest-rock-feuds/|work=[[Loudwire]]|date=August 31, 2012|access-date=November 21, 2013|archive-date=February 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213110227/https://loudwire.com/metallica-vs-dave-mustaine-nastiest-rock-feuds/|url-status=live}}</ref> By the late 1980s, it was believed that the feud had largely subsided;

However, the relationship quickly began to deteriorate once again after a dispute with Ulrich insinuating on crediting himself on each of the tracks, much to Mustaine's anger, resulting in the cancellation of the project entirely and reigniting hostility with his former bandmates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metalinjection.net/news/drama/dispute-between-dave-mustaine-lars-ulrich-leads-to-metallicas-no-life-til-leather-reissue-being-shelved|title=Dispute Between Dave Mustaine & Lars Ulrich Leads To METALLICA's No Life Til Leather Reissue Being Shelved|website=Metalinjection.net |date=November 30, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://arrowlordsofmetal.nl/publishing-discrepancy-led-to-shelving-of-no-life-til-leather/|title=DAVE MUSTAINE says 'publishing discrepancy' led to shelving of METALLICA's expanded 'No Life 'Til Leather' release|website=Arrowlordsofmetal.nl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metaledgemag.com/metal-wire/dave-mustaine-on-metallica-i-wrote-many-of-the-songs-that-made-you-famous|title=Dave Mustaine on Metallica: 'I wrote many of the songs that made you famous'|website=Metaledgemag.com}}</ref>

===Mötley Crüe===
Often clashing during the early 1980s, both bands were fighting for dominance in the [[Los Angeles]] rock scene during Metallica's early years prior to their relocation to the Bay Area. Both James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich expressed their hatred of the hair metal scene in Los Angeles during the time and frequently attacked multiple up-and-coming local bands in multiple interviews, including [[Mötley Crüe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxrcfRrNwnw|title=Metallica on the '80s Metal Bands They Didn't Get Along With|website=[[YouTube]]|date=August 17, 2020|access-date=February 2, 2024|archive-date=March 30, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230330040214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxrcfRrNwnw|url-status=live}}</ref> Ulrich and Mötley Crüe's bassist [[Nikki Sixx]] had allegedly been involved in a spat prior to a show at the [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|Troubadour]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] in 1982. Though despite their public disdain for glam metal, Metallica were impressed by the production and commercial success of ''[[Dr. Feelgood (album)|Dr. Feelgood]]'' in 1989, later hiring the album's producer [[Bob Rock]] to produce their [[Metallica (album)|self-titled fifth album]] in 1991. Several years later; both Sixx and Ulrich would reignite the feud after Ulrich accused Mötley Crüe of performing to a backing track at the [[American Music Awards of 1997|1997 American Music Awards]]. Sixx responded via an online forum in which he insulted numerous band members and also attacked Metallica's then-recent album ''[[Load (album)|Load]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockcelebrities.net/how-the-feud-between-metallicas-lars-ulrich-and-motley-crues-nikki-sixx-started/|title=How The Feud Between Metallica's Lars Ulrich And Mötley Crüe's Nikki Sixx Started|date=July 3, 2021|access-date=February 2, 2024|archive-date=April 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412185409/https://rockcelebrities.net/how-the-feud-between-metallicas-lars-ulrich-and-motley-crues-nikki-sixx-started/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grunge.com/258187/the-truth-about-nicki-sixxs-feud-with-metallica/|title=The Truth About Nikki Sixx's Feud with Metallica|date=October 7, 2020|access-date=February 2, 2024|archive-date=April 16, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230416174314/https://www.grunge.com/258187/the-truth-about-nicki-sixxs-feud-with-metallica/|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite this, Sixx would praise Metallica's then-latest album ''[[St. Anger]]'' during a 2003 interview, contrary to the negative attention it received upon release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/m-tley-cr-e-bassist-defends-metallica-i-have-learned-to-have-sympathy-for-the-enemy|title=Crue Bassist Defends Metallica|date=June 2, 2003|access-date=February 2, 2024|archive-date=April 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412185407/https://blabbermouth.net/news/m-tley-cr-e-bassist-defends-metallica-i-have-learned-to-have-sympathy-for-the-enemy|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2006, both Mötley Crüe drummer [[Tommy Lee]], and former bassist Jason Newsted took part in a reality show titled ''[[Rock Star: Supernova]]'' as they would both participate in creating a supergroup while the show's premise revolved around finding a frontman via contest. During a 2011 meet-and-greet in [[Mexico City]], Hetfield was approached by a fan attacking Mötley Crüe due to their public image and frequent appearances in tabloids. Hetfield refused to directly respond to the fan's comments towards Mötley Crüe but laughed in his insults toward the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUsFrHvJX_0|title=JAMES HETFIELD MEETS A MOTLEY CRUE HATER (GETS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE/CRINGY)|website=[[YouTube]]|date=November 24, 2020|access-date=February 2, 2024|archive-date=April 14, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414003354/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUsFrHvJX_0|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2015, drummer Lee reignited the feud when he tweeted a picture of Ulrich with the words "Straight Outta Tempo" superimposed over his face. Following the post by Lee, Mötley Crüe singer [[Vince Neil]] had stated online that he was unaware of the feud with Metallica; however, during a later interview with an [[Oregon]] radio show, Neil was again asked about the band's current relationship with Metallica and hung up on the show's host.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.contactmusic.com/vince-neil/news/vince-neil-hangs-up-on-radio-host-over-motley-crue-metallica-feud-questions_4951062|title=Vince Neil Hangs Up On Radio Host Over Motley Crue/metallica Feud Questions|date=September 30, 2015|access-date=February 2, 2024|archive-date=April 14, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414001449/https://www.contactmusic.com/vince-neil/news/vince-neil-hangs-up-on-radio-host-over-motley-crue-metallica-feud-questions_4951062|url-status=live}}</ref> Things were alleged to have calmed down by 2017, when Hetfield appeared on Sixx's radio show ''Sixx Sense''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsYmjoHZZTc|title=Deeper With Metallica's James Hetfield (AUDIO)|website=[[YouTube]]|date=July 12, 2017|access-date=February 2, 2024|archive-date=April 14, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230414002522/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsYmjoHZZTc&gl=US&hl=en|url-status=live}}</ref> During an interview in 2021, Sixx applauded Metallica's longevity and praised several of their releases during an interview.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockcelebrities.net/nikki-sixx-discusses-metallicas-success-by-recalling-a-stunning-james-hetfield-moment/|title=Nikki Sixx Discusses Metallica's Success By Recalling A Stunning James Hetfield Moment|date=October 11, 2021|access-date=February 2, 2024|archive-date=April 12, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412185409/https://rockcelebrities.net/nikki-sixx-discusses-metallicas-success-by-recalling-a-stunning-james-hetfield-moment/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Jason Newsted===
Following his hiring in 1986, former bassist [[Jason Newsted]] had regularly experienced incidents of hazing and a perceived lack of acceptance from his bandmates despite his strong efforts in a majority of the band's live performances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guitar.com/news/music-news/my-strength-in-metallica-jason-newsted-live-shows/|title="My forte, my strength in Metallica in my time, was the live show… Everything else came second": Jason Newsted on what he brought to the Metallica table|website=Guitar.com &#124; All Things Guitar|access-date=February 2, 2024|archive-date=February 2, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240202011905/https://guitar.com/news/music-news/my-strength-in-metallica-jason-newsted-live-shows/|url-status=live}}</ref> Many fans and outlets cite the band's [[...And Justice for All (album)|fourth album]]'s unusual mixing to drown the bass tracks as a possible effort by Hetfield and Ulrich to minimize Newsted's involvement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/news/jason-newsted-livid-and-justice-for-all|title=Jason Newsted says he was "f*cking livid" when he first heard …And Justice For All|date=August 30, 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsK_UsOP41Tx79WsVHL0E2A|title=The Pit|website=YouTube}}</ref> This sentiment was further exacerbated by the fact that Newsted was only given songwriting credits on three songs during his 14-year span in the band which also saw him perform on four studio albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ultimatemetallica.com/jason-newsted-biography/|title=JASON NEWSTED – BIOGRAPHY|date=October 12, 2011 }}</ref> Tensions between Hetfield and Newsted reached a breaking point in 2000 after Hetfield repeatedly blocked Newsted's request to venture into his side project [[Echobrain]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71055/newsted-makes-peace-with-metallica-past |title=Newsted Makes Peace With Metallica Past |magazine=Billboard |access-date=January 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rollingstoneindia.com/the-return-of-jason-newsted/ |title=The Return of Jason Newsted |publisher=Rolling Stone India |date=February 12, 2013 |access-date=February 10, 2014}}</ref> Discussions broke down and Newsted abruptly left the band in January 2001 prior to the recording of ''[[St. Anger]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jason-newsted-metallica-fight/ |title=Jason Newsted Reveals 'Very Origins' of His Beef With Metallica|date=April 28, 2022 }}</ref> Despite Newsted's animosity surrounding his decision, he was later inducted into the hall of fame as a member of the band in 2009 and also appeared at the band's 30th anniversary show in San Francisco in 2011.
