'''Rammstein''' ({{IPA|de|ˈʁamʃtaɪn|}}, {{lit}} "ramming stone") is a German {{Lang|de|[[Neue Deutsche Härte]]|italic=no}} band formed in [[Berlin]] in 1994. The band's lineup—consisting of lead vocalist [[Till Lindemann]], lead guitarist [[Richard Kruspe]], rhythm guitarist [[Paul Landers]], bassist [[Oliver Riedel]], drummer [[Christoph Schneider]], and keyboardist [[Christian Lorenz|Christian "Flake" Lorenz]]—has remained unchanged throughout their history, along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with the [[punk rock]] acts [[Feeling B]] and [[First Arsch]].

After winning a local contest, Rammstein was able to record [[Demo (music)|demos]] and send them to different record labels, eventually signing with [[Motor Music]]. Working with producer [[Jacob Hellner]], they released their debut album ''[[Herzeleid]]'' in 1995. Though the album initially sold poorly, the band gained popularity through their live performances and the album eventually reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second album, ''[[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|Sehnsucht]]'', was released in 1997 and debuted at No. 1 in Germany, resulting in a worldwide tour lasting nearly four years and spawning the successful singles "[[Engel (song)|Engel]]" and "[[Du hast]]" and the live album ''[[Live aus Berlin]]'' (1999). Following the tour, Rammstein signed with major label [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] and released ''[[Mutter (album)|Mutter]]'' in 2001. Six singles were released from the album, all charting in countries throughout Europe. The lead single, "[[Sonne (Rammstein song)|Sonne]]", reached No. 2 in Germany. Rammstein released ''[[Reise, Reise]]'' in 2004 and had two more singles reach No. 2 in Germany: "[[Mein Teil]]" and "[[Amerika (song)|Amerika]]"; the former song reached No. 1 in Spain, becoming their first No. 1 single.

Their fifth album, ''[[Rosenrot]]'', was released in 2005, and the lead single, "[[Benzin]]", reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second live album, ''[[Völkerball]]'', was released in 2006. The band released their sixth album, ''[[Liebe ist für alle da]]'', in 2009, with its lead single, "[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]", becoming their first No. 1 hit in Germany despite having a controversial music video that featured [[hardcore pornography]]. The band then entered a recording hiatus and toured for several years, releasing the ''[[Made in Germany 1995–2011|Made in Germany]]'' greatest hits album as well as the ''[[Rammstein in Amerika]]'' and ''[[Rammstein: Paris|Paris]]'' live albums. After a decade without new music, Rammstein returned in 2019 with the song "[[Deutschland (song)|Deutschland]]", which became their second No. 1 hit in Germany. Their [[Untitled Rammstein album|untitled seventh studio album]] was released in May 2019 and reached No. 1 in 14 countries. While sheltering during [[COVID-19 pandemic in Germany|COVID-19]] [[COVID-19 lockdowns|lockdown]]s, the band spontaneously wrote and recorded their eighth studio album, ''[[Zeit (Rammstein album)|Zeit]]'', which was released in April 2022.

Rammstein was one of the first bands to emerge within the {{Lang|de|Neue Deutsche Härte|italic=no}} genre, with their debut album leading the music press to coin the term, and their style of music has generally had a positive reception from music critics. Commercially, the band has been very successful, earning many No. 1 albums as well as gold and platinum certifications in countries around the world. Their grand live performances, which often feature [[pyrotechnics]], have contributed to the growth in their popularity. Despite success, the band has been subject to some controversies, with their overall image having been criticized; for instance, the song "[[Ich tu dir weh]]" forced its parent album ''Liebe ist für alle da'' to be placed on the "index" maintained by the German [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons|Federal Review Board for Media Harmful to Minors]] and re-released in Germany with the song removed due to its sexually explicit lyrics.

In 1989, [[East German]] guitarist [[Richard Kruspe]] escaped to [[West Berlin]] and started the band Orgasm Death Gimmick. At that time, he was heavily influenced by US music, especially of  hard rock band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. After the [[Berlin Wall]] came down, he moved back home to [[Schwerin]], where [[Till Lindemann]] worked as a [[basket weaving|basket-weaver]] and played drums in the band [[First Arsch]] (loosely translated as "First Arse" or "First Ass"). At this time, Kruspe lived with [[Oliver Riedel]] of [[The Inchtabokatables]] and [[Christoph Schneider]] of Die Firma.

In 1992, Kruspe made his first trip to the United States with Till Lindemann and Oliver "Ollie" Riedel. He realized that he did not want to make US music and concentrated on creating a unique German sound. Kruspe, Riedel and Schneider started working together on a new project in 1993. Finding it difficult to write both music and lyrics, Kruspe persuaded Lindemann, whom he had overheard singing while he was working, to join the fledgling group.

The band co-existed with the members' previous projects for about a year and a half. Members would invest the money raised with Feeling B shows in new project. They recorded their first songs in a building that had been [[Squatting|squatted]] by Feeling B frontman [[Aljoscha Rompe]].<ref name="MHfeature"/> A contest was held in Berlin for amateur bands in 1994, the winner of which would receive access to a professional recording studio<ref name="MHfeature"/> for a whole week. Kruspe, Riedel, Schneider, and Lindemann entered and won the contest with a 4-track demo tape with demo versions of songs from ''Herzeleid'', written in English. This sparked Paul Landers' attention, who wanted in on the project upon hearing their demo. To complete their sound, Rammstein attempted to recruit [[Christian Lorenz|Christian "Flake" Lorenz]], who had played with Landers in [[Feeling B]]. Though initially hesitant, Lorenz eventually agreed to join the band.

Up to that point, the band was called Tempelprayers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rammstein: Sons of East German punk – DW – 07/26/2019 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/rammstein-sons-of-east-german-punk/a-49746002 |access-date=2024-04-16 |website=dw.com |language=en}}</ref> The name Rammstein comes from an early idea of Schneider, Flake and Paul.

Later, Rammstein was signed by [[Motor Music]].<ref name="MHfeature"/> Rammstein began to record their first studio album, ''[[Herzeleid]]'', in March 1995 with producer [[Jacob Hellner]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rammstein.com/_Voelkerball/Band/Timeline/T1995/ |title= Rammstein :: Band :: Timeline |access-date= 21 June 2008 |publisher= Rammstein.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080613205805/http://www.rammstein.com/_Voelkerball/Band/Timeline/T1995/ |archive-date= 13 June 2008}}</ref> They released their first single "[[Du riechst so gut]]" that August and released the album in September.

This helped to boost the band's popularity and establish them as a credible live act. They went on several tours throughout early 1996, releasing their second single titled "[[Seemann (Rammstein song)|Seemann]]" on 8 January. On 27 March 1996, Rammstein performed on [[MTV]]'s ''Hanging Out'' in London, their first performance in the UK. Their first major boost in popularity outside Germany came when [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]] chose two Rammstein songs, "Heirate mich" and "[[Rammstein (song)|Rammstein]]", during his work as music director for the [[David Lynch]] 1997 film ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]''.<ref name="MHfeature"/> The soundtrack for the film was released in the U.S. in late 1996 and later throughout Europe in April 1997. In the middle of 1996, they headlined one tour of their own in small, sold-out venues.<ref name="MHfeature"/> Rammstein went on to tour through Germany, Austria, and Switzerland from September to October 1996, performing an anniversary concert on 27 September called "100 years of Rammstein". Guests to the concert included [[Moby]], [[Bobo (singer)|Bobo]], and the Berlin Session Orchestra, while Berlin director Gert Hof was responsible for the light show.

===''Sehnsucht'' and ''Live aus Berlin'' (1996–2000)===
{{Main|Sehnsucht (Rammstein album){{!}}''Sehnsucht'' (Rammstein album)|Live aus Berlin{{!}}''Live aus Berlin''}}
Rammstein started recording ''[[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|Sehnsucht]]'' in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rammstein.com/_Voelkerball/Band/Timeline/T1996/ |title= Rammstein :: Band :: Timeline |access-date= 21 June 2008 |publisher= Rammstein.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080613205810/http://www.rammstein.com/_Voelkerball/Band/Timeline/T1996/ |archive-date= 13 June 2008}}</ref> The album was again produced by [[Jacob Hellner]]. "[[Engel (song)|Engel]]", the first single from the album, was released on 1 April 1997 and reached gold status in Germany on 23 May. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, named ''Engel – Fan Edition''. This contained two previously unreleased songs, "Feuerräder" and "Wilder Wein". Release of the second single from the album ''Sehnsucht'' was "[[Du hast]]", which hit the German single charts in August 1997 at No. 5. Rammstein then continued touring in the summer while ''Sehnsucht'' was released on 22 August 1997. The album reached No. 1 in Germany after two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, ''Herzeleid'' and both ''Sehnsucht'' singles ("Du hast" and "Engel") were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold-out shows throughout Europe in September and October. On 5 December 1997, they embarked on their first tour of the United States as the opening act for [[KMFDM]]. In July 1998, the band released a cover of the song "[[Stripped (song)|Stripped]]", originally released by Depeche Mode in early 1986; it was included on the tribute album ''[[For the Masses]]'', the Rammstein version obtained moderate success in Germany and Austria.

On 22–23 August 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin, the biggest show the band had played there up to that date. Supporting acts were [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Joachim Witt]] and [[Alaska (singer)|Alaska]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rammstein.de/en/rammstein |title= History-Rammstein |access-date= 26 March 2015 |publisher= Rammstein.de |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150327020900/http://www.rammstein.de/en/rammstein |archive-date=27 March 2015}}</ref> The show was professionally filmed, intended to be released on their upcoming [[Live album|live]] DVD, ''[[Live aus Berlin]]''. Rammstein embarked on a live tour with [[Korn]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Orgy (band)|Orgy]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] called the [[Family Values Tour]] in September through to late October 1998. Continuing their success in the US, ''Sehnsucht'' received Gold record status there on 2 November. The band was nominated at the [[MTV European Music Awards]] for ''Best Rock Act'' and performed "Du hast" live on 12 November that year.

Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting in February with a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] at the [[41st Annual Grammy Awards]]. A year after it was filmed, the ''Live aus Berlin'' concert was released on CD on 30 August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, ''Live aus Berlin'' went to No. 2 in the German Album Charts. On 13 September and 26 November 1999, the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively.

The music video for "Pussy" was released on 16 September 2009, at 20:30 GMT, released especially for the adult website Visit-x.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visit-x.net/rammstein |title=Rammstein presents Pussy |access-date=16 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124164141/http://www.visit-x.net/rammstein |archive-date=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The video contains graphic scenes of male and female nudity as well as women engaging in sexual acts with the band members, although the actual sex scenes were performed by body doubles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.20min.ch/unterhaltung/sounds/story/28765113 |title=Rammstein: "Wir hatten keinen Sex" |website=[[20 Minuten]]|date=14 October 2009}}</ref> The women featured in the video are German pornographic stars.<ref name="Hustler">{{cite web |title=Rammstein |work=Hustler Magazine |url=http://www.hustlermagazine.com/features/band-interviews/rammstein |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929015329/http://www.hustlermagazine.com/features/band-interviews/rammstein |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 September 2010}}</ref> [[Metal Hammer]] released an edited version of the video onto their website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/the-rammstein-video-described-for-those-at-work/|title=Metal Hammer Work Safe 'Pussy' synopsis The Rammstein video described for those at work|access-date=8 September 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925211502/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/the-rammstein-video-described-for-those-at-work/|archive-date=25 September 2010}}</ref>

"[[Ich tu dir weh]]" was confirmed as the second single from the album by Landers and Lorenz in an interview for Radio Eins. Although censorship of the song in Germany prohibits any advertisement, broadcast or public display, the video to "Ich tu dir weh" was released on 21 December 2009 on the adult website Visit-x, just like the video to "Pussy", after advertisement on the band's official German website; it depicts the band on stage in a similar configuration as on their 2009/10 tour. Any references to the video on the official website have since been deleted. In Europe, the single was released on 15 January 2010, and in the U.S. on 19 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rammstein-austria.com |title=Die Rammsteinseite Nr.1 |publisher=Rammstein Austria |access-date=21 July 2011}}</ref> Like the video "Pussy," this video was also directed by [[Jonas Åkerlund]]. On 23 April 2010, Rammstein released their video "[[Haifisch]]" on the band's [[Myspace|MySpace]] page.

As part of their European summer tour, Rammstein performed at the [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park|2010 Rock AM Ring Festival]] on 4–6 June 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/rammstein-confirmed-for-rock-am-ring/ |title=Rammstein confirmed for Rock am Ring |publisher=Metalhammer.co.uk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610173043/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/rammstein-confirmed-for-rock-am-ring/ |archive-date=10 June 2013}}</ref> They also headlined several shows across Europe on the [[Sonisphere Festival]], including their first ever outdoor UK performance at [[Knebworth Park]], performing the day before [[Iron Maiden]]. On Sunday 18 July 2010, Rammstein played in front of more than 130,000 people in [[Quebec City]] on the [[Plains of Abraham]] as the closing show for the [[Festival d'été de Québec]]. It was their first North American appearance in nine years. The band announced that their last tour dates of 2010 were to be in the Americas. After several South American dates, the band returned to the United States for a single show at the famous [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City – their first US show in over ten years. The tickets sold out in a very short time (under 20 minutes).

They also performed at [[Bell Centre]] in Montreal, Canada on 9 December. This concert sold out within the first hour of tickets going on sale, indicating a high demand to see Rammstein in North America. The band then played at Big Day Out 2011 from 21 January to 6 February in New Zealand and Australia. The band also visited South Africa for the first time in early 2011 and played two sold-out concerts in Cape Town and Johannesburg respectively, indicating another territory eager for the opportunity to enjoy the band live. On 16 February 2011, Rammstein announced that, after the massive success of their sold out [[Madison Square Garden]] show on 11 December 2010, they would be touring North America after ten years.

Rammstein played in New Jersey (East Rutherford) [[Izod Center]], Montreal [[Bell Centre]], Toronto [[Air Canada Centre]], Chicago [[Allstate Arena]], Edmonton [[Rexall Place]], Seattle [[Tacoma Dome]], San Francisco (Oakland) [[Oracle Arena]], Los Angeles [[The Forum (Inglewood)|The Forum]], and Las Vegas [[Thomas and Mack Center]], Mexico City's [[Palacio de los Deportes]], Guadalajara's [[Arena VFG]], and Monterrey's Auditorio Banamex to a total of six US dates, three Canadian dates, and four Mexican dates. Tickets went on sale 25 and 26 February to great response, with many shows completely selling out, making this tour a complete success. On 20 April 2011, the band also won the [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver Golden God Award]] for Best Live Band, their first US award.

Rammstein was traditionally inspired by bands such as the Slovenian group ''[[Laibach]]'', known for its provocative songs, often citing political symbols of the far-right<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richter |first1=Peter |title=Frühsport bei Tiffany |journal=Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung |date=2010 |issue=50 |page=27}}</ref> and whose music style also combines different genres, or the German rock band [[Oomph!]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Biografie der Band Oomph! |url=https://www.laut.de/Oomph! |website=laut.de |access-date=6 October 2022}}</ref> However, the band members do not see a real connection to ''Laibach'' – apart from the similarity in vocal style which Flake Lorenz admitted in a ''[[VIVA (German TV channel)|Viva]]'' interview from 1997. In the same interview Richard Kruspe said: "For me, ''Laibach'' is a very, very intellectual story. Rammstein is much more emotional for me – in the beginning. And I can't do anything with that intellect that ''Laibach'' uses."<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK8EQqH1IM8&t=1552s ''Viva Jam: Rammstein''], Folge 176, 1997; retrieved via youtube.com 26 February 2017.</ref>

Unlike many bands from Berlin in the early 1990s, Rammstein did not want to imitate American or English bands. Flake Lorenz said in an interview: "We found the style by knowing exactly what we didn't want. And we just didn't want to do American funky music or punk or anything we can't do. We realized that we can only do this music that we also play. And it's just very simple, dull, monotone."<ref name="ZDF">Interview on ZDF with Rammstein from 199?, from ''Live aus Berlin'' (1999).</ref>

Rammstein's style has received positive feedback from critics. New Zealand's ''[[The Southland Times|Southland Times]]'' (17 December 1999) suggested that Till Lindemann's "booming, sub-sonic voice" would send "the peasants fleeing into their barns and bolting their doors", while ''[[The New York Times]]'' (9 January 2005) commented that on the stage, "Mr. Lindemann gave off an air of such brute masculinity and barely contained violence that it seemed that he could have reached into the crowd, snatched up a fan, and bitten off his head". [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] commented that "their blend of industrial noise, grinding metal guitars, and operatic vocals is staggeringly powerful".<ref name="Allmusic.com-sehnsucht">{{cite web |title=SEHNSUCHT – Rammstein |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |website=[[AllMusic]] |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sehnsucht-mw0000031603 |access-date=10 July 2006}}</ref> "We just push boundaries", said Till Lindemann in an interview with rock magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'', "We cannot help it if people don't like those boundaries being pushed".

Nearly all of Rammstein's songs are in German. Educated in East German schools, the members were all taught Russian as a second language rather than English. In 2019, Flake commented: "I saw a lot of East German bands that sung in very bad English to people who didn't understand English – it was absolutely stupid. But if you really want to tell your emotions, you have to speak in your mother tongue."<ref name="MHfeature"/> Songs they have recorded entirely or partly in English include: a cover of [[Depeche Mode]]'s 1986 song "[[Stripped (song)|Stripped]]" and English renditions of "[[Engel (song)|Engel]]", "[[Du hast]]", and "[[Amerika (song)|Amerika]]". The original version of "Amerika" as well as "Stirb nicht vor mir (Don't Die Before I Do)" and "Pussy" also contain some lyrics in English. The song "[[Moskau (Rammstein song)|Moskau]]" ("Moscow") contains a chorus in Russian, and Till Lindemann has an unofficial song called "[[Shtil (Calm)|Schtiel]]" (cover of song "Штиль" / "Shtil" by Russian popular heavy metal band [[Aria (band)|Aria]]) entirely in Russian.<ref name="auto">{{cite news |title =''Sunday Herald Sun'', Melbourne, Australia |newspaper= Sunday Herald Sun}}</ref> "[[Te quiero puta]]!" is entirely in Spanish, "Frühling in Paris" has a chorus in French, "Zeig dich" contains lyrics in Latin performed by a choir and "Ausländer" has lyrics in English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian. Oliver Riedel commented that "[the] German language suits heavy metal music. French might be the language of love, but German is the language of anger".<ref name="auto"/> In an interview with Ultimate Guitar, when asked whether Rammstein would ever create an original song entirely in English, Till Lindemann stated that 'Rammstein will never write a song in English, it's like asking Buddha to kill a pig'.<ref name="Ultimate Guitar">{{cite web |title= Till Lindemann: 'Rammstein Will Never Write a Song in English, It's Like Asking Buddha to Kill a Pig' |publisher= Ultimate Guitar |url= http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/till_lindemann_rammstein_will_never_write_a_song_in_english_its_like_asking_buddha_to_kill_a_pig.html |access-date= 22 July 2015}}</ref>

The band's lyrics, as sung by Till Lindemann, are an essential element of their music, and shape the perception by fans and a wider public. Among other things that are seen as controversial, Rammstein also refers to classical German literature, e.g. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's famous poems ''[[Der Erlkönig]]'' (1778) and ''[[Heidenröslein|Das Heidenröslein]]'' (1771) for the songs "Dalai Lama" and "Rosenrot", respectively.<ref>''Lüke'', Lüke, Martina. "Modern Classics: Reflections on Rammstein in the German Class". Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German 41:1 (Spring 2008): 15–23.</ref> Several of their songs are related to controversial and taboo subjects such as [[sadomasochism]] ("Weisses Fleisch", "[[Bück dich]]", "Rein raus" and "[[Ich tu dir weh]]"), [[homosexuality]] ([[Mann gegen Mann]]), [[intersex]]uality ("Zwitter"), [[incest]] ("Laichzeit", "Tier", "Spiel mit mir" and "Wiener Blut"), [[pedophilia]] ("Weisses Fleisch", "Tier", "Halleluja" and "Hallomann"), [[necrophilia]] ("Heirate mich"), [[zoophilia]] ("Laichzeit"), [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]] ("Mein Teil"), [[pyromania]] ("[[Benzin]]" and "Hilf mir"), [[religion]] ("[[Asche zu Asche]]", "Engel", "Bestrafe mich" and "Zeig dich") and [[sexual violence]] ("Wollt ihr das Bett in Flammen sehen", "Rein raus" "Stein um Stein" and "Liebe ist für alle da"). Also several of their songs are allegedly inspired by real-life events. These songs include "Rammstein" ([[Ramstein air show disaster]]), "Mein Teil" ([[Armin Meiwes|The Meiwes Case]]), "Wiener Blut" ([[Fritzl case]]) and "Donaukinder" ([[2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill]]). Their fourth album, ''Reise, Reise'', is loosely inspired by the crash of [[Japan Air Lines Flight 123]].<ref name="Metal Hammer">{{Cite magazine |last=Daly |first=Joe |date=1 May 2019 |title=Rammstein – The Ultimate Celebration – Bang Bangers! |magazine=[[Metal Hammer|Metal Hammer UK]] |page=55}}</ref> The band have also occasionally delved into politics with their lyrics. "Amerika" is a critique of the cultural and political imperialism of the United States all over the world. The lyrics of the song "[[Deutschland (song)|Deutschland]]" contain the lines "Deutschland! / Meine Liebe / kann ich dir nicht geben" (Germany! / My love / [is what] I cannot give you), which conveys the band's inability to have unquestioned patriotic feelings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=genius.com |title=Rammstein – DEUTSCHLAND (English Translation) |url=https://genius.com/16826344 |website=Genius.com |access-date=4 April 2019}}</ref>

==Live performances==
[[File:Rammstein Nottingham.jpg|thumb|left|Rammstein are known for their frequent use of [[pyrotechnics]] during live performances.]]

Since their early years,<ref name="MHfeature"/> Rammstein are particularly known for their over-the-top live performances, making such extensive use of [[pyrotechnics]] that fans eventually coined the motto, "Other bands play, Rammstein burns!" (a play on [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]]'s song "Kings of Metal", which states that "other bands play, Manowar kill"). Following an accident in Berlin on 27 September 1996, in which some burning decorative parts of the stage collapsed,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://rammstein-europe.com/main.php?sekce=till-lindemann&l=en |title= Till Lindemann Biography |access-date= 10 May 2007 |publisher= Rammstein-Europe.com |archive-date= 1 July 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070701191646/http://www.rammstein-europe.com/main.php?sekce=till-lindemann&l=en |url-status= dead}}</ref> the band started using professionals to handle the pyrotechnics. Lindemann subsequently qualified as a licensed pyrotechnician, and often spends entire songs engulfed in flames. He has suffered multiple burns on his ears, head, and arms.

The band's stage costumes are also known for being outlandish. During the Reise, Reise Tour, they wore [[lederhosen]], [[corset]]s, and military-inspired uniforms with [[stahlhelm|German steel helmets]]; during the Mutter Tour, the group kept to the themes of the album artwork and descended onto the stage from a giant [[uterus]] while wearing diapers. During the ''Völkerball'' concert, among others, Lindemann changed costumes between songs and dressed accordingly for each. For example, for the song "Mein Teil", he was dressed as a blood-soaked chef; in "Reise, Reise", he dressed as a sailor. The rest of the band each wore their own preferred costume, but none quite as bizarre as Till's. The band's flair for costumes is evident in their music videos as well as their live shows. In the "Keine Lust" video, all members except Lorenz are dressed in fat suits. In the "Amerika" video, all members of the band wear astronaut costumes.

Since the Mutter Tour in 2001, Rammstein have worked with stage designer Roy Bennett, who helped the band in developing the look of the stages. With the Ahoi Tour in 2004/2005, the band began using a two-level stage, with half the band playing the lower level and the other half on the upper level. At this tour, the upper level rose over 2 meters above the stage floor and had an oval entrance just beneath the drums. At both sides of the upper level, a special lift made it possible for the band members to access both stage levels.

[[File:Till-Lindemann.jpg|thumb|[[Till Lindemann]] performing "[[Rammstein (song)|Rammstein]]", during which he wears dual arm-mounted flamethrowers]]

On the [[Liebe ist für alle da Tour]] in 2009, the new stage still had a two-level design. This time, however, the upper level only had about half the height as on the previous tour. Stage entrance was possible by a hydraulic ramp in the middle of the stage floor. At each end of the upper level, stairs were placed in order to gain access to both levels. This tour included not only the extensive use of pyrotechnics, but also a massive lighting show, such as the band's logo lit up as big lamps on four enormous collapsible towers, forming the industrial backdrop of the set and being capable of different lighting effects.

During the arena shows of the [[Made in Germany 1995-2011 Tour]], the stage was slightly altered with new set pieces such as a large industrial fan as well as new backdrops. The most noticeable addition was a long catwalk, connecting the main stage to a smaller stage in the middle of the audience. During the 2013 festival leg of the tour, the bridge and smaller stage were omitted. For the 2016 Festival Tour, the band kept the stage itself mostly unchanged, though had the entire lighting rig changed completely. According to Kruspe, the onstage antics are meant to get people's attention and have fun at the same time; Rammstein's motto, according to Schneider, is "do your own thing and overdo it".

Kruspe said of the stage show in July 1999, "You have to understand that 99 per cent of the people don't understand the lyrics, so you have to come up with something to keep the drama in the show. We have to do something. We like to have a show; we like to play with fire. We do have a sense of humour. We do laugh about it; we have fun [...] but we're not [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]. We take the music and the lyrics seriously. It's a combination of humour, theatre, and our [[East German]] culture, you know?"<ref>{{cite news |title=The Grand Rapids Press |date= 22 July 1999 |newspaper= Grand Rapids Press}}</ref>

Their antics have also garnered controversy. During the American [[Family Values Tour]] 1998, alongside acts such as rapper [[Ice Cube]], [[Korn]], and [[Limp Bizkit]], the band was arrested for [[public indecency]]. In one of their more infamous moments, Lindemann engaged in simulated [[sodomy]] with Lorenz during their performance of "Bück dich" in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. They were subsequently arrested, fined $25 and spent one night in jail.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kratina |first=Al |title=Concert review: Rammstein |url=https://montrealgazette.com/Concert+review+Rammstein/3959185/story.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213202756/http://www.montrealgazette.com/Concert%2Breview%2BRammstein/3959185/story.html |archive-date=13 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location=Montreal |date=10 December 2010 |access-date=22 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Steffen|first=Chris|title=Behind the Scenes: Rammstein Live|url=https://www.spin.com/2010/12/behind-scenes-rammstein-live/|access-date=22 December 2010|newspaper=Spin|date=8 December 2010}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Imagery===
''The New York Times'' described Rammstein's music as a "powerful strain of brutally intense rock... bringing gale-force music and spectacular theatrics together".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=184439 |title= NYTimes Movies |access-date= 10 April 2007 |work=The New York Times |first=Manohla |last=Dargis}}{{Dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> The members have not been shy about courting controversy and have periodically attracted condemnation from [[morality]] campaigners. Till and Flake's stage act earned them a night in jail in June 1999 after a liquid-ejecting [[dildo]] was used in a concert in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. Back home in Germany, the band faced repeated accusations of fascist sympathies because of the dark and sometimes [[Militarism|militaristic]] imagery of their videos and concerts, including the use of excerpts from the film ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'' by [[Leni Riefenstahl]] in the video for their cover of Depeche Mode's song "Stripped". [[MTV Germany]] studied the lyrics, talked to the band and came away satisfied that Rammstein are apolitical; Peter Ruppert, then head of Music Programming at MTV Germany, stated that the band "aren't in any way connected with any right-wing activities".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.helnwein.com/news/update/artikel_3108.html |title=German Band's Fierce Songs Taking US by Storm (Press) |publisher=Helnwein.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906200325/http://www.helnwein.com/news/update/artikel_3108.html |archive-date=6 September 2008}}</ref>

Their cover of their debut album ''Herzeleid'', released in Germany in 1995, showed the band members bare-chested in a style that resembled [[Strength Through Joy]] in the eyes of some critics, who accused the band of trying to sell themselves as "poster boys for the [[Master Race]]".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://herzeleid.com/en/faq/band |title= Herzeleid.com (FAQ) |access-date= 10 April 2007 |publisher= Herzeleid.com |archive-date= 7 December 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171207140305/http://herzeleid.com/en/faq/band |url-status= dead}}</ref> Rammstein have vehemently denied this and said they want nothing to do with politics or supremacy of any kind. Lorenz, annoyed by the claim, has remarked it is just a photo, and should be understood as such. ''Herzeleid'' has since been given a different cover in North America, depicting the band members' faces.

The video of "[[Deutschland (song)|Deutschland]]", released in 2019, sparked further controversy, as it portrays black German actress [[Ruby Commey]] appearing as [[Germania (personification)|Germania]], which has been described as "a calculated affront to German nationalists".<ref name="bloomberg-germania">{{cite news |last1=Bershidsky |first1=Leonid |title=What Has Rammstein Revealed About Germany's Soul? |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-02/rammstein-rock-video-sparks-debate-over-german-national-identity |website=[[Bloomberg News]] |access-date=22 September 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200519042220/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-02/rammstein-rock-video-sparks-debate-over-german-national-identity |archive-date=19 May 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The video also portrays the band members both as Nazi concentration camp executioners and as Jewish prisoners, sparking the complaints of [[Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]] groups; however, others defended the video and the song lyrics, which have been interpreted as "express[ing] a love/hate relationship with Germany".<ref name="metalsucks-deutschland">{{cite web |last1=Rosemberg |first1=Axl |title=Let's Talk About Rammstein's Controversial "Deutschland" Vide |url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2019/03/29/lets-talk-about-rammsteins-deutschland-video/ |website=Metal Sucks |date=29 March 2019 |access-date=22 September 2020}}</ref>

===Relation to violent events===
Rammstein were cited in relation to the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999, when a photo of [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Eric Harris]] wearing a Rammstein T-shirt in the 11th grade was revealed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://acolumbinesite.com/eric/pics/ericramm11th.jpg|title= Eric Harris wearing a Rammstein T-shirt |website= Acolumbinesite.com}}</ref> There was no evidence to correlate the band and the massacre. In response to the shooting, the band issued a statement:

{{blockquote|text=The members of Rammstein express their condolences and sympathy to all affected by the recent tragic events in Denver. They wish to make it clear that they have no lyrical content or political beliefs that could have possibly influenced such behaviour. Additionally, members of Rammstein have children of their own, in whom they continually strive to instill healthy and non-violent values.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://herzeleid.com/en/faq/misc|title= Did Rammstein's music cause Columbine?|website= Herzeleid.com|access-date= 4 December 2014|archive-date= 4 April 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080404201742/http://herzeleid.com/en/faq/misc|url-status= dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427256/kmfdm-rammstein-speak-out-about-columbine.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209222140/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427256/kmfdm-rammstein-speak-out-about-columbine.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 February 2012|title=KMFDM And Rammstein Speak Out About Columbine|publisher=MTV News}}</ref>}}

Coincidentally, on 10 September 2001 the single and video clip of "Ich will" ("I Want") was released, which portrays the band as bank robbers who want to get a message across and receiving a [[Goldene Kamera]] (Golden Camera) award, a German version of the Emmy award, for their "actions". In the United States, the video clip was broadcast only late at night after [[September 11 attacks|the attacks of 11 September 2001]], although many media officials and politicians requested the video to be pulled from broadcast completely.

Following the conclusion of the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]] in Russia in September 2004, the Russian authorities claimed that the terrorists had "listened to German hard rock group Rammstein on personal stereos during the siege to keep themselves edgy and fired up".<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=3601635|title= Beslan hostage-takers were all addicts says top Russian official|date= 18 October 2004}}</ref> The claim has not been independently confirmed.

Band members said this about the issue:

{{Blockquote|text=There's been a lot of talk about that, but if there are radical feelings in people anything can wake them – a painting, a picture, whatever. It's just a coincidence that it happened to be our music. It's important to think about what caused them to make their decisions, how they became animals, not their taste in music. Whenever something like this happens it's like 'Okay, let's blame the artist'. Such bullshit.|author=Till Lindemann}}

{{Blockquote|text=Our music is made to release aggression, and people listening to it are also needed to do that, but it's not our fault. Should we stop making hard music because bad people might like it?|author=Christoph Schneider}}

Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the perpetrator of the [[Jokela school shooting]] in November 2007, also included Rammstein in one of his favorite bands. However, he noted that the music among other things was not to blame for his decisions.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://oddculture.com/the-pekka-eric-auvinen-manifesto/ |title= The Pekka Eric Auvinen Manifesto|date= 7 November 2007 |website=Oddculture.com}}</ref>

[[Elliot Rodger]], the perpetrator of the [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]] in May 2014, was also a fan of Rammstein according to his YouTube records. On a lyric video of [[Mein Herz brennt]], Rodger wrote: "[G]reat song to listen to while daydreaming about being a powerful ruler". Even though Rodger wrote in his manifesto that he wished to become a dictator and punish all the people who rejected him, there was no direct link found between the band's music and the killing spree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1173808-elliot-rodger-manifesto.html/ |title=My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger|date= 23 May 2014 |website=Documentcloud.org}}</ref> Santa Barbara police later confirmed that Rodger's main motivations were sexual and social rejection.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/justice/california-elliot-rodger-timeline/ |title= Timeline to 'Retribution': Isla Vista attacks planned over year |date= 27 May 2014|publisher= CNN|first= Alan|last= Duke}}</ref>

The [[Trollhättan school attack]] perpetrator, Anton Lundin Pettersson, used a manipulated version of the band's logo that added [[Coat of arms of Germany#Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany's eagle]] on his Facebook page.

===Videos===
In October 2004, the video for "[[Mein Teil]]" ("My part") caused controversy in Germany when it was released. It takes a darkly comic view of the [[Armin Meiwes]] cannibalism case, showing a [[Cross dressing|cross-dressed]] [[Christoph Schneider|Schneider]] holding the other five band members on a leash and rolling around in mud.

The band's own views of its image are sanguine; Landers has said: "We like being on the fringes of bad taste".<ref>{{cite news|last= Smyth|first= David|date= 10 February 2012|title= Flame and glory: Rammstein set to light up London|url= https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/flame-and-glory-rammstein-set-to-light-up-london-7441820.html|newspaper= [[London Evening Standard]]|access-date= 21 January 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150121093526/http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/flame-and-glory-rammstein-set-to-light-up-london-7441820.html|archive-date= 21 January 2015|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Christian "Flake" Lorenz comments: "The controversy is fun, like stealing forbidden fruit.

The video for "Pussy" was released September 2009. It features hardcore pornographic scenes of [[nudity]] along with women engaging in sexual activity with body doubles of the band members.<ref>{{cite magazine |title= Rammstein's Pussy Released in Mucky Vid |magazine= The Quietus |date= 17 September 2009 |url= http://mp-3.net.ua/mysik/rock/930-rammstein-pussy.html |access-date= 17 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

===Placement on the ''Index''===
On 5 November 2009, their sixth studio album ''[[Liebe ist für alle da]]'' was placed on the ''Index'' of the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] (''Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien'', or ''BPjM''), making it illegal in Germany to make the album accessible to minors or display it where it can be seen by people underage, effectively banning it from stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Rammstein/|title=Rammstein|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://schnittberichte.com/news.php?ID=1693 |title=Report |publisher=Schnittberichte.com}}</ref> According to the official statement of the BPjM, the depiction of lead guitarist Richard Kruspe holding a woman wearing only a mask over his knee and lifting his hand to strike her behind has given cause for offense, as well as the lyrics to "Ich tu dir weh" (meaning "I hurt you") which supposedly promoted dangerous [[BDSM]] techniques. Furthermore, the advisory board took into consideration the alleged promotion of unprotected sexual intercourse in the lyrics to "Pussy".

The band, as well as several members of the German press, reacted with astonishment to the decision. Keyboardist Christian Lorenz expressed surprise at the advisory board's "parochial sense of art" and regretted their apparent inability to detect irony.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/469/493812/text/ |title=Liebe ist nicht für alle da |work=Süddeutsche Zeitung |access-date=12 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112125016/http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/469/493812/text/ |archive-date=12 November 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/vorlaut/news/2009/11/11/23636/index.htm |title=Rammstein-Zensur: Mit Fleischgewehren auf Spatzen |publisher=Laut.de |access-date=8 September 2010|language=de}}</ref> On 16 November 2009, a stripped-down version of ''Liebe ist für alle da'' was released. As of 31 May 2010, the administrative court in Cologne had decided to suspend the inclusion into the ''Index'' (case 22 L 1899/09). The German department deleted the record from the ''Index'' on 1 June (Decision No. A 117/10). On 9 June, the band announced that the original version of the album was available in their shop and that the single "Ich tu dir weh" would soon be released in Germany. In October 2011, the album was judged not harmful to minors and deleted from the ''Index''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/urteil-zum-rammstein-album-liebe-ist-doch-fuer-alle-da-1.1172929 |title=Liebe ist doch für alle da |work=Süddeutsche Zeitung |date=25 October 2011 |access-date=29 July 2015}}</ref>

In 2016, Rammstein filed a lawsuit against the German state claiming €66,000 in compensation for damages that had allegedly resulted from the indexing, chiefly the destruction or withholding of 85,000 copies of the album that the band says would have otherwise sold.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rammstein sues Germany over indexed album |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=5 April 2016 |access-date=27 September 2016 |agency=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|dpa]] |url=http://dw.com/p/1IPZl}}</ref>

===Concert misconduct allegations===
In May 2023, a woman claimed that her drink was spiked (drugged) during a Rammstein concert in Lithuania and was selected for an aftershow party, during which she was ushered into a small room underneath the stage for lead singer Till Lindemann. After making herself unavailable for sex, she claimed Lindemann reacted angrily and left. While emphasising that she was never assaulted, she believed there to be an "organised system of funnelling girls."<ref name="bbc-08-06-2023">{{Cite news |date=8 June 2023 |title=Rammstein fan Shelby Lynn alleges she was groomed for sex |website=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-65843882 |access-date=8 June 2023}}</ref> Although Vilnius prosecutors found no evidence of drugging, her story amplified the band's "Row Zero" practice, where young women would be pre-selected on social media by casting director Alena Makeeva to stand in an exclusive area closest to the stage dubbed Row Zero and attend pre-show and after-show parties, during which Lindemann would request to have sex with fans in attendance.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rammstein won't be investigated in Lithuania – DW – 06/26/2023 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/rammstein-wont-be-investigated-in-lithuania/a-65991207 |access-date=23 July 2023 |website=dw.com |language=en}}</ref> Further claims against Lindemann prompted an investigation by German police for sexual offences and the distribution of narcotics.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Schuetze |first=Christopher F. |date=15 June 2023 |title=German Police Investigate Rammstein Singer Over Sexual Assault Accusations |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/15/arts/music/rammstein-singer-sexual-assault-accusations.html |access-date=23 July 2023 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In response, the band denied all claims of illegal behavior, fired Makeeva and halted the "Row Zero" afterparties.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Exberliner |date=7 June 2023 |title=Rammstein allegations mean no more "Row Zero" at Berlin concerts |url=https://www.exberliner.com/english-news-berlin/rammstein-allegations-mean-no-more-row-zero-at-berlin-concerts/ |access-date=23 July 2023 |website=Exberliner |language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=19 June 2023 |title=Rammstein scandal: casting director fired amidst abuse accusations |url=https://www.msn.com/en-sg/entertainment/news/rammstein-scandal-casting-director-fired-amidst-abuse-accusations/ss-AA1ccDUp |access-date= |website=www.msn.com}}</ref>

Early on, Rammstein were accused by media outlets in Germany of being [[neo-Nazi]]s due to their imagery. The band released the song "[[Links 2-3-4]]" (''Links'' being German for "left") in 2001 to affirm to the public that they reside on the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of the political spectrum. In a 2011 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone Germany]]'', when asked about Nazi accusations, Lindemann stated "We come from the East and we have grown up as [[Socialism|socialist]]s. We used to be either punks or Goths – we hate Nazis! And then suddenly there is such a far-fetched accusation. We are doing exactly the same thing today, but no one in America or in Mexico would even get the idea to come up with something like that. This only happens in Germany. Our reply to this animosity was 'Links 2-3-4', and with that we had made it clear where we stand politically."<ref name="RS DE interview">{{Cite magazine |date=4 January 2019 |title=Rammstein: Exklusives Interview mit Till Lindemann und Flake |url=https://www.rollingstone.de/rammstein-exklusives-interview-mit-till-lindemann-und-flake-lorenz-343190/ |access-date=1 March 2023 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone Germany]] |language=German}}</ref> Regarding the song, Kruspe said: {{"'}}My heart beats on the left, two, three, four'. It's simple. If you want to put us in a political category, we're on the left side, and that's the reason we made the song".<ref>{{cite news |author= Serba, John |title= Operatic Vocals, Industrial Rhythms Mix For a Sound Distinctly ... German |newspaper= Grand Rapids Press |date= 22 July 2001 |page= B6}}</ref> The song's title refers to the refrain of the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] song ''[[Einheitsfrontlied]]'', written by [[Bertholt Brecht]]: "Drum links, zwei, drei! Drum links, zwei, drei! / Wo dein Platz, Genosse ist! / Reih dich ein, in die Arbeitereinheitsfront / Weil du auch ein Arbeiter bist".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/music/lyrics/de/die-einheitsfront.htm |title=Die Einheitsfront |publisher=Marxists Internet Archive |access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref> (Turn left, two, three! Turn left, two, three! / Here's the place, Comrade, for you! / So fall in with the Workers' [[united front]] / For you are a worker too.) Another key lyric expressing the band's allegiance to the left paraphrases the titles of newspaper columns published side by side for several years in the German newspaper ''[[Bild]]'': "Mein Herz schlägt links" ("My heart beats on the left") by [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] Party co-chair and former [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] chair [[Oskar Lafontaine]], and "Mein Herz schlägt auf dem rechten Fleck" ("My heart beats in the right place") by [[Peter Gauweiler]] of the conservative [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/politik/2008/oskar-lafontaine-zum-65-geburtstag-5824596.bild.html |title=Hier gratuliert der schwarze Peter dem roten Oskar |date=15 September 2008 |publisher=bild.de |access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref> Lorenz stated that the song was created to show the band could write a harsh, evil, military-sounding song without being [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://herzeleid.com/en/press/2005-11_flake_chat_english |title= Herzeleid.com (Press) |access-date= 10 April 2007 |publisher= Herzeleid.com |archive-date= 16 February 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070216063348/http://herzeleid.com/en/press/2005-11_flake_chat_english |url-status= dead}}</ref>

The band also wrote the song "[[Amerika (song)|Amerika]]" as a critique of the worldwide cultural and political imperialism of the [[United States]]. In their book ''Envisioning Social Justice in Contemporary German Culture'', Jill E. Twark and Axel Hildebrandt found that the song's text and most of its video's images point toward a critique of America's cultural imperialism, political propaganda, and self-assumed role as global police force. The song responds critically to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. They also found that another song of theirs that is critical of the United States is "[[Mein Land]]", believing that it critiques American racism and nationalism.<ref name=rammsteinincage/>

During the Eastern European leg of their [[Europe Stadium Tour]], the band showed support for the [[LGBT]] community on several occasions. At a concert in [[Chorzów]], Poland on 24 July 2019, drummer Christoph Schneider surfed the crowd in a rubber boat, holding a [[Rainbow flag (LGBT)|rainbow flag]]. At their concert in Moscow five days later, guitarists Kruspe and Landers kissed onstage, while they embraced each other during a concert in [[Saint Petersburg]] on 2 August.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rammstein Protests Homophobia in Russia With On-Stage Kiss in Moscow |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/07/31/rammstein-protests-homophobia-in-russia-with-on-stage-kiss-in-moscow-a66650 |work=The Moscow Times |date=31 July 2019}}</ref> The band's support for gay rights was met with criticism from some Russian politicians. [[Vitaly Milonov]], a member of the [[State Duma]], called the band "idiots" and said: "If they think it possible to behave in such a way, they should also consider it possible to keep this garbage away from us."<ref>{{cite news |title=Wenn sie sich küssen wollen, sollen sie das in der Ukraine tun |url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/gesellschaft/panorama/russischer-duma-abgeordneter-ueber-rammstein-wenn-sie-sich-kuessen-wollen-sollen-sie-das-in-der-ukraine-tun/24871460.html |access-date=6 August 2019 |work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |date=5 August 2019 |language=de|trans-title=If they want to kiss, they should do it in Ukraine}}</ref>

Since forming in 1994, Rammstein have retained a constant line-up.
