'''Peter Brian Gabriel''' (born 13 February 1950) is an English singer, songwriter, musician, and human rights activist. He came to prominence as the original frontman of the rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]].<ref name="hudak" /> He left the band in 1975 and launched a solo career with "[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]" as his first single. After releasing four successful studio albums, all titled ''Peter Gabriel'', his fifth studio album, ''[[So (album)|So]]'' (1986), became his best-selling release and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the US. The album's most successful single, "[[Sledgehammer (Peter Gabriel song)|Sledgehammer]]", won a record nine [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Awards]] at the [[1987 MTV Video Music Awards]]. A 2011 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' report said "Sledgehammer" was the most played music video of all time on [[MTV]].<ref name="Time">{{cite magazine |last=Levy |first=Glen |date=26 July 2011 |title=The 30 All-TIME Best Music Videos - Peter Gabriel, 'Sledgehammer' (1986) |url=https://entertainment.time.com/2011/07/28/the-30-all-time-best-music-videos/slide/peter-gabriel-sledgehammer-1986/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202203318/http://entertainment.time.com/2011/07/28/the-30-all-time-best-music-videos/slide/peter-gabriel-sledgehammer-1986/ |archive-date=2 December 2014 |access-date=19 October 2024 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Gabriel was born in [[Chobham]] on 13 February 1950, the son of Edith Irene (nÃ©e Allen, 1921â€“2016) and Ralph Parton Gabriel (1912â€“2012). His maternal grandfather was Colonel Edward Allen, chairman of the [[Civil Service Supply Association|Civil Service Department Store]] on [[Strand, London|London's Strand]], and his paternal grandfather was Christopher Burton Gabriel (1876â€“1947). His mother came from a musical family, while his father was an electrical engineer and dairy farm owner from a long-established family of London timber importers and merchants. He was raised at Deep Pool Farm, a [[Country house|Victorian manor]] near Chobham.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=25}}<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=Full Moon Update October 2023 |date=28 October 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rrqRYF5lZI |access-date=2023-10-29 |publisher=Peter Gabriel |language=en}}</ref> His great-great-great-uncle, [[Sir Thomas Gabriel, 1st Baronet]], was [[Lord Mayor of London]] from 1866 to 1877, who in turn was the grandson of Cornish Plane maker Christopher Gabriel.<ref name="Telegraph 2007-11-24">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyhistory/3355127/Family-detective-Peter-Gabriel.html|title=Family detective: Peter Gabriel|date=24 November 2007|first=Nick|last=Barratt|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2 July 2019|archive-date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702160342/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/familyhistory/3355127/Family-detective-Peter-Gabriel.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Gabriel attended the private primary school Cable House in [[Woking]] and St Andrews Preparatory School for Boys in [[Horsell]].{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=25}} During his time at the latter, his teachers noticed his singing talent, but he instead opted for piano lessons from his mother and developed an interest in drumming. At age 10, he purchased a floor tom-tom.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=26}}

Gabriel later remarked of his early influences, "[[Hymn]]s played quite a large part. They were the closest I came to [[soul music]] before I discovered soul music. There are certain hymns that you can scream your lungs out on, and I used to love that. It was great when you used to get the old shivers down the back."<ref name="White Shadow pp12">[[Capital London|Capital Radio]] interview with [[Alan Freeman]], broadcast October 1982; transcribed in Gabriel fanzine ''White Shadow'' (#3, pp12) by editor Fred Tomsett</ref> He wrote his first song, "Sammy the Slug", at age 12. An aunt gave him money for professional singing lessons around this time, but he used it to buy [[the Beatles]]' debut album ''[[Please Please Me]]'', which had just been released.{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=26}} In September 1963, he started at the [[public school (United Kingdom)|public]] [[Charterhouse School]] in [[Godalming]].{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} There, he was a drummer and vocalist for his first band, the [[trad jazz]] outfit the Milords (or M'Lords). This was followed by a holiday band called the Spoken Word,{{sfn|Easlea|2018|p=34}} which recorded an [[Acetate disc|acetate]] in 1966.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=16}} Gabriel played drums in both these bands, with [[Mike Rutherford]] later commenting, "Pete was{{emdash}}and still is, I think{{emdash}}a frustrated drummer."<ref name="Mike on Mike">Neer, Dan (1985). ''Mike on Mike'' [interview LP], Atlantic Recording Corporation.</ref>

== Career ==
=== 1965â€“1975: Early career and Genesis ===
In 1965, while still at Charterhouse, Gabriel formed the band [[Garden Wall (band)|Garden Wall]] with his schoolmates [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] on piano, Johnny Trapman on trumpet, and [[Chris Stewart (author)|Chris Stewart]] on drums.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=16}} Banks had started at Charterhouse at the same time as Gabriel, and the two were uninterested in school activities but bonded over music and started to write songs. At their final concert before they broke up, Gabriel wore a [[kaftan]] and beads and showered the audience with petals he had picked from neighbouring gardens.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} Garden Wall disbanded in 1967; Gabriel and Banks were invited by their Charterhouse schoolmates [[Anthony Phillips]] and [[Mike Rutherford]], who were in their own band at the school called [[Anon (band)|Anon]] until it split up the previous year, to work on a [[Demo (music)|demo]] tape of songs together.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=17}} Gabriel and Banks contributed "She Is Beautiful", the first song they wrote together. The tape was sent to Charterhouse alumnus, musician [[Jonathan King]], who was immediately enthusiastic largely due to Gabriel's vocals. He signed the group and suggested that their name be Gabriel's Angels, but this was unpopular with the other members, and they soon settled on his other suggestion of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]].

After King suggested they stick to more straightforward pop, Gabriel and Banks wrote "[[The Silent Sun]]" as a pastiche of the [[Bee Gees]], one of King's favourite bands. It became Genesis' first single, released in 1968,{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=17}} and was included on their debut studio album ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'' (1968). Following the commercial failure of ''From Genesis to Revelation'', the band went their separate ways, and Gabriel continued his studies at Charterhouse.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=22}} In September 1969, Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, and Phillips decided to drop their plans and make Genesis a full-time band. In early 1970, Gabriel played the flute on ''[[Mona Bone Jakon]]'' by [[Cat Stevens]]. The second studio album by Genesis, ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' (1970), marked Gabriel expanding his musical output with the flute, accordion, tambourine, and bass drum, and incorporating his [[soul music]] influences. Gabriel explained that he was driven to play these instruments because he was uncomfortable with doing nothing during instrumental sections.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=84}} He would have preferred to play keyboard instruments, but said, "[Banks] was extraordinarily possessive about the keyboards. I'd done a bit of flute at school, I always liked the sound, and a little bit of oboe (I was an even worse oboe player, but it made a couple of good noises now and again). Then the bass drum was something physical, visual, that I could kick hard and occasionally it was in time!"{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=54}} The album sold few copies, with Gabriel at one point securing a place to study at the [[London Film School|London School of Film Technique]] because the band "seemed to be dying".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Blake |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Blake (writer) |date=December 2011 |title=Cash for questions: Peter Gabriel |magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |page=46}}</ref>

Genesis soon recruited guitarist [[Steve Hackett]] and drummer [[Phil Collins]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=43}} Gabriel began growing in confidence as a frontman; during an encore performance of "[[The Knife (song)|The Knife]]" on 19 June 1971, he took a running jump into the audience and expected them to catch him, only for them to instead move out of the way and leave him to land on the floor and break his ankle. He consequently had to perform Genesis' next several shows with a wheelchair and crutches.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=83}} Also during the ''Trespass'' tour, he started to recite stories to introduce songs as a way to cover the silence while the band tuned their instruments or technical faults were being fixed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/peter-gabriel-you-could-feel-the-horror-29379|title=Peter Gabriel: "You could feel the horror ..." â€“ Uncut|date=19 October 2012|website=Uncut.co.uk|access-date=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023120219/http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/peter-gabriel-you-could-feel-the-horror-29379|archive-date=23 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> These stories were all improvised on the spot, and evolved as the tour went along.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=84}} The opener of their next studio album, ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' (1971), "[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]", was their first song in which Gabriel incorporated a story and characters into the lyrics, as the lyrics to previous story-based Genesis songs such as "White Mountain" and "One-Eyed Hound" were all written by other members of the group.{{cn|date=October 2024}} Gabriel was the primary writer of "Harold the Barrel", another story song on ''Nursery Cryme'', with Collins helping him on the lyrics.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=104}}

[[File:Peter Gabriel The Moonlight Knight (cropped).png|thumb|upright|right|Gabriel as "Britannia" or "[[Dancing with the Moonlit Knight|The Moonlit Knight]]" in 1974]]

The shows featuring ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' (1972) marked a key development in Gabriel's stage performance. During a gig in [[Dublin]] in September 1972, he disappeared from the set during the instrumental section of "[[The Musical Box (Genesis song)|The Musical Box]]" and reappeared in his wife's red dress and a fox's head, mimicking the album's cover. The idea of the fox costume had been suggested to him by [[Paul Conroy (music executive)|Paul Conroy]] and Glen Colson, employees of Genesis's record label, [[Charisma Records]].{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=155-157}} Gabriel said he consulted the rest of Genesis about the fox costume but grew tired of arguing about it, but the other members all maintained that nothing was said about it beforehand and that when Gabriel came out in costume they initially mistook him for a fan invading the stage.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=157, 162}} The incident received front-page coverage in ''Melody Maker'', giving them national exposure which allowed the group to double their performance fee.{{cn|date=October 2024}} One of Gabriel's stories was printed on the liner notes of their live album, ''[[Genesis Live]]'' (1973). By late 1973, following the success of ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' (1973), which centred on English themes and literary and materialistic references, a typical Genesis show had Gabriel wear fluorescent make-up, a cape, and bat wings for "[[Watcher of the Skies]]", a helmet, chest plate, and a shield for "[[Dancing with the Moonlit Knight]]", a  [[crown of thorns]] and a flower mask for "[[Supper's Ready]]", and an old man mask for "The Musical Box".{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=162, 203}}

Gabriel continued to fight for involvement with Genesis's keyboards throughout his time with the group, and following a lengthy argument with Banks, he was allowed to play a minor keyboard part on "[[I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)]]", only for this part to be left out of the mix.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=197}} "I Know What I Like" became Genesis's first hit single, reaching number 21 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/genesis/ Genesis UK chart history], The Official Charts Company. Retrieved 13 October 2024.</ref>

[[File:Peter Gabriel, April 1975.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gabriel performing during [[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour]], 1975]]

''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'' (1974) was Gabriel's final studio album with Genesis. He devised its story of the spiritual journey of Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City, and insisted upon writing all the lyrics himself, whereas on previous albums the lyrics had been divided among all the members of Genesis.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=211-213}} Tensions increased during this period, and Gabriel split with the band to pursue a film project with [[William Friedkin]], only to rejoin a week later.<ref name="Mike on Mike" /> Matters were complicated further with the difficult birth of Gabriel's first daughter, resulting in periods of time away from the band. The other members complained that Gabriel was showing a lack of commitment to the band. Gabriel saw this as a "really unsympathetic handling of my dealing with a family crisis" and said it caused a breakdown in his relationships with the rest of Genesis; Rutherford later admitted that they had been overly fixated on their music and were very unhelpful in what must have been a difficult time for Gabriel.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=217-218}} Gabriel was late to deliver the lyrics, but has denied that he was too busy to write much music for the album and relied on contributions from Banks and Rutherford.{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=236}} Banks corroborated that Gabriel was the primary composer of the ''Lamb'' songs "[[The Carpet Crawlers]]" and "The Chamber of 32 Doors" and the sole composer of "Counting Out Time".{{sfn|Giammetti|2020|p=225-228}}

During a stop in Cleveland, Ohio, early into the album's tour, Gabriel informed the band of his intention to leave at its conclusion.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=158}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Saavedra |first=David |date=24 September 2024 |title=Greek mythology and oversized egos: The Genesis album that ended progressive rock |work=El Pais |url=https://english.elpais.com/culture/2024-09-24/greek-mythology-and-oversized-egos-the-genesis-album-that-ended-progressive-rock.html |access-date=8 October 2024 }}</ref> Rutherford recalled that they all "could see it coming".<ref name="Mike on Mike" /> Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel's theatrics and took the band's musical performance as secondary, which irritated the rest of the band.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=93}} The tour ended in May 1975, after which Gabriel wrote a piece for the press on 15 August, entitled "Out, Angels Out", about his departure, his disillusion with the business, and his desire to spend time with his family.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=107}} The news stunned fans of the group and left commentators wondering if the band could survive without him.<ref name="Leaves Genesis">{{cite news|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-gabriel-leaves-genesis/|first=Dave|last=Swanson|title=38 Years Ago: Peter Gabriel Leaves Genesis|website=Ultimateclassicrock.com|date=15 August 2013|access-date=13 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821051141/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-gabriel-leaves-genesis/|archive-date=21 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Reunion">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10903747/Genesis-back-together-after-nearly-40-years.html|first=Anita|last=Singh|title=Genesis back together after nearly 40 years|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 June 2014|access-date=13 August 2015|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924202057/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10903747/Genesis-back-together-after-nearly-40-years.html|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> His exit resulted in drummer [[Phil Collins]] reluctantly taking over on lead vocals after 400 singers were fruitlessly auditioned.

=== 1975â€“1985: Solo debut with four self-titled albums ===
Gabriel described his break from the music business as his "learning period", during which he took piano and music lessons. He had recorded demos by the end of 1975, the fruits of a period of writing around 20 songs with his friend Martin Hall.<ref name=MM751206>{{cite web|url=https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/interview-pg-gabriel-tells-all-melody-maker-6th-december/|title=Behind Peter Gabriel's mask|first=Chris|last=Welch|date=6 December 1975|work=Melody Maker|pages=8â€“9|access-date=20 June 2019|archive-date=20 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620170128/https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/interview-pg-gabriel-tells-all-melody-maker-6th-december/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1977, Gabriel released his solo debut, ''[[Peter Gabriel (1977 album)|Peter Gabriel]]'', which was recorded in Toronto with [[Bob Ezrin]] serving as the album's producer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Roberts |first=Chris |date=8 January 2021 |title=How Peter Gabriel ditched the masks and made the album that changed his life |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/how-peter-gabriel-ditched-the-masks-and-made-the-album-that-changed-his-life |access-date=27 February 2025|website=Louder}}</ref> Gabriel did not title his first four studio albums. All were labelled ''Peter Gabriel'', using the same typeface, with designs by [[Hipgnosis]]. "The idea is to do it like a magazine, which will only come out once a year," he remarked in 1978.

''Peter Gabriel'' (a.k.a. ''Peter Gabriel 1: Car'') was released in February 1977 and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 38 in the US. Its [[lead single]], "[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]", is an autobiographical song about a spiritual experience on top of [[Solsbury Hill]] in Somerset.

In late 1977, Gabriel started recording the [[Peter Gabriel (1978 album)|second ''Peter Gabriel'' studio album]] (a.k.a. ''Peter Gabriel 2: Scratch'') in the Netherlands, with Fripp as producer. Its "Mother of Violence" was written by Gabriel and his first wife Jill. Released in June 1978, the album went to No. 10 in the UK and No. 45 in the US. Gabriel's tour for the album lasted from August to December 1978. On this tour, Gabriel and his band shaved their heads.

Gabriel recorded the [[Peter Gabriel (1980 album)|third ''Peter Gabriel'' studio album]] (a.k.a. ''Peter Gabriel 3: Melt'') in England in 1979. He developed an interest in African music and [[drum machine]]s and later hailed the record as his artistic breakthrough. Gabriel banned the use of cymbals on the album in order to grant more sonic space for instruments like keyboards and synths. This resulted in the creation of the distinctive [[gated reverb]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Flans |first=Robyn |date=1 May 2005 |title=Classic Tracks: Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" |url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_phil_collins_air/index.html |url-status=dead |journal=Mix Online |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317065230/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_phil_collins_air/index.html |archive-date=17 March 2007 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> a noise processing technique which came about while recording drums on "[[Intruder (song)|Intruder]]", one of the tracks featuring [[Phil Collins]]. Collins implemented the reverb to great effect on his debut solo single "[[In the Air Tonight]]" and it has since became a signature sound of the 1980s and beyond.

Upon completion [[Atlantic Records]], Gabriel's US distributor who had released his first two albums, refused to put out ''Peter Gabriel 3: Melt'' as they thought it was not commercial enough. Gabriel signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Mercury Records]].<ref name="Rolling Stone 1987-10-29">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/peter-gabriel-hits-the-big-time-106473/|title=Peter Gabriel Hits the Big Time|first=Steve|last=Pond|date=29 January 1987|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=22 June 2019|archive-date=22 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622145805/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/peter-gabriel-hits-the-big-time-106473/|url-status=live}}</ref> Released in May 1980, the album went to No. 1 in the UK for three weeks.

After a handful of shows in 1979, Gabriel toured the album from February to October 1980. The tour marked Gabriel's first successful instance of [[crowd surfing]] (following his failed June 1971 attempt when touring with Genesis) when he fell back into the audience in a crucifix position. The stunt became a staple of his live shows.<ref name="Rolling Stone 1987-10-29" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/thearchive/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sounds-March-8th-1980-HF-reviews-pg-at-Edinburgh-1733x2500.jpg|title=On the road â€“ The games people play|first=Hugh|last=Fielder|page=51|date=8 March 1980|work=Sounds|access-date=22 June 2019|archive-date=13 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613102425/http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/thearchive/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sounds-March-8th-1980-HF-reviews-pg-at-Edinburgh-1733x2500.jpg|url-status=live}}</ref>

On [[Peter Gabriel (1982 album)|''Peter Gabriel'' four]] (a.k.a. ''Peter Gabriel 4: Security''), Gabriel took on greater responsibility over the production than before. He recorded it in 1981 and 1982, solely on digital tape, with a mobile studio parked at his home, [[Ashcombe House, Somerset|Ashcombe House]], in Somerset. Gabriel utilized a [[Fairlight CMI]] digital [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]] synthesizer and incorporated electronic instrumentation with sampling world beat percussion. "Over the course of the last two albums," he observed, "I've got back into a rhythm consciousness. And the writingâ€”particularly with the invention of these drum machinesâ€”is fantastic. You can store in their memories rhythms that interest you and excite you. And then the groove will carry on without you, and the groove will be exactly what you want it to be, rather than what a drummer thinks is appropriate for what you're doing."<ref name="White Shadow pp12" />

The fourth ''Peter Gabriel'', released in September 1982, hit No. 6 in the UK and No. 28 in the US. The second single, "[[Shock the Monkey]]", became Gabriel's first top 40 hit in the US, reaching No. 29. To handle American distribution, Gabriel signed with [[Geffen Records]], whichâ€”initially unbeknown to Gabrielâ€”titled the album ''Security'' to differentiate it from the first three. Gabriel's 1982 tour lasted a year and became his first to make a profit.<ref name="Musician 1986-07" /> Recordings from the tour were released on Gabriel's debut live release, ''[[Plays Live]]'' (1983).

Gabriel produced versions of the third and fourth ''Peter Gabriel'' albums with German lyrics. The third consisted of the studio recordings, overdubbed with new vocals. The fourth was remixed, with several tracks extended or altered.

In 1983, Gabriel developed the soundtrack for [[Alan Parker]]'s drama film ''[[Birdy (film)|Birdy]]'' (1984), co-produced with [[Daniel Lanois]]. This consisted of new material, without lyrics, as well as remixed instrumentals from his previous studio album.

In 1988, Gabriel became involved as composer for [[Martin Scorsese]]'s film ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988). Scorsese had contacted Gabriel about the project since 1983 and wished, according to Gabriel, to present "the struggle between the humanity and divinity of Christ in a powerful and original way".<ref name=UCR15>{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-gabriel-passion/|title=Revisiting Peter Gabriel's 'Passion' soundtrack|first=Ted|last=Asregadoo|date=5 June 2015|access-date=22 June 2019|archive-date=22 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622184453/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-gabriel-passion/|url-status=live}}</ref> Gabriel used musicians from [[World of Music, Arts and Dance|WOMAD]] to perform instrumental pieces with focus on rhythm and African, Middle Eastern and European textures, using the [[British Library Sound Archive|National Sound Archive]] in London for additional inspiration.<ref name=UCR15/> The initial plan had dedicated ten weeks for recording before it was cut to three, leaving Gabriel unable to finish all the pieces he originally wanted to record.<ref name=UCR15/> When the film was finished, Gabriel worked on the soundtrack for an additional four months to develop more of his unfinished ideas. Its soundtrack was released as ''[[Passion (Peter Gabriel album)|Passion]]'' in June 1989. It won Gabriel a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best New Age Album|Best New Age Performance]] and a nomination for a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score â€“ Motion Picture]]. In 1990, Gabriel put out his first compilation album, ''[[Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats]]'', which sold 2 million copies in the US.

Up until 1989, Gabriel was managed by [[Gail Colson]].<ref name="Perrone">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/market-leaders-pick-their-market-leader-whos-the-manager-on-top-of-the-rock-1134011.html|title=Market Leaders Pick Their Market Leader: Who's the manager on top of the rock? â€“ Business â€“ News â€“ The Independent|last=Perrone|first=Pierre|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=5 July 2015|location=London|date=22 December 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708093352/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/market-leaders-pick-their-market-leader-whos-the-manager-on-top-of-the-rock-1134011.html|archive-date=8 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> From 1989 to 1992, Gabriel recorded his follow-up to ''So'', titled ''[[Us (Peter Gabriel album)|Us]]''. The album saw Gabriel address personal themes, including his failed first marriage, psychotherapy, and the growing distance between him and his eldest daughter at the time.

Gabriel's introspection within the context of the album ''Us'' can be seen in the first single release "[[Digging in the Dirt]]" directed by John Downer. Accompanied by a video featuring Gabriel covered in snails and various foliage, this song made reference to the psychotherapy which had taken up much of Gabriel's time since the previous studio album. Gabriel describes his struggle to get through to his daughter in "[[Come Talk to Me]]" directed by [[Matt Mahurin]], which featured backing vocals by [[SinÃ©ad O'Connor]]. O'Connor also lent vocals to "[[Blood of Eden]]", directed by [[Nichola Bruce]] and Michael Coulson, the third single to be released from the album, and once again dealing with relationship struggles, this time going right back to [[Adam]]'s rib for inspiration.

The album is one of Gabriel's most personal. It met with less success than ''So'', reaching No. 2 in the album chart on both sides of the Atlantic, and making modest chart impact with the singles "Digging in the Dirt" and the funkier "[[Steam (Peter Gabriel song)|Steam]]", which evoked memories of "Sledgehammer". Gabriel followed the release of the album with the [[Secret World Tour]], first using touring keyboardist Joy Askew to sing O'Connor's part, then O'Connor herself for a few months.<ref name=Zindler1999>{{cite web |url=https://www.genesis-news.com/c-Peter-Gabriel-Secret-World-Tour-19931994-Tour-report-s233.html |title=Peter Gabriel Secret World Tour |first=Bernd |last=Zindler |website=Genesis News |date=Autumn 1999 |access-date=20 March 2022}}</ref> O'Connor quit the tour, and was replaced by [[Paula Cole]], the latter appearing on the tour recordings: a double album ''[[Secret World Live]]'', and a concert video also called ''[[Secret World Live (film)|Secret World Live]]'', both released in 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.popmatters.com/162756-peter-gabriel-secret-world-live-2495819594.html |title=Revisiting His Weird and Wonderful Performance: 'Peter Gabriel: Secret World Live' |date=11 September 2012 |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |access-date=22 March 2022}}</ref> The film received the 1996 [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]], naming director Francois Girard and producer Robert Warr.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grammy.com/awards/38th-annual-grammy-awards|title=38th Annual Grammy Awards|publisher=Grammy|access-date=30 July 2024}}</ref>

Gabriel employed an innovative approach in the marketing of the ''Us'' album. Not wishing to feature only images of himself, he asked artist filmmakers [[Nichola Bruce]] and Michael Coulson to co-ordinate a marketing campaign using contemporary artists. Artists such as [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Rebecca Horn]], [[Nils-Udo]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[David Mach]] and [[Yayoi Kusama]] collaborated to create original artworks for each song on the multi-million-selling CD. Coulson and Bruce documented the process on Hi-8 video. Bruce left Real World and Coulson continued with the campaign, using the documentary background material as the basis for a promotional EPK, the long-form video ''All About Us'' and the interactive CD-ROM ''[[Xplora1: Peter Gabriel's Secret World]]''.

Gabriel won three more [[Grammy Awards]], all in the Music Video category. He won the [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video]] in 1993 and 1994 for the videos to "Digging in the Dirt" and "Steam", respectively. Gabriel also won the 1996 [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]] for his ''[[Secret World Live (DVD)|Secret World Live]]'' video.

===1997â€“2009: ''OVO'' and ''Up'' ===
In 1997, Gabriel was invited to participate in the direction and soundtrack of the [[Millennium Dome Show]], a live multimedia performance staged in the [[Millennium Dome]] in London throughout 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ovo-mw0000461812|title=Peter Gabriel â€“ OVO|website=AllMusic|access-date=22 June 2019|archive-date=18 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518165524/https://www.allmusic.com/album/ovo-mw0000461812|url-status=live}}</ref> Gabriel said the team were given free rein, which contributed to the various problems they encountered with it, such as a lack of proper budgeting.

Around that same time, the Genesis greatest hits album, ''[[Turn It On Again: The Hits]]'' (1999), featured Gabriel sharing vocals with [[Phil Collins]] on a new version of "[[The Carpet Crawlers]]" entitled "The Carpet Crawlers 1999", produced by [[Trevor Horn]].

In 2002 he stuck with soundtrack work for his next project, scoring for the Australian film ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'' (2002) with [[worldbeat]] music. Released in June 2002, ''[[Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence]]'' received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Score â€“ Motion Picture.

Later in 2002, ''[[Up (Peter Gabriel album)|Up]]'', Gabriel's first full-length studio album in a decade, was released in September 2002. He started work on it in 1995 before production halted three years later to focus time on other projects and collaborations. Work resumed in 2000, by which time Gabriel had 130 potential songs for the album, and spent almost two years on it before management at [[Virgin Records]] pushed Gabriel to complete it.<ref name=TG02>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/sep/19/artsfeatures.popandrock1|title=Don't hurry, be happy|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|date=19 September 2002|work=The Guardian|access-date=22 June 2019|archive-date=22 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622224027/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/sep/19/artsfeatures.popandrock1|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Up'' reached No. 9 in the US and No. 11 in the UK, and supported with a world tour with a band that included Gabriel's daughter Melanie on backing vocals. The tour was documented with two live DVDs: ''[[Growing Up Live]]'' (2003) and ''[[Still Growing Up: Live & Unwrapped]]'' (2005).

In 2004, Gabriel met with his former Genesis bandmates to discuss the possibility of staging ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'' (1974) as a reunion tour. He ultimately dismissed the idea, paving the way for Banks, Rutherford and Collins to organise the [[Turn It On Again: The Tour]]. Gabriel produced and performed at the [[Live 8 concert, Eden Project|Eden Project Live 8 concert]] in July 2005. He joined [[Cat Stevens]] on stage to perform "[[Wild World (song)|Wild World]]" during [[Nelson Mandela]]'s [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] concert. In 2005, [[FIFA]] asked Gabriel and Brian Eno to organise an opening ceremony for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, but FIFA cancelled the idea in January 2006. At the opening ceremony of the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Gabriel performed [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]".<ref>{{cite web |last=Poggioli |first=Sylvia |date=10 February 2006 |title=Olympic Games Kick Off with Art, Fashion, Dance |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5201016&t=1559291469474 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719041439/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5201016&t=1559291469474 |archive-date=19 July 2020 |access-date=31 May 2019 |publisher=[[NPR]]}}</ref>

In November 2006, the Seventh World Summit of [[Nobel Peace Laureate]]s in Rome presented Gabriel with the [[Man of Peace]] award. The award, presented by former General Secretary of the USSR and Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Walter Veltroni]], Mayor of Rome, was an acknowledgement of Gabriel's extensive contribution and work on behalf of human rights and peace. The award was presented in the Giulio Cesare Hall of the Campidoglio in Rome. At the end of the year, he was awarded the ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to him by American musician [[Moby]]. In an interview published in the magazine to accompany the award, Gabriel's contribution to music was described as "vast and enduring".

Gabriel took on a project with the [[BBC World Service]]'s competition "The Next Big Thing" to find the world's best young band. Gabriel judged the final six young artists with [[William Orbit]], [[Geoff Travis]] and [[AngÃ©lique Kidjo]].

In June 2008, Gabriel released ''[[Big Blue Ball]]'', an album of various artists collaborating with each other at his Real World Studios across three summers in the 1990s. He planned its release in the US without assistance from a label; he raised Â£2&nbsp;million towards the recording and distribution of the album with [[Ingenious Media]] with the worldwide release handled through [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref>Durman, Paul.

Gabriel contributed to the [[Pixar]] film ''[[WALL-E]]'' soundtrack in 2008 with [[Thomas Newman]], including the film's closing song, "[[Down to Earth (Peter Gabriel song)|Down to Earth]]", for which they received the [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]]. The song was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. In February 2009, Gabriel announced that he would not be performing on the [[81st Academy Awards|2008 Academy Awards]] telecast because producers of the show were limiting his performance of "Down to Earth" from ''WALL-E'' to 90 seconds. According to Gabriel, his window was reduced to 65 seconds. [[John Legend]] and the [[Soweto Gospel Choir]] performed the song in his stead.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Finke |first=Nikki |date=2009-02-12 |title=Peter Gabriel Pissed At Oscar Producers And Won't Perform At Academy Awards |url=https://deadline.com/2009/02/peter-gabriel-pissed-at-oscar-producers-and-pulls-out-of-performing-at-academy-awards-8434/ |access-date=2023-08-19 |website=Deadline |language=en-US}}</ref>

On 25 July 2009, he played at WOMAD Charlton Park, his only European performance of the year, to promote Witness.

===2009â€“2019: ''Scratch My Back'', ''New Blood'' and further side projects===
[[File:Peter-Gabriel-2011I2.jpg|thumb|right|Gabriel performing at the 2011 Skoll Awards]]
In 2009, Gabriel recorded ''[[Scratch My Back]]'', an album of cover songs by various artists including [[David Bowie]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Radiohead]], [[Regina Spektor]] and [[Neil Young]]. The original concept was for Gabriel to cover an artists' song if they, in turn, covered one of his for an album simultaneously released as ''I'll Scratch Yours'', but several participants later declined or were late to deliver and it was placed on hold.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/10301880/Peter-Gabriel-interview.html|title=Peter Gabriel, interview|website=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=29 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305142157/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/10301880/Peter-Gabriel-interview.html|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live|date=12 September 2013|last=McNulty|first=Bernadette}}</ref> Gabriel avoided using drums and guitar in favour of orchestral arrangements, and altered his usual songwriting method by finishing the vocals first and then the song, for which he collaborated with [[John Metcalfe (composer)|John Metcalfe]].<ref name="NYT10">{{cite web |last=Pareles |first=Jon |author-link=Jon Pareles |date=1 March 2010 |title=Peter Gabriel Says, 'I'll Sing Yours, You Sing Mine' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/arts/music/02gabriel.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190623145854/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/arts/music/02gabriel.html |archive-date=23 June 2019 |access-date=23 June 2019 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Released in February 2010, ''Scratch My Back'' reached No. 12 in the UK.

The follow-up, ''[[And I'll Scratch Yours]]'', was released in September 2013.

During the New Blood Tour, Gabriel decided to expand on the ''Scratch My Back'' concept and, with Metcalfe's assistance, re-record a collection of his own songs with an orchestra. The result, ''[[New Blood (Peter Gabriel album)|New Blood]]'', was released in October 2011.<ref name=Q11>{{cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/07003-peter-gabriel-interview|title=An Invasion of Privacy: Peter Gabriel Interviewed|first=John|last=Doran|work=The Quietus|date=19 September 2011|access-date=23 June 2019|archive-date=9 July 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170709052222/http://thequietus.com/articles/07003-peter-gabriel-interview|url-status=live}}</ref>

Gabriel re-emerged in 2019 with the release of ''[[Rated PG (Peter Gabriel album)|Rated PG]]'', a compilation of songs that were created for film soundtracks throughout his career.

Gabriel has worked with a relatively stable crew of musicians and recording engineers throughout his solo career. Bass and [[Chapman Stick|Stick]] player [[Tony Levin]] has performed on every Gabriel studio album and every live tour except for ''Scratch My Back'' (2010), the soundtracks ''Passion'' (1989) and ''Long Walk Home'' (2002), and the New Blood Tour. Guitarist [[David Rhodes (guitarist)|David Rhodes]] has been Gabriel's guitarist of choice since 1979. Prior to ''So'' (1986), [[Jerry Marotta]] was Gabriel's preferred drummer, both in the studio and on the road. (For the ''So'' and ''Us'' albums and tours Marotta was replaced by [[Manu KatchÃ©]], who was then replaced by [[Ged Lynch]] on parts of the ''Up'' album and all of the subsequent tour). Gabriel is known for choosing top-flight collaborators, from co-producers such as Ezrin, Fripp, Lillywhite and Lanois to musicians such as [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Elizabeth Fraser]], [[L. Shankar]], [[Trent Reznor]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Larry Fast]], [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[SinÃ©ad O'Connor]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Ane Brun]], [[Paula Cole]], [[John Giblin]], [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]], [[Peter Hammill]], [[Papa Wemba]], [[Manu KatchÃ©]], [[Jabu Khanyile|Bayete]], [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Stewart Copeland]] and [[OneRepublic]].

Over the years, Gabriel has collaborated with singer [[Kate Bush]] several times; Bush provided backing vocals for Gabriel's "Games Without Frontiers" and "No Self Control" in 1980, and female lead vocal for "Don't Give Up" (a top 10 hit in the UK) in 1986, and Gabriel appeared on her television special. Their duet of [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]'s "[[Another Day (Roy Harper song)|Another Day]]" was discussed for release as a single, but never appeared.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.katebushencyclopedia.com/another-day|title=Another Day|website=katebushencyclopedia|date=14 August 2017 |access-date=27 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128034923/https://www.katebushencyclopedia.com/another-day|archive-date=28 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

He also collaborated with [[avant-garde]] artist [[Laurie Anderson]] on two versions of her composition "[[Excellent Birds]]"â€”one for her second album ''[[Mister Heartbreak]]'' (1984),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mister-heartbreak-mw0000189067|title=Mister Heartbreak â€“ Laurie Anderson {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=12 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312145114/https://www.allmusic.com/album/mister-heartbreak-mw0000189067|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and another version called "[[Excellent Birds#Background|This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)]]", which appeared on original [[audio cassette|cassette]] and CD versions, and all versions past 2002, of ''So''.

Gabriel sang (along with [[Jim Kerr]] of [[Simple Minds]]) on "Everywhere I Go", from [[The Call (band)|the Call]]'s 1986 studio album, ''Reconciled''. On [[Toni Childs]]' 1994 studio album, ''[[The Woman's Boat]]'', Gabriel sang on the track, "I Met a Man".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-womans-boat-mw0000113374/credits|title=The Woman's Boat â€“ Toni Childs {{!}} Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=12 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312144439/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-womans-boat-mw0000113374/credits|archive-date=12 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1998, Gabriel appeared on the soundtrack of ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' as the lead vocalist of the song "That'll Do", written by [[Randy Newman]]. The song was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], and Gabriel and Newman performed it at the following year's Oscar telecast. He performed a similar soundtrack appearance for the 2004 film ''[[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|Shall We Dance?]]'', singing a [[cover version]] of "[[The Book of Love (The Magnetic Fields song)|The Book of Love]]" by [[the Magnetic Fields]].

In 1987, Gabriel appeared on [[Robbie Robertson]]'s [[Robbie Robertson (album)|self-titled solo studio album]], singing on "Fallen Angel"; co-wrote two [[Tom Robinson]] singles; and appeared on [[Joni Mitchell]]'s 1988 studio album ''[[Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm]]'', on the opening track "My Secret Place".

In 2001, Gabriel contributed lead vocals to the song "When You're Falling" on [[Afro Celt Sound System]]'s ''[[Volume 3: Further in Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realworldrecords.com/catalogue/volume-3-further-in-time/|title=''Volume 3: Further in Time''|website=Realworldrecords.com|access-date=27 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714084340/https://realworldrecords.com/catalogue/volume-3-further-in-time/|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the summer of 2003, Gabriel performed in Ohio with a guest performance by Uzbek singer [[Sevara Nazarkhan]].

Gabriel collaborated on tracks with electronic musician [[BT (musician)|BT]], who also worked on the ''OVO'' soundtrack with him. The tracks were never released, as the computers they were contained on were stolen from BT's home in California. He also sang the lyrics for [[Deep Forest]] on their theme song for the movie ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' (1995). In addition, Gabriel has appeared on [[Angelique Kidjo]]'s 2007 studio album ''[[Djin Djin]]'', singing on the song "Salala".

Gabriel has recorded a cover of the [[Vampire Weekend]] single "[[Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa]]" with [[Hot Chip]], where his name is mentioned several times in the chorus. He substitutes the original line "But this feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / This feels so unnatural/ Peter Gabriel too" with "It feels so unnatural / Peter Gabriel too / and it feels so unnatural / to sing your own name."<ref>{{Cite AV media|title=Hot chip peter gabriel cape cod kwassa kwassa vampire weekend cover|date=2 February 2010|url=https://soundcloud.com/revrev/hot-chip-peter-gabriel-cape-cod-kwassa-kwassa-vampire-weekend-cover|publisher=revrev|language=en|access-date=26 February 2021}}</ref>

Gabriel collaborated with [[Arcade Fire]] on their 2022 studio album, ''[[We (Arcade Fire album)|We]]''.

== WOMAD and other projects ==
Gabriel's interest in [[world music]] was first apparent on his third solo studio album. According to Spencer Kornhaber in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in 2019: "When Peter Gabriel moved toward 'world music' four decades ago, he not only evangelized sounds that were novel to Western pop. He also set a radio template: majestic, with flourishes meant to read as 'exotic,' and lyrics meant to change lives."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/11/coldplay-everyday-life-album-review-vague-saviors/602605/|title=Coldplay Would Like to Save the World With Vagueness|website=[[The Atlantic]]|first=Spencer|last=Kornhaber|date=26 November 2019|access-date=29 November 2019|archive-date=28 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128181950/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/11/coldplay-everyday-life-album-review-vague-saviors/602605/|url-status=live}}</ref> This influence has increased over time, and he co-founded the [[World of Music, Arts and Dance]] (WOMAD) festival in 1982.<ref name="Lynskey 2007">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/26/peter-gabriel-30-years-womad |title=Peter Gabriel on 30 years of WOMAD â€“ and mixing music with politics |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 July 2012 |access-date=25 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419075048/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/26/peter-gabriel-30-years-womad |archive-date=19 April 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Gabriel said:

{{blockquote|The first time I really got into music from another culture was as a result of the shifting of [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], which I used to wake up to. I'd lost it on [[medium wave]] and was groping around in the morning on the dial, trying to find something that I could listen to, and came across a Dutch radio station who were playing the soundtrack from some obscure [[Stanley Baker]] movie called ''[[Dingaka]]''. That had quite a lot of stuff fromâ€”I think it wasâ€”Ghana. I can't remember now, but it really moved me. One of the songs I heard on that was a thing called '[[Shosholoza]]', which I recorded on the b-side of the '[[Biko (song)|Biko]]' single.<ref>[[Capital London|Capital Radio]] interview with [[Alan Freeman]], broadcast October 1982; transcribed in Gabriel fanzine ''White Shadow'' (#3, p. 13) by editor Fred Tomsett</ref>}}

Gabriel created the [[Real World Studios]] and record label to facilitate the creation and distribution of such music by various artists, and he has worked to educate Western culture about such musicians as [[Yungchen Lhamo]], [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] and [[Youssou N'dour]].

In the 1990s, with Steve Nelson of Brilliant Media and director Michael Coulson, he developed advanced multimedia CD-ROM-based entertainment projects, creating ''Xplora'' (the world's largest-selling music CD-ROM), and subsequently the ''[[Peter Gabriel: Eve|EVE]]'' CD-ROM. ''EVE'' was a music and art adventure game directed by Michael Coulson and co-produced by the [[Starwave]] Corporation in Seattle; it won the Milia d'Or award Grand Prize at the Cannes in 1996.

In 1990, Gabriel lent his backing vocals to Ugandan political exile [[Geoffrey Oryema]]'s "Land of Anaka", appearing on Oryema's first studio album ''Exile'', released on Gabriel's Real World label.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://realworldrecords.com/artists/geoffrey-oryema/|title=Geoffrey Oryema â€“ Real World Records|website=Realworldrecord.com|access-date=9 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731031501/https://realworldrecords.com/artists/geoffrey-oryema/|archive-date=31 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1994, Gabriel starred in [[Breck Eisner]]'s short film ''Recon'' as a detective who enters the minds of murder victims to find their killer's identity.

Gabriel helped pioneer a new realm of musical interaction in 2001, visiting [[Georgia State University]]'s Language Research Center to participate in keyboard jam sessions with [[bonobo]] apes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. (This experience inspired the song "Animal Nation", which was performed on Gabriel's 2002 "Growing Up" tour and was featured on the ''[[Growing Up Live]]'' DVD and ''[[The Wild Thornberrys Movie]]'' soundtrack.) Gabriel's desire to bring attention to the intelligence of primates also took the form of ApeNet, a project that aimed to link great apes through the internet, enabling the first interspecies internet communication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=172|title=Peter Gabriel goes ape for research project|work=Top40-Charts.com|access-date=27 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115158/http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=172|archive-date=24 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Gabriel was one of the founders of on Demand Distribution ([[OD2]]), one of the first online music download services. Prior to its closure in 2009, its technology had been used by over 100 music download sites including MSN Music UK, MyCokeMusic, Planet Internet (KPN), Wanadoo and CD WOW!. OD2 was bought by US company Loudeye in June 2004 and subsequently by Finnish mobile giant [[Nokia]] in October 2006 for $60&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2006 {{!}} Nokia Museum |url=https://nokiamuseum.info/category/launching-year/2006/ |access-date=26 February 2021 |website=nokiamuseum.info |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1986, Gabriel started what has become a longstanding association with [[Amnesty International]], becoming a pioneering participant in all 28 of Amnesty's ''[[Human rights concerts]]''â€”a series of music events and tours staged by the US Section of Amnesty International between 1986 and 1998. He performed during the six-concert ''[[A Conspiracy of Hope]]'' US tour in June 1986; the twenty-concert ''[[Human Rights Now!]]'' world tour in 1988; the ''Chile: Embrace of Hope Concert'' in 1990 and at ''The Paris Concert for Amnesty International'' in 1998. He also performed in Amnesty's ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls|Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' benefit shows in collaboration with other artists and friends such as Lou Reed, [[David Gilmour]] of [[Pink Floyd]] and Youssou N'Dour; Gabriel closed those concerts performing his anti-[[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] anthem "Biko".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0UYgKOv9_g |title=Peter Gabriel talks about his work for Amnesty International |date=28 May 2009 |via=YouTube |access-date=16 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227004934/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0UYgKOv9_g |archive-date=27 February 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the late 1990s, Gabriel and entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]] discussed with [[Nelson Mandela]] their idea of a small, dedicated group of leaders, working objectively and without any vested personal interest to solve difficult global conflicts. On 18 July 2007, in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, Nelson Mandela announced the formation of a new group, [[The Elders (organization)|The Elders]], in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday. [[Kofi Annan]] served as Chair of the Elders and [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] as deputy chair. The other members of the group are [[Martti Ahtisaari]], [[Ela Bhatt]], [[Lakhdar Brahimi]], [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], [[Jimmy Carter]],<ref name="New Statesman">{{cite web |last=Mossman |first=Kate |date=3 October 2013 |title=Peter Gabriel: Pop stardom and reimagining politics |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/09/dream-factory |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418074444/http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/09/dream-factory |archive-date=18 April 2016 |access-date=29 September 2016 |website=Newstatesman.com}}</ref> [[Hina Jilani]], [[GraÃ§a Machel]], [[Mary Robinson]]<ref name="New Statesman" /> and [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. [[Desmond Tutu]] was an Honorary Elder, as was Nelson Mandela. The Elders is independently funded by a group of donors, including Branson and Gabriel, and use their collective skills to catalyse peaceful resolutions to long-standing conflicts, articulate new approaches to global issues that are causing or may later cause immense human suffering, and share wisdom by helping to connect voices all over the world. They work together to consider carefully which specific issues to approach.

In September 2008, Gabriel was named as the recipient of Amnesty International's 2008 ''Ambassador of Conscience Award''.

In December 2013, Gabriel posted a video message in tribute to the deceased former South African president and anti-apartheid leader [[Nelson Mandela]]. Gabriel was quoted:

{{blockquote|To come out of 27 years in jail and to immediately set about building a Rainbow Nation with your sworn enemy is a unique and extraordinary example of courage and forgiveness. In this case, Mandela had seen many of his people beaten, imprisoned and murdered, yet he was still willing to trust the humanity and idealism of those who had been the oppressors, without whom he knew he could not achieve an almost [[peaceful transition of power]].
