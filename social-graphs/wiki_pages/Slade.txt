'''Slade''' are <!-- Per WP:ENGVAR, bands that originate from Great Britain are treated plural. Please do not change "are" to "is". --> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Wolverhampton]] in 1964. They rose to prominence during the [[glam rock]] era in the early 1970s,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/slade-mn0000749734/biography|title=Slade - Biography - AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|date=2 August 2013|access-date=28 October 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802213153/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/slade-mn0000749734/biography|archive-date=2 August 2013}}</ref> achieving 17 consecutive top 20 hits and six number ones on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' names them the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles. They were the first act to have three [[single (music)|singles]] enter the charts at number one; all six of the band's [[record chart|chart-toppers]] were [[songwriter|written]] by [[Noddy Holder]] and [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]]. As of 2006, total UK sales stood at over 6,500,000. Their best-selling single, "[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]", has sold in excess of one million copies.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=506}} According to the 1999 BBC documentary ''It's Slade'', the band have sold more than 50 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pf7kr |title=BBC Four - It's Slade |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=12 April 2014 |access-date=1 February 2018}}</ref>

All four members of Slade grew up in the area of England known as the [[Black Country]]. After a period in different groups, the four members came together by 1966 as 'N Betweens, and recorded some unsuccessful singles. In 1969 Jack Baverstock of [[Philips Records]] signed them and recorded their debut album, changing their name to "Ambrose Slade", a name inspired by Baverstock's secretary, who had named her handbag Ambrose and her shoes Slade.<ref name="Charlesworth"/><ref name="Holder"/> Slade dominated the UK singles charts during the early 1970s.<ref name="500 Number One Hits 2">{{cite book| first= Jo| last= Rice| year= 1982| title= The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits| edition= 1st| publisher= Guinness Superlatives Ltd|location= Enfield, Middlesex| page= 149| isbn= 978-0-85112-250-2}}</ref> Slade achieved twelve Top 5 hit singles in the UK between 1971 and 1974, three of which went straight to No. 1.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=506}} Of the 17 Top 20 hits between 1971 and 1976, six made No. 1, three reached No. 2 and two peaked at No. 3.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=506}} No other UK act of the period enjoyed such consistently high chart placings in the UK [[Top 40]] or sold as many singles.

Following an unsuccessful move to the U.S. in 1975, Slade's popularity in the UK waned, but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last-minute replacements for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Rock Festival]]. The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career. For the next two years, the band produced material tailored towards the heavy-metal scene and by 1984, they finally cracked the American market with the hits "[[Run Runaway]]" and "[[My Oh My (Slade song)|My Oh My]]". This new-found success did not last long, however, and despite a top-25 UK hit in the early 1990s the band split shortly after in 1992. The original line-up split re-formed later in the year as Slade II. The band have continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have also shortened the group name back to Slade. 

A number of artists from diverse genres have cited Slade as an influence. ''The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Music'' tells of Holder's powerful vocals, guitarist [[Dave Hill (guitarist)|Dave Hill]]'s equally arresting dress sense and the [[Sensational spelling|deliberate misspelling]] of their song titles (such as "[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]" and "[[Mama Weer All Crazee Now]]") for which they became well known.{{sfn|Du Noyer|2003|pp=84–85}}

==Career==
===Early years (1966–1970)===
All the members of Slade grew up in the [[Black Country]]. Drummer [[Don Powell]] and bassist [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]] were born and brought up in [[Wolverhampton]], lead vocalist [[Noddy Holder]] was born and brought up in nearby [[Caldmore]] in [[Walsall]], and lead guitarist [[Dave Hill (guitarist)|Dave Hill]] moved to Wolverhampton from [[Holbeton]], [[Devon]] as a child. 

In 1964, drummer [[Don Powell]] and guitarist [[Dave Hill (guitarist)|Dave Hill]] were part of a Midland-based group called the Vendors with John Howells (vocals) Mick Marson (guitar) and Bill Diffey (bass) (Diffey would be replaced by Dave "Cass" Jones the same year).<ref>{{Cite web |last=P |first=Mickey |title=The Vendors |url=https://sladestory.blogspot.com/1971/01/the-vendors.html |access-date=2025-08-23 |website=From Roots To Boots}}</ref> Regulars on the club circuit, they had also recorded a privately pressed four-track EP.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book| first= Martin C.| last= Strong| year= 2000| title= The Great Rock Discography| edition= 5th| publisher= Mojo Books| location= Edinburgh| pages= 889–891| isbn= 978-1-84195-017-4}}</ref> At the time, [[Noddy Holder]] was playing guitar and contributing to vocals in Steve Brett & the Mavericks. Signed to [[Columbia Records]], the band released three singles in 1965.<ref name="autogenerated12">The Genesis of Slade compilation booklet</ref> After listening to American blues artists such as [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]], [[John Lee Hooker]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]], the Vendors decided on a change of direction and name:<ref name="autogenerated12"/> As the 'N Betweens they gained greater recognition and began to get supporting gigs with acts such as [[the Hollies]], [[the Yardbirds]], [[Georgie Fame]] and [[Spencer Davis]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{cite book |first=David |last=Roberts |year=1998 |title=Guinness Rockopedia |edition=1st |publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd. |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/395 395] |isbn=978-0-85112-072-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/395 }}</ref>

The Mavericks and the 'N Betweens were on their way to separate gigs in Germany when they met on a ferry in 1965. Powell and Hill asked Holder if he would be interested in joining The 'N Betweens, but Holder declined. Later, back in their home town of [[Wolverhampton]], the musicians met again and this time Holder agreed to join the group. [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]], whose musical background and strong bass guitar skills were considered an asset, had already been recruited.<ref name="Charlesworth"/> Lea, who also played the piano and violin, had been in the Staffordshire Youth Orchestra and had gained first class honours in a London music-school practical exam.<ref name="Charlesworth">{{cite book |title=Slade, Feel the Noize!: an illustrated biography |last=Charlesworth |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Charlesworth |year=1984 |publisher=[[Music Sales Group|Omnibus Press]] |location=London |isbn=0-7119-0538-X }}</ref> Lea and Holder took over as band members from John Howells (vocals), Mick Marson (guitar) and Cass Jones (bass), who had just left the N' Betweens. Lea had replaced Cass Jones and Holder took on both Howells' and Marson's roles and singer and guitarist.

By 1966, this new version of the 'N Betweens had recorded a promo single of the [[Otis Redding]] track "Security" and a self-penned song, "Evil Witchman", released on [[Highland Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/artist/the-n-betweens/uk |title=The N' Betweens Discography – UK |website=45cat.com |date=2 December 1966 |access-date=4 November 2011}}</ref> A further single, "You Better Run" was released on Columbia Records and produced by [[Kim Fowley]].<ref name=autogenerated12 /><ref name="500 Number One Hits">{{cite book | first= Jo | last= Rice | year= 1982 | title= The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits | edition= 1st | publisher= Guinness Superlatives Ltd | location= Enfield, Middlesex | page= 141 | isbn= 978-0-85112-250-2}}</ref> This last single was reported by Powell to have topped the regional Midland chart, although it failed to make any national impact.<ref>It's Slade 1999 Documentary</ref> Between 1966 and 1967, the band's performance centred on the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Tamla Motown]] styles, while Holder's flair for showmanship began to give the band a focus. During 1967, the band recorded the [[Honeybus]] track "Delighted to See You" which remained unreleased until 1994, where it featured on the various artists compilation ''Psychedelia at Abbey Road''. Although the group did not record again for roughly two years, they built up a respectable reputation on the live circuit.<ref name="Charlesworth"/>[[File:SladeSkinheads1969.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Slade in their skinhead phase in 1969<br />from left: Powell, Lea, Holder, Hill.]]

A local promoter, Roger Allen spotted the group in 1969 and alerted the head of [[A&R]] at [[Philips Records]], Jack Baverstock. The group spent a week in the [[Philips Studios|Philips Studio]] at Stanhope Place recording an album, after which Baverstock offered to sign the group to [[Fontana Records]] if they changed their name and obtained London-based management. The band were initially hesitant because of the reputation gained as the 'N Betweens, but eventually agreed to "Ambrose Slade", a name inspired by Baverstock's secretary, who had named her handbag Ambrose and her shoes Slade.<ref name="Charlesworth"/><ref name="Holder">{{cite book|title=Who's Crazee Now? |last=Holder |first=Noddy |author-link=Noddy Holder|author2=Verrico, Lisa  |year=2000 |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-187503-X }}</ref> Baverstock also found the group an agent, John Gunnel, who had previously worked with the entertainment entrepreneur [[Robert Stigwood]].

The band's debut album ''[[Beginnings (Ambrose Slade album)|Beginnings]]'', released in mid-1969, was a commercial failure, as was the instrumental single "Genesis" and the follow-up single "[[Wild Winds Are Blowing]]".<ref name="Charlesworth"/><ref>Beginnings remastered album booklet</ref> While the album was being recorded, the band were visited by Gunnel and his business partner, [[The Animals|Animals']] bassist [[Chas Chandler]]. Chandler was impressed with what he heard in the studio, and after seeing the band live the following day, offered to manage them. As Chandler had previous managerial experience with [[Jimi Hendrix]], the band accepted.<ref name="Holder"/> Chandler was not pleased with the debut album and thought the band would benefit from writing their own material and a change of image. The band adopted a [[skinhead]] look as an attempt to gain publicity from what was a newsworthy youth fashion trend, but this also added an unwelcome association with [[football hooliganism]].<ref name="Charlesworth"/> Noddy Holder and Don Powell were particularly tough-looking individuals already, and the skinhead look exacerbated the disturbing effect of having "toughs" in the band. In 1970, the band shortened their name to Slade and released a new single, a cover of "[[Shape of Things to Come (song)|Shape of Things to Come]]" which, despite a performance on United Kingdom music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', failed to chart.<ref name="autogenerated17">{{discogs artist}}</ref>

Chandler moved Slade to [[Polydor Records]], believing a higher-profile label would boost sales.<ref name="Charlesworth"/> Lyrics were added to the instrumental "Genesis" from the band's debut album, the result being released as "[[Know Who You Are]]", but again, the single failed to make any impression on the UK chart as did the album ''[[Play It Loud]]'', released in late 1970 and produced by Chandler himself. Later the album was retrospectively well received by fans and critics, and earned a silver disc for sales.<ref>{{cite web |last=Viglione |first=Joe |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r18182 |title=Play It Loud – Slade |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref><ref>Play It Loud remastered booklet</ref>

===Glam rock, success and peak (1971–1974)===

Chandler had been managing the band for almost two years without success when he suggested releasing a version of the [[Bobby Marchan]] song "[[Get Down and Get With It]]", originally performed by [[Little Richard]]. Slade still enjoyed a good reputation as a live act and the song had been used in their performances for many years. Always popular, the song's lyrics demanded audience participation and it was hoped that the feeling of a live gig would be projected into the studio recording.<ref name="Charlesworth"/><ref name="Holder"/> The song was released in mid-1971, and by August it entered the top 20 in the UK chart, peaking at number 16.<ref name=UKCharts/>

The band members grew their hair long and allied themselves to the [[glam rock]] movement of the early 1970s. Hill's stage costumes also became notable during this period.<ref name="allmusic5449">{{cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p5449/biography |title=Slade |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> Chandler now demanded the band write a follow-up single themselves which led to Lea and Holder writing "[[Coz I Luv You]]". The song was written in half an hour and started a writing partnership which would continue throughout Slade's career. Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one. While recording, the band felt the song's sound to be too soft, and so clapping and bootstamping were added. The song's misspelled title also became a trademark for Slade while causing a furore among British school teachers.<ref name="autogenerated8">Slade's Greatest Hits compilation booklet</ref> The attendant appearance on [[BBC]] Television's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' brought Slade to a wider audience as well as pushing "Coz I Luv You" to number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=UKCharts/> In November 1971, ''[[NME]]'' reported that Slade had turned down a multimillion-dollar campaign, including a television series and a heavily promoted tour of the US. "But", commented Holder, "acceptance would have meant the cancellation of many commitments here – and the last thing we want to do is to mess around the people who have put us where we are".<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book | first= John | last= Tobler | year= 1992 | title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years | edition= 1st | publisher= Reed International Books Ltd | location= London | page= 232 | id= CN 5585}}</ref>

A second single entitled "[[Look Wot You Dun]]", was released at the start of 1972, peaking at number four and a live album was released in March.<ref name=UKCharts/> The album ''[[Slade Alive!]]'' proved to be successful, spending 52 weeks in the [[UK Albums Chart]], peaking at number two.<ref name="officialcharts.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/30945/slade/|title=SLADE|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=23 April 2016}}</ref> It also did well abroad, topping the Australian chart and giving the band their first chart entry in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poparchives.com.au/home.php |title=Home – Pop Archives – Sources of Australian Pop Records from the 50s, 60s and 70s |publisher=Pop Archives |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/slade-p5449/charts-awards/billboard-albums |title=Slade |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=25 June 2002 |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> The album was recorded over three nights at a newly built studio in [[Piccadilly]] in front of 300 fan-club members.<ref name="Charlesworth"/><ref>Slade Alive anthology compilation booklet</ref> Today the album is regarded as one of the finest live albums ever made.<ref name="allmusic5449"/>

Two months later, the band released "[[Take Me Bak 'Ome]]". The single became Slade's second UK number one and charted in a number of other countries, including the United States, where it reached number 97 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=UKCharts/><ref name="allmusic2">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/slade-p5449/charts-awards/billboard-singles |title=Slade |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=25 June 2002 |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> Slade achieved their third number one when "[[Mama Weer All Crazee Now]]" was released later that year.<ref name=UKCharts/>

Released in November 1972, the album ''[[Slayed?]]'' peaked at number one both in the UK and Australia, where it relegated ''Slade Alive'' to the second spot;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sladefanclub.weebly.com/1973.html|title=Fan Club Newsletter April – May 1973|page=2|access-date=14 September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822023015/http://sladefanclub.weebly.com/1973.html|archive-date=22 August 2011}}

In early 1973, "[[Cum on Feel the Noize]]" was released and went straight to number one,<ref name=UKCharts/> the first time a single had done so since [[The Beatles]]' "[[Get Back]]" in 1969. Another worldwide hit for Slade, the single again failed to impress in America where it made number 98.<ref name="allmusic2"/> The follow-up single "[[Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me]]", again went straight to number one.<ref name=UKCharts/> Despite being a hit single, "Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me" was never performed on ''Top of the Pops'' because the producers of the show would not allow Slade to perform as a three-piece band. A promotional video with dancers was shown instead. A car crash in Wolverhampton on 4 July 1973 left Powell in a coma and his 20-year-old girlfriend, Angela Morris, dead.<ref>{{cite web |author=asks James Carpenter |url=https://www.expressandstar.com/latest/2006/10/12/those-crazee-days-recalled/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241214191845/https://www.expressandstar.com/latest/2006/10/12/those-crazee-days-recalled/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 December 2024 |title=Those crazee days recalled " Express & Star |website=Expressandstar.com |date=12 October 2006 |access-date=15 July 2011 }}</ref> The band's future was left in the balance as Slade refused to continue without their drummer; however, Lea's brother, Frank, covered Powell's position at the [[Isle of Man Festival]] to avoid disappointing fans. Powell, who had suffered breaks to both ankles and five ribs, successfully recovered after surgery and was able to rejoin the band ten weeks later in New York, where they recorded "[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]" – in the middle of a heatwave.<ref name="Holder"/> Powell still suffers with acute short-term memory loss and sensory problems as a result of the accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slade40years.cms4people.de/slade_don_powell.html |title=SLADE40YEARS – Don Powell |website=Slade40years.cms4people.de |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> Whilst Powell was recovering, and in an attempt to keep up momentum, the band released a compilation album ''[[Sladest]]'', which topped the UK and Australian charts in the first week of its release.<ref name=UKCharts/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poparchives.com.au/gosetcharts/ |title=GO-SET Magazine – Australian singles and album charts, 1966–1974 |website=Poparchives.com.au |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> A new single, "[[My Friend Stan (song)|My Friend Stan]]", was also released. It marked a change from previous records, being more piano based and sounding more like a [[novelty song]].

[[File:Slade.png|thumb|The band in 1973]]
The Christmas-themed song "[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]" was Slade's last single of 1973 and became the band's last number one in the UK.<ref name=UKCharts/> Prompted by a challenge from Lea's mother-in-law to write a seasonal song, the chorus was the melody from a discarded song written by Holder six years previously. It became Slade's best-selling single. The song has remained popular and has been released many times since, charting on a number of occasions.<ref name=UKCharts/>

The band began to experiment with different musical styles, moving away from their usual successful rock anthems. Following the success of "My Friend Stan", Slade released the album ''[[Old, New, Borrowed and Blue]]'', in February 1974 which went to number one in the UK.<ref name=UKCharts/> Re-titled ''Stomp Your Hands, Clap Your Feet'', the album was another disappointment in the US, failing to break into the top 100.<ref name="allmusic1"/> The following month saw a new single released. "[[Everyday (Slade song)|Everyday]]" was a piano led ballad which made number three in the UK chart.<ref name=UKCharts/> The next single, "[[The Bangin' Man]]" saw a return to a more guitar-based sound, again reaching the number three position.<ref name=UKCharts/>

===Decline in popularity (1974–1975)===
In the latter half of 1974, the possibility of making a film was being discussed. The band considered a number of screenplays before settling on ''[[Slade in Flame]]'', a gritty tale of the rise and fall of a fictional 1960s group called Flame; the story was based on true music business events involving Slade and various other groups of the time.<ref name="Charlesworth"/> A track from the film was released, "[[Far Far Away (song)|Far Far Away]]"; this reached number two in the UK and topped the charts in Norway and other parts of Scandinavia.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://norwegiancharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Slade&titel=Far+Far+Away&cat=s |title=Slade – Far Far Away |website=Norwegiancharts.com |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref>  Holder has cited the single as his favourite Slade song.<ref name="Holder"/>

The [[Slade in Flame (album)|soundtrack album]] was released in late November and despite a positive reception from the critics, the disappointing chart position of number six was seen by some as an indication of the band's decline in popularity.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/><ref name="autogenerated7">Slade in Flame remastered booklet</ref> The film, released in January 1975, received a somewhat mixed reception. Critics loved it, but it was thought that its bleak, noir atmosphere confused Slade fans who were used to Slade delivering a good time.<ref name="Charlesworth"/> Directed by [[Richard Loncraine]] and written by [[Andrew Birkin]], the film featured [[Tom Conti]] in his first major film role.<ref name="Charlesworth"/>

The number 15 position of the film's main theme song, "[[How Does It Feel (Slade song)|How Does It Feel]]", was seen as further proof of the band's decline.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The ballad, featuring brass instruments and flute, was at the time thought to be too far from the fans' expectations.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> [[Noel Gallagher]] of the British band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] however has claimed the track to be, "one of the best songs written, in the history of pop, ever".<ref>1999 It's Slade Documentary</ref> The follow-up in May "[[Thanks for the Memory (Wham Bam Thank You Mam)]]" fared slightly better, peaking at number seven in the UK and doing well in a number of other European countries.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Slade&titel=Thanks+For+The+Memory+(Wham+Bam+Thank+You+Mam)&cat=s|title=Slade - Thanks For The Memory (Wham Bam Thank You Mam) - austriancharts.at|date=4 November 2012|access-date=28 October 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104202933/http://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Slade&titel=Thanks+For+The+Memory+(Wham+Bam+Thank+You+Mam)&cat=s|archive-date=4 November 2012}}</ref> The single became Slade's last top 10 hit of the 1970s.

===Stateside (1975–1977)===
By mid-1975, the band had become disillusioned with their lack of success in America. Feeling that they were becoming stale and had achieved all they could in Europe, Slade decided to a make a permanent move to the States and try to build a solid reputation from live performances; just as they had previously done in the UK. According to the Slade Fan Club newsletter of August and September 1975, the band took twelve tons of equipment, worth approximately £45,000 at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/1507704_orig.jpg |title=Thanks for the Memory |website=Sladefanclub.com |access-date=23 April 2014}}</ref><ref>Slade Fan Club Newsletter August – September 1975</ref> Throughout the remainder of 1975 and 1976, Slade toured the US, often with other bands such as [[Aerosmith]], [[ZZ Top]] and [[Black Sabbath]], only returning to the UK for TV performances of new singles.

Between tours, Holder and Lea began writing for a new album which was heavily influenced by the US and aimed at an American audience. The group booked themselves into New York's [[Record Plant Studios]] in mid-1975 to record the album ''[[Nobody's Fools (album)|Nobody's Fools]]''.<ref name="Charlesworth"/><ref>Nobody's Fools remastered booklet</ref> Featuring backing vocals from [[Tasha Thomas]], it contained elements of [[soul music|soul]], [[country music|country]] and [[funk]] music.<ref name="Charlesworth"/> The first two singles from the new album, "[[In For a Penny]]" and "[[Let's Call It Quits (song)|Let's Call It Quits]]"  were released in November 1975 and January 1976 respectively, both made number 11 in the UK chart although the latter made no impression outside of the UK.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The album, released in March 1976, failed to make any impact in America and was also a disappointment in the UK where it peaked at number 14 and dropped out of the chart completely after four weeks.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The final track from the album was the title track "[[Nobody's Fool (Slade song)|Nobody's Fool]]". Released in April, it failed to chart at all, the first to do so since the band's rise to fame in 1971.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> Fans within the UK accused the band of 'selling out' and forgetting about their fan base at home.<ref name="Charlesworth"/>

===Wilderness years (1977–1980)===
[[File:Slade 18041977 01 400.jpg|thumb|Slade performing in Norway in 1977.]]
Overall, Slade's American venture was seen as a failure, although the band felt improved and rejuvenated.<ref name="Charlesworth"/> The live success in many cities such as St. Louis, Philadelphia, and New York was not translated into US airplay, however, and the band returned to the UK at the beginning of 1977 to find that [[punk rock]] was the new popular style of rock and that they were largely forgotten and out of fashion.<ref>Slade's remastered album Nobody's Fools booklet</ref> Chandler decided not to renew the band's contract with [[Polydor Records]], instead signing them to his own record label, [[Barn Records]].<ref name="Charlesworth"/>

The band's first release with Barn Records was the single "[[Gypsy Roadhog]]", in January 1977. The track was performed on the children's show ''[[Blue Peter]]'', but complaints arose due to supposed drug references and the record was subsequently banned by the [[BBC]].<ref name="autogenerated3">Whatever Happened to Slade remastered booklet</ref> This in turn led to the single's stalling at number 48 in the UK chart.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The title of the subsequent album was taken from a piece of graffiti seen in London, and made reference to the band's current position in the public eye: ''[[Whatever Happened to Slade]]'' was released in March and failed to make any chart appearance in the UK.<ref name="Charlesworth"/> Chandler was reportedly disappointed in the material that Holder and Lea were writing, claiming that the album was not commercial enough, but despite its lack of mainstream success, the album was met with critical praise and support from the English punk movement of the time.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Since their return to the UK, the band continued to tour but mainly in smaller venues such as universities and clubs.

"Burning in the Heat of Love", released a month later, also failed to chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/2014106 |title=Slade - Burning In The Heat Of Love / Ready Steady Kids - Barn - UK - 2014 106 |website=45cat.com |access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> In October, the band released an amalgamation of two Arthur Crudup songs, entitled "[[My Baby Left Me#Slade version|My Baby Left Me/]] [[That's All Right]]" as a tribute to the recent death of [[Elvis Presley]]. The single proved to be a moderate success, peaking at number 32 in the UK.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> Slade was unable to keep momentum for the next single, "[[Give Us a Goal]]", released in March 1978. Based on English [[football chant]]s, it was intended to appeal to fans of the sport but failed to make any impact,<ref name="Charlesworth"/> other than making the airplay-based charts of Radio Luxembourg and Manchester's Piccadilly Radio. It has however been used in successful advertising campaigns in recent years.

In August 1978, Holder was reportedly involved in a brawl with a bouncer (Desmond Brothers) backstage at The Stoneleigh Club in [[Porthcawl]], [[South Wales]]. The bouncer was later jailed for three months for instigating the attack on Holder, after he had told the club bouncers to stop hurting the kids in the crowd who were pushed up against the stage, during the show. Holder showed his mettle by performing the next night as planned, although he had a broken nose, at a club in [[Cleethorpes]], Lincolnshire. The story of the attack would later be written into the 1981 single "Knuckle Sandwich Nancy", which Holder insisted would be released as a single. The band said in contemporary interviews that RCA and Chas Chandler objected to the single's release, so it came out on the [[Cheapskate Records|Cheapskate]] label, rather than on RCA, the label that they were contracted to.

In late 1978, the band released "[[Rock 'n' Roll Bolero]]", which was another commercial failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/2014127be |title=Slade - Rock 'n' Roll Bolero / It's Alright Buy Me - Barn - Belgium - 2014 127 |website=45cat.com |access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> As the band were still a respected live act, and because the 1972 album ''Slade Alive!'' had been so successful, the group decided to release another live album. ''[[Slade Alive, Vol. 2]]'' consisted of performances recorded during the 1976 Autumn tour of America and the 1977 Spring tour of the UK.

In 1979, the band released a further three singles: "[[Ginny, Ginny]]", "[[Sign of the Times (Slade song)|Sign of the Times]]" and a cover of the party track "[[Hokey Cokey|Okey Cokey]]". All failed to chart. The Slade newsletter of the time announced that "Ginny, Ginny" had made the top 200 in the UK but not the official top 100.<ref>{{citation|title=From Roots To Boots!: Slade News Issue 4 |date=10 September 1950}}</ref> In October 1979, the band released a new studio album ''[[Return to Base]]'', the first album not to have Chandler as producer.<ref>{{cite book |title=Slade, Feel the Noize!: an illustrated biography |last=Charlesworth |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Charlesworth |year=1984 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London |isbn=0-7119-0538-X |pages=89–90 }}</ref> Disagreements between Lea and Chandler, centring on business problems and Lea's desire to produce Slade's material, had been brewing since the recording of ''Whatever Happened to Slade'' in 1977. Lea in particular disagreed with Chandler on production decisions. As a result, Chandler offered to sever his association with the band. Slade, not wishing to be rid of Chandler entirely, asked him to stay on for the time being as their manager, which Chandler agreed to do.<ref>We'll Bring the House Down remastered booklet</ref> The album was a failure in the UK but the following year it topped both the Telemoustique chart and the official album chart in Belgium.{{who|date=November 2011}} Released exclusively in Belgium, the album's version of [[Chuck Berry]]'s "I'm a Rocker" also made number 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/6602796_orig.jpg|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720214503/http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/6602796_orig.jpg|url-status=dead|title=6602796_orig.jpg (562x800 pixels)|archive-date=20 July 2012|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref><ref>Supporters Club Newsletter September – October 1981</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sladefanclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/3275309_orig.jpg |title=3275309_orig.JPG (561x800 pixels) |access-date=18 October 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715021744/http://sladefanclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/3275309_orig.jpg |archive-date=15 July 2012 }}</ref>

Slade's failures and lack of airplay led Lea to wonder if their material would be better received if recorded by another band. In late 1979, Lea formed [[The Dummies]] as a side project, with his brother Frank. They released three singles, which received plenty of radio airplay but sales suffered from distribution problems.<ref name="Charlesworth"/> In February 1980, Holder was briefly considered as a replacement for [[Bon Scott]], the recently deceased singer of [[AC/DC]]. Holder was said to have turned the position down, despite Slade's current situation, because of his loyalty to the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |title=noddy holder interview – at |website=Soundchecks.co.uk |access-date=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405014451/http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |archive-date=5 April 2005 }}</ref> In mid-1980, Slade released their first [[extended play]] titled "[[Six of the Best (EP)|Six of the Best]]" which featured three tracks from the ''Return to Base'' album and three brand new rock tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/ep/slade/six_of_the_best/ |title=Six of the Best by Slade : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> Even though it was being sold for a lower than usual price of £1.49, it still failed to sell enough to make a chart appearance. As a result, the band stopped working together and Hill started driving couples to their weddings in his own [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]], to earn money. The business never really took off, as Hill only drove one couple (a pair of fans).<ref name="Charlesworth"/>

Hill later recalled that during this period Slade "played the difficult gigs, the gigs where people have [[In a basket|chicken in a basket]] and then go on the dancefloor" but noted that they "had an armour of fantastic songs so nobody was going to argue with [them]."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hattenstone|first=Simon|author-link=Simon Hattenstone|date=8 March 2021|title=Slade guitarist Dave Hill: 'I'd come out of work, put on my costume and suddenly I'd be Superman!'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/08/slade-guitarist-dave-hill-stroke-depression-glam-rock|access-date=17 April 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

===Comeback and heavy metal following (1980–1982)===
[[File:Slade at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|Slade performing at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff in December 1981.]]
[[Ozzy Osbourne]] was due to play the Reading Festival in August 1980, during his [[Blizzard of Ozz]] tour, but cancelled at short notice as his band was not ready, leaving the organisers searching for a last-minute replacement. Slade were suggested, but Hill, still demoralised, had effectively left the band and initially refused to take part when asked by the other band members. Eventually, Chandler went to his home and convinced Hill to play what should have been a farewell performance in front of 65,000 rock fans. Instead of Slade's disbanding and disappearing without a trace, to Hill's astonishment, the band stole the show and quickly became the darlings of the music press and radio. Highlights of their performance were broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''[[Friday Rock Show]]'' Reading special. Afterwards, the band signed to Cheapskate Records, owned by Chandler, Lea and his brother Frank, which gave the band more control of their material and products.<ref name="Charlesworth"/><ref name="Holder" />

The band's new-found success led to a hurriedly released extended play, ''[[Alive at Reading]]'', which reached number 44, the band's first chart action in the UK since 1977. Another extended play followed in November, titled "[[Xmas Ear Bender (EP)|Xmas Ear Bender]]" which peaked at number 70.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/cheap11 |title=Various Artists – Xmas Ear Bender – Cheapskate – CHEAP 11 |website=45cat.com |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> Polydor Records also saw an opportunity to capitalise on the band's new success and released the compilation ''[[Slade Smashes!]]'' at the beginning of November. The album was given plenty of promotion and spent 15 weeks in the UK chart, peaking at number 21.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The album was certified UK Gold in December, having by then sold over 200,000 copies.<ref name="autogenerated11">We'll Bring the House Down remaster booklet</ref>

Keen to keep momentum with their new fans, the band set out to write a song with hit potential. The idea for the new track came after a performance in [[Amsterdam]] at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] Club. An enthusiastic audience who would not go home were overheard chanting by Lea, who was downstairs in the dressing room. Realising the potential of the chant, the song "[[We'll Bring the House Down (song)|We'll Bring the House Down]]" was written and released in January 1981. Aimed at the new audience which consisted of mainly [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans, it showed Slade's heavier rock sound.<ref name="Charlesworth"/><ref name="autogenerated18">Greatest Hits compilation booklet</ref> The single hit the number 10 spot in the UK, becoming Slade's first top ten hit since 1976.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> In March, an album consisting of four new tracks and six tracks from the previous album ''Return to Base'' was released. Also called ''[[We'll Bring the House Down]]'' it peaked at number 25.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/><ref name=autogenerated11 />

"[[Wheels Ain't Coming Down]]", which originally appeared as the opening track on the album ''Return to Base'', was released in March 1981 and reached number 60 in the UK. Although not a hit, it served to keep Slade in the public eye while they were writing new material and planning a European tour.<ref name="Charlesworth"/> Slade's success at the 1980 Reading festival was helping them fill large venues<ref name=autogenerated15 /> and led to their being asked about a return in 1981. The band refused to return so soon, and opted to play the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington.

In May, the band released "[[Knuckle Sandwich Nancy]]" which featured lyrics commenting on the assault on Holder in the Welsh nightclub. Although eagerly wanted as a single by the band, Chandler was not entirely convinced and thus it was half-heartedly released and failed to chart. The band blamed Chandler for losing interest, and began to manage themselves. Chandler sold his share of Cheapskate Records and negotiated a favourable deal for the band with [[RCA Records]].<ref name="Charlesworth"/><ref name="autogenerated15">Till Deaf Do Us Part remaster booklet</ref> The new deal meant that Slade's records would get worldwide release except in the US and Canada. The next couple of UK singles were still released under the Cheapskate label but with RCA pressing and distributing the records, then a full RCA release could start.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/5494355_orig.jpg|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714230258/http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/5494355_orig.jpg|url-status=dead|title=5494355_orig.jpg (534x800 pixels)|archive-date=14 July 2012|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref>

The band's first full release on the RCA label was the European hit single "[[Lock Up Your Daughters (song)|Lock Up Your Daughters]]" in late 1981. The track continued to follow a more [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound and made number 29 in the UK.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The album ''[[Till Deaf Do Us Part]]'' followed in November 1981 and peaked at number 68. It remains Slade's most metal-directed and heaviest sounding album to date.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ginsberg |first=Geoff |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/till-deaf-do-us-part-r49496 |title=Till Deaf Do Us Part – Slade |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> An article in ''[[NME]]'' shortly after release claimed Slade were in trouble over the album cover, which featured an 'offensive' picture of a nail piercing an ear drum, and that many dealers were refusing to stock it.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd| location= London| page= 364| id= CN 5585}}</ref> The cover was later changed on the CD reissue to a picture of the band in flames. In December, RCA released "[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]" for the first time since its initial outing. This time, however, it only managed to get to number 32.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/>

By early 1982, the band had released a new single from the ''[[Till Deaf Do Us Part]]'' album, "[[Ruby Red (song)|Ruby Red]]". Although a [[gatefold]] release with two extra live tracks, it only managed to reach 51 in the UK chart.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The opening track from the album, "[[Rock and Roll Preacher]]" was released exclusively in Germany in April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/pb5466 |title=Slade - Rock And Roll Preacher (Hallelujah I'm On Fire) / Knuckle Sandwich Nancy - RCA Victor - Germany - PB 5466 |website=45cat.com |date=23 October 2017 |access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> The first Slade single to have a [[12-inch single|12" single]] version, it peaked at number 49.<ref name="musicline1">{{cite web|url=http://musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/SLADE/single|title=Die ganze Musik im Internet: Charts|date=19 December 2013|access-date=28 October 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219051613/http://musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/SLADE/single|archive-date=19 December 2013}}</ref> The song also became Slade's new show opener. In November, the band released a new single, "[[(And Now the Waltz) C'est La Vie]]", which was aimed directly at the Christmas market. It only made number 50 in the UK but was a hit in Poland where it reached number two.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/ |title=Polskie Radio – najlepsze radio online w internecie |website=Polskieradio.pl |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> The band's version of the party track "[[Hokey Cokey|Okey Cokey]]" was also re-released that year but failed to make an impact, much like the original release in 1979. Lastly, "[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]" was again re-released, this time only managing to get to number 67.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> December saw the release of Slade's third and final live album, ''[[Slade on Stage]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/rcalp3107 |title=Vinyl Album - Slade - Slade On Stage - RCA - UK |website=45worlds.com |access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> which peaked at number 58 in the UK but received a positive response from critics.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> Lea continued working on solo projects throughout despite the upturn in Slade's fortunes.

===American breakthrough (1983–1984)===
Although Slade enjoyed some minor success, RCA Records had higher expectations and sent them away to write songs to be considered for release in 1983. The band came back with two possible singles, "[[My Oh My (Slade song)|My Oh My]]" and "[[Run Runaway]]". A raw demo of Holder singing "My Oh My" over Lea's piano was received with particular enthusiasm by RCA. The label was delighted with both the tracks and hired outside producer [[John Punter]] to work with the band to record them. This was the first time the band had another producer since Chandler. Punter's methods differed from those Slade were used to, in that the band recorded all their parts separately. This method eventually met with the band's approval, except for Holder, who believed this method was ruining their unique chemistry and was losing their rock and roll edge.<ref>The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome remastered album</ref> The power ballad "My Oh My" was released in November 1983, where it slowly climbed the charts and by December, Slade found themselves competing for the Christmas number 1 spot. The single peaked at number 2 behind [[a cappella]] group [[The Flying Pickets]] with their cover of [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo's]] "[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]".<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The single was a success across Europe and topped the charts in Norway and Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Slade&titel=My+Oh+My&cat=s|title=Slade - My Oh My - austriancharts.at|date=22 November 2011|access-date=28 October 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122022307/http://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Slade&titel=My+Oh+My&cat=s|archive-date=22 November 2011}}</ref> "[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]", again re-released, made number 20 that year.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/>

In late 1983, Holder joined Lea in record production producing, among other things, [[Girlschool]]'s cover of the [[T-Rex (band)|T-Rex]] song "[[20th Century Boy]]" and the album ''[[Play Dirty (album)|Play Dirty]]'' which featured two Slade tracks, "Burning in the Heat of Love" and "High and Dry".<ref name="usuarios.multimania.es">{{cite web|url=http://usuarios.multimania.es/JimLea/portadas/discografia_ingles.html|title=discografia_ingles|date=6 April 2012|access-date=28 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406225657/http://usuarios.multimania.es/JimLea/portadas/discografia_ingles.html|archive-date=6 April 2012}}</ref> Toward the end of the year, American [[glam metal]] band [[Quiet Riot]] released a cover version of "[[Cum on Feel the Noize]]" on [[Pasha Records]] and distributed by [[Columbia Records]].

Its success, it has been suggested, was partly due to the accompanying music video which was filmed at [[Eastnor Castle]] in [[Ledbury]], Herefordshire, England and was heavily shown on the MTV music channel.<ref name="autogenerated4"/> In August 1984, "My Oh My" was released in the US as a follow-up; it peaked at number 37 for a total of 11 weeks, again with the help of a heavily rotated music video on MTV.<ref name="billboard3"/> Quiet Riot meanwhile released another Slade song, "[[Mama Weer All Crazee Now]]", which peaked at number 51.<ref name="billboard1"/>

===Second decline in popularity (1985–1990)===
In mid-1984, Polydor released a new compilation, ''[[Slade's Greats]]'', which peaked at number 89, and during the autumn a full European tour was announced to promote the album.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> Tickets were being sold before the band had agreed that the tour would actually take place: shortly afterwards, it was cancelled because Holder, who was facing a divorce from his first wife, was furious arrangements for the tour had gone ahead without his agreement.<ref name="Holder"/><ref>Rogues Galley remaster booklet</ref><ref name="autogenerated5">{{cite web|url=http://www.crazeeworld.plus.com/slade/2011/pages/interviews.htm|title=SLADE @ www.slayed.co.uk|date=15 July 2011|access-date=28 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715094253/http://www.crazeeworld.plus.com/slade/2011/pages/interviews.htm|archive-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> In late 1984, a new single, similar in style to "[[My Oh My (Slade song)|My Oh My]]" was released in the UK.

At the beginning of 1985, Slade released the single "[[7 Year Bitch (song)|7 Year Bitch]]" which stalled at number 60 in the UK when it failed to make radio playlists.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The band protested that there had been no reaction to [[Elton John]]'s "[[The Bitch Is Back]]" which was a hit record.<ref name="autogenerated10">Rogues Gallery remaster booklet</ref> The single did make number 39 in the German chart.<ref name="musicline1"/> A following single was released in March entitled "[[Myzsterious Mizster Jones]]".

''[[Rogues Gallery (album)|Rogues Gallery]]'', an album heavily reliant on Lea playing on synthesizer and the majority of instruments, was released in the UK during March, and in America during May. Reported to be one of the band's most polished productions, the band aimed to produce an album where all tracks were potential hit singles.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> Despite receiving critical acclaim in both Europe and America, the album failed to live up to commercial expectations, partly due to the lack of live appearances, and Slade were unable to retain their new-found American audience or rekindled British following, causing the band to largely fade from sight once more. In the UK, the album reached number 60,<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> whilst in America it made number 132.<ref name="billboard3"/> The album was a hit in Norway, peaking at number 5.

In November, the band released a party album called ''[[Crackers (album)|Crackers – The Christmas Party Album]]'' which peaked at number 34 and was certified UK gold sales later that month.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> Repackaged on several occasions under various names such as ''The Party Album'' and ''Slade's Crazee Christmas''; it contained Slade hits and songs that had been successful for other artists.<ref name=autogenerated17 /> Amazed at what [[Bob Geldof]] had achieved with [[Live Aid]], Holder penned the lyrics to "[[Do You Believe in Miracles (song)|Do You Believe in Miracles]]" which was also released in November.<ref name=autogenerated10 /> The single's earnings went to charity but it only peaked at number 54 in the UK.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The final release of the year was another re-release of "Merry Xmas Everybody" which peaked at number 48 in the UK.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/>

In 1986, two new Slade tracks, "We Won't Give In" and "Wild Wild Party", were used for the British film, ''Knights & Emeralds''.<ref>[[IMDbTitle:0091350|Knights & Emeralds (1986) – IMDb]]</ref> That same year, the rock band The Redbeards From Texas released a cover of the 1972 Slade hit, "Gudbuy T'Jane" and in late 1986; "Okey Cokey" was re-released for the second time but failed to chart, whilst "Merry Xmas Everybody" was once again re-released, peaking at number 71.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> 1986 also saw Slade's first official fan convention at the Finsbury Leisure Centre, Old Street, London.<ref name="davekempandslade81">{{cite web|url=http://www.davekempandslade.com/page81.htm|title=Dave Kemp and Slade website - Conventions|date=27 December 2010|access-date=28 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227070722/http://www.davekempandslade.com/page81.htm|archive-date=27 December 2010}}</ref>

To avoid becoming a 'Christmas' hit band, Slade did not release the single "[[Still the Same (Slade song)|Still the Same]]" in December 1986 but left it until February 1987.<ref name="autogenerated16"/> The single was not a major hit, reaching number 73 in the UK, leaving RCA wondering whether it might have been a better idea to release it at Christmas.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/><ref name="autogenerated16">You Boyz Make Big Noize remaster booklet</ref> Released in April, "[[That's What Friends Are For (Slade song)|That's What Friends Are For]]" suffered a similar fate, peaking at number 95.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> Slade's final studio album, ''[[You Boyz Make Big Noize]]'', was released a week later.

Following the album's failure, RCA agreed to let Slade return to their own Cheapskate Records label, although RCA still continued distributing. A new single, also called "[[You Boyz Make Big Noize (song)|You Boyz Make Big Noize]]" was released in August.

===Brief comeback and break-up (1991–1992)===
In April 1991, the Slade fan club-organised a 25th anniversary party. The band, who were invited, played one song, [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Johnny B. Goode]]" which turned out to be their last live performance.<ref>[http://www.crazeeworld.plus.com/slade/2011/chronology/chronology90s.htm] {{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In that same year, Lea produced the single "Where Have All the Good Girls Gone" for the Crybabys, which was not a success.<ref name="usuarios.multimania.es"/> Later, Polydor Records contacted Slade about a new compilation album. It was hoped that Slade would promote it by releasing two brand new singles and, if successful, would record a new studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crazeeworld.plus.com/slade/2011/pages/trivia.htm|title=SLADE @ www.slayed.co.uk|date=15 July 2011|access-date=28 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715093715/http://www.crazeeworld.plus.com/slade/2011/pages/trivia.htm|archive-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> The first single, "[[Radio Wall of Sound]]", written by Lea and originally intended for a solo project, was released in October.<ref name=autogenerated18 /> The compilation album, ''[[Wall of Hits]]'' was released the following month, along with a video compilation under the [[Wall of Hits (video)|same name]]. Both the single and the album were moderately successful reaching number 21 and number 34 respectively.<ref name="officialcharts.com"/> The album later went certified UK silver and in an attempt to promote it further, a second single, "[[Universe (Slade song)|Universe]]" was released in December. Despite a number of TV performances, the single failed to reach the top 100 of the UK Singles Chart. As a result, in January 1992, Polydor withdrew the option for a new album and future singles.<ref name="Holder"/>

In March 1992, the band returned to Rich Bitch Studios to record a new house/dance-style version of "We'll Bring the House Down". However, by the end of the month, Holder had decided to finally leave the band. He had become weary of the constant arguing and discontent within the band, and effectively managing their day-to-day affairs. He left after 26 years with the band to explore other career paths.<ref name="Look Wot I Dun">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jj_AgAAQBAJ&q=%22walk+this+way%22+don+powell&pg=PT335|title=Look Wot I Dun: Don Powell of Slade|first1=Don|last1=Powell|first2=Lise Lyng|last2=Falkenberg|date=11 October 2013|publisher=Omnibus Press|access-date=28 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1-78323-000-6}}</ref> Lea briefly considered Slade continuing with a new singer and thought about approaching [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]], but ultimately chose to retire from the band as well.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Blake |first=Mark |title=The Cult Heroes: Look Wot You Dun |magazine=[[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]] |date=October 2019 |issue=16 |page=71 |issn=2514-4626}}</ref> Powell filled the gap by helping out in a hotel his partner managed, but would soon re-join Hill to form Slade II later in the year.<ref name="Look Wot I Dun"/>

===Aftermath and recent years (1993–present)===
[[File:Slade - Sofia Rocks 2011 - 2.jpg|thumb|right|Slade performing in 2011, From left to right: John Berry, [[Dave Hill (guitarist)|Dave Hill]] and [[Mal McNulty]].]]Slade II was formed in 1992 by Hill with Powell and three other musicians - Craig Fenney (bass), Steve Makin (guitar) and Steve Whalley (lead vocals and guitar). The suggestion to call the group Slade II came from Holder, but Lea was not happy with the Slade name being used at all. The group's name was only shortened to Slade again ten years later. Working solidly on the UK theatre circuit during the winter months and throughout Europe the rest of the year, the band released one studio album in 1994 entitled ''[[Keep on Rockin' (Slade II album)|Keep on Rockin']]'', which featured Steve Whalley on vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/album-groupe-Slade-nom_album-Keep_on_Rockin_-l-en.html |title=Keep on Rockin !

The band have seen many line-ups (including Dave Glover on bass, plus present incumbents Mal McNulty on guitar and vocals and John Berry on bass and vocals) but Hill and Powell have remained constant throughout.<ref name="Holder"/>

Slade were reunited for two events during 1996: the funeral of long-time Slade manager [[Chas Chandler]] and an episode of the television show ''[[This Is Your Life (British TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' which featured Holder as the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crazeeworld.plus.com/slade/2011/members/chas.htm|title=SLADE @ www.slayed.co.uk|date=20 October 2011|access-date=28 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020225735/http://www.crazeeworld.plus.com/slade/2011/members/chas.htm|archive-date=20 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/this-is-your-life-uk/noddy-holder/episode/777937/summary.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913042046/http://www.tv.com/this-is-your-life-uk/noddy-holder/episode/777937/summary.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 September 2012 |title=This is Your Life (UK): Noddy Holder Episode Summary on |website=Tv.com |date=3 September 2008 |access-date=15 July 2011 }}</ref> Also in 1996, a compilation entitled ''[[The Genesis of Slade]]'' was released, which contained rare and some previously unreleased material from The Vendors, Steve Brett & The Mavericks and The 'N Betweens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/cdalbum/cd/tmc9606 |title=CD Album - The Vendors / Steve Brett And The Mavericks / The 'N Betweens - The Genesis Of Slade - TMC - Austria |website=45worlds.com |date=12 May 2014 |access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> During 1997, a new Slade compilation, ''[[Feel the Noize- Greatest Hits|Feel the Noize – Greatest Hits]]'', reached number 19 in the UK, while in the following year, a remix of "[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]", released under the name Slade Vs.

The 1969 album ''[[Beginnings (Ambrose Slade album)|Beginnings]]'', released under the name Ambrose Slade, featured many songs that basically comprised their live act with covers of psychedelic rock and classic 1960s rocksongs by [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Ted Nugent]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Moody Blues]], [[The Beatles]] and [[Marvin Gaye]].

''[[Play It Loud]]'' (1970), the first album that was released as Slade, showed more of a progressive rock sound.

Their 1972 live album, ''[[Slade Alive!]]'', featured cover versions of songs by [[Ten Years After]], [[The Lovin' Spoonful]], [[Bobby Marchan]] and [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] and is considered a strong classic rock effort. Their sound was toughening up and they would soon find their classic sound and commence the tremendously successful Holder / Lea songwriting partnership.

The 1971 single "[[Coz I Luv You]]", and the 1973 B-side [[Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me|Kill 'Em At The Hot Club Tonite]] were inspired by the [[Gypsy jazz|gypsy swing]] of the [[Quintette du Hot Club de France]], especially the guitar and violin styles of [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[Stéphane Grappelli]].<ref>Slade's 1997 Greatest Hits compilation booklet</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sladest - Record Collector Magazine|url=https://recordcollectormag.com/reviews/sladest|website=[[Record Collector]]|first=Terry|last=Staunton}}</ref>

''[[Slayed?]]'' (1972) merged glam rock with classic rock, and whilst the 1974 album, ''[[Old New Borrowed and Blue]]'', continued in this vein, it also featured pop-rock, rock ballads and novelty tracks.<ref name="perseverancesite.co.uk">{{cite web |title=The Music |url=http://www.perseverancesite.co.uk/slade/themusic/index.htm |website=Perseverancesite.co.uk |access-date=28 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210411031507/http://www.perseverancesite.co.uk/slade/themusic/index.htm |archive-date=11 April 2021 |language=en}}</ref> The next album was the 1974 soundtrack ''[[Slade in Flame]]'' which saw a return to 1960s classic rock, to fit with the theme of the film. The single from the album, "[[Far Far Away (song)|Far Far Away]]" had an acoustic rock sound, whereas the following single "[[How Does It Feel (Slade song)|How Does It Feel?]]" featured the use of brass and woodwind instruments.<ref name="autogenerated8"/>

In 1975, while residing in the States, Slade was influenced by Southern boogie rock bands and as a result, ''[[Nobody's Fools (album)|Nobody's Fools]]'' featured a wide mixture of styles including soul, country, rock, funk, folk and blues. The album also featured some soulful female backing vocalists.<ref>Slade Salvo remastered album Nobody's Fools booklet</ref> After the band returned to the UK in 1977, they began to merge their American influences with a classic, hard rock. ''[[Return to Base]]'' (1979) featured elements of classic rock, acoustic rock, rock ballads, ambient rock and rock and roll.<ref name="ReferenceA">Slade Salvo remastered album We'll Bring the House Down booklet</ref> Two albums, released in 1981; ''[[We'll Bring the House Down]]'' and ''[[Till Deaf Do Us Part]]'' adopted a hard rock and heavy metal sound, as a result of the band's revival amongst heavy metal fans, following their success at the Reading Festival.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The 1983 album ''[[The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome]]'' featured a change in musical direction, with a more commercial-friendly rock sound on some tracks, mixed with hard rock and glam metal influences. Some of the tracks hinted at a motor racing theme.<ref name="perseverancesite.co.uk"/> One single from the album, "[[My Oh My (Slade song)|My Oh My]]" followed a power ballad sound, whilst the next single, "[[Run Runaway]]" was reminiscent of a Scottish jig. Slade's next album, ''[[Rogues Gallery (album)|Rogues Gallery]]'' featured a strong use of synthesisers, which were a popular instrument in the latter half of the 1980s as did the band's final album ''[[You Boyz Make Big Noize]]'', although this album had a slightly grittier hard rock sound.<ref name="perseverancesite.co.uk"/>

[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] bassist [[Gene Simmons]] stated that his band's early songwriting ethos and stage performance was influenced by Slade. In his book ''Kiss and Make-Up'', Simmons wrote "... we liked the way they (Slade) connected with the crowd and the way they wrote anthems... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity".<ref>{{cite book |first1=Gene |last1=Simmons |title=Kiss and Make-up|year=2002|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=0-609-81002-2|page=85 }}</ref> [[Tom Petersson]] of [[Cheap Trick]] said that his band went to see Slade perform, and that they (Slade) used "every cheap trick in the book", thus inadvertently coining his group's name. Cheap Trick [[cover version|covered]] the song "[[When the Lights Are Out]]" on their 2009 release, ''[[The Latest]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogcritics.org/music/article/music-review-cheap-trick-the-latest1/ |title=Music Review: Cheap Trick – The Latest – Blogcritics Music |website=Blogcritics.org |access-date=5 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028195802/http://blogcritics.org/music/article/music-review-cheap-trick-the-latest1/ |archive-date=28 October 2011 }}</ref>
Quiet Riot had US hits with covers of "Cum on Feel the Noize" and "[[Mama Weer All Crazee Now]]". The origins of Slade's influence on Quiet Riot date back to the early 1970s, when [[Kevin DuBrow]] photographed Slade during their first Los Angeles appearance at the [[Whisky a Go Go]]. However, Quiet Riot drummer [[Frankie Banali]] claims that DuBrow was not a fan of Slade, favouring fellow British rock bands Queen and [[Humble Pie]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/frankie_banali_of_quiet_riot/|title=Frankie Banali of Quiet Riot : Songwriter Interviews|website=Songfacts.com|language=en|access-date=3 June 2018}}</ref>
