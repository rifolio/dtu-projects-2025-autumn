'''The Doors''' were<!-- Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both American English and British English. Please do not change "were" to "was". --> an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, comprising vocalist [[Jim Morrison]], keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]], guitarist [[Robby Krieger]], and drummer [[John Densmore]]. They were among the most influential and controversial rock acts of the 1960s, primarily due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona and legal issues. The group is widely regarded as an important figure of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|era's counterculture]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Weil |first=Martin |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-20/entertainment/39395480_1_jim-morrison-the-doors-drummer-john-densmore |title=Ray Manzarek, Keyboardist and Founding Member of the Doors, Dies at 74 |date=May 20, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=December 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216143023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/ray-manzarek-keyboardist-and-founding-member-of-the-doors-dies-at-74/2013/05/20/8ebd6b56-c197-11e2-bfdb-3886a561c1ff_story.html |archive-date=December 16, 2013}}</ref>

The band took its name from the title of the English writer [[Aldous Huxley]]'s book ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', itself a reference to a quote by the English poet [[William Blake]].

In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger, and [[Ian Astbury]] of [[the Cult]] on vocals started performing as "The Doors of the 21st Century". Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band's name. After a short time as Riders on the Storm, they settled on the name [[Manzarek–Krieger]] and toured until Manzarek's death in 2013.

== History ==
=== Origins (July 1965 – August 1966) ===
[[File:The Doors Logo.png|right|thumb|The Doors logo, designed by an [[Elektra Records]] assistant, first appeared on their 1967 debut album.]]
The Doors began with a chance meeting between acquaintances [[Jim Morrison]] and [[Ray Manzarek]] on [[Venice,_Los_Angeles#Venice_Beach|Venice Beach]] in July 1965. They recognized each other as they had both attended the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. Morrison confided in Manzarek that he had been writing songs.{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=94}} As Morrison would later relate to [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]] in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "Those first five or six songs I wrote, I was just taking notes at a fantastic rock concert that was going on inside my head. And once I'd written the songs, I had to sing them."{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=75}} With Manzarek's encouragement, Morrison sang the opening words of "[[Moonlight Drive]]": "Let's swim to the moon, let's climb through the tide, penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide." Manzarek was inspired, thinking of the music he could play to accompany these "cool and spooky" lyrics.<ref name=NPRRay>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Brent|title=NPR interview with Ray Manzarek|website=NPR.org |date=May 24, 2013 |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/05/24/185827139/remembering-ray-manzarek-keyboardist-for-the-doors|publisher=[[NPR]] – Publicly accessed|access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref>

Manzarek was then in an unsuccessful band called [[Rick & the Ravens]] with his brothers Rick and Jim, while drummer [[John Densmore]] was playing with the Psychedelic Rangers and knew Manzarek from meditation classes.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 43}} Densmore joined the group later in August 1965. Together, they combined varied musical backgrounds, from [[jazz]], rock, [[blues]], and [[folk music]] idioms.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jon |last1=Pareles |first2=Mickey |last2=Vallee |chapter=The Doors |title=The Grove Dictionary of American Music |title-link=The Grove Dictionary of American Music |publisher=[[Oxford Music Online]] |edition=2nd |date=July 10, 2012}}</ref> The five, along with bass player Patty Sullivan,{{refn|group=nb|Patty Sullivan was later credited using her married name Patricia Hansen in the Doors' 1997 [[The Doors: Box Set#Disc 1: Without a Safety Net|''Box Set'' CD release]].{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=88}}<ref name="liner" />}} and now christened the Doors, recorded a six-song demo on September 2, 1965, at World Pacific Studios in Los Angeles.{{refn|group=nb|These recordings were officially available much later in October 1997, on the Doors' ''Box Set'' CD release.

From February to May 1966, the group had a residency at the "rundown" and "sleazy" Los Angeles club [[London Fog (nightclub)|London Fog]], appearing on the bill with "Rhonda Lane Exotic Dancer".{{sfn|Weidman|2011|pp=120–121}} The experience gave Morrison confidence to perform in front of a live audience, and the band as a whole to develop and, in some cases, lengthen their songs and work "[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]" and "[[Light My Fire]]" into the pieces that would appear on their [[The Doors (album)|debut album]].{{sfn|Weidman|2011|pp=120–121}} Manzarek later said that at the London Fog the band "became this collective entity, this unit of oneness&nbsp;... that is where the magic began to happen."{{sfn|Weidman|2011|pp=120–121}} The group soon graduated to the more esteemed [[Whisky a Go Go]] after being booked by Ronnie Haran,<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Grow |first=Kory |date=2016-12-16 |title=The Doors Reflect on Earliest Concerts, Jim Morrison's Genius |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/the-doors-reflect-on-earliest-concerts-jim-morrisons-genius-121497/ |access-date=2024-04-30 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> where they were the house band (starting from May 1966), supporting acts, including [[Van Morrison]]'s group [[Them (band)|Them]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/NiteCity/DarkSideOfLA001.html |last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |title=Nite City: The Dark Side of L.A. |date=September 1977 |magazine=[[Creem]] |access-date=March 18, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709054645/http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/NiteCity/DarkSideOfLA001.html |archive-date=July 9, 2008}}</ref> On their last night together the two bands joined up for "[[In the Midnight Hour]]" and a twenty-minute jam session of "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]".{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=128}}{{sfn|Gaar|2015|p=26}}

On August 10, 1966, they were spotted by [[Elektra Records]] president [[Jac Holzman]], who was present at the recommendation of [[Love (band)|Love]] singer [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]], whose group was with Elektra Records. After Holzman and producer [[Paul A. Rothchild]] saw two sets of the band playing at the Whisky a Go Go, they signed them to the Elektra Records label on August 18&nbsp;— the start of a long and successful partnership with Rothchild and sound engineer [[Bruce Botnick]]. The Doors were fired from the Whisky on August 21, 1966, when Morrison added an explicit retelling and profanity-laden version of the [[Greek myth]] of [[Oedipus]] during "The End".{{sfn|Cherry|2013|p=13}}

=== ''The Doors'' and ''Strange Days'' (August 1966 – December 1967) ===
[[File:Doors007 c.png|thumb|The Doors performing at [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival]] in 1967]]
The Doors recorded their self-titled debut album around August 1966, at [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound Studios]].{{sfn|Goldsmith|2019|p=92}} The record was officially released in the first week of January 1967. It included the nearly 12-minute musical drama "The End".{{sfn|Moskowitz|2015|p=221}}  In November 1966, [[Mark Abramson]] directed a promotional film for the lead single "[[Break On Through (To the Other Side)]]". The group also made several television appearances, such as on ''Shebang'', a Los Angeles television show, miming to a playback of "Break On Through".{{refn|group=nb| According to ''The Doors FAQ'' author Richie Weidman, this was either New Year's Day 1967,{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=251}} or March 6, 1967, as noted by Gillian G. Gaar.{{sfn|Gaar|2015|p=41}}}} In early 1967, the group appeared on ''[[The Clay Cole Show]]'' (which aired on Saturday evenings at 6&nbsp;p.m. on WPIX Channel 11 out of New York City) where they performed their single "Break On Through". Since the single acquired only minor recognition, the band turned to "Light My Fire"; it became the first single from Elektra Records to reach number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] singles chart, selling over one million copies.<ref name="Brodsky">{{cite magazine |last=Brodsky |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Brodsky |title=Psychotic Reaction |magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |date=February 2004}}</ref>

From March 7 to 11, 1967, the Doors performed at the [[The Matrix (club)|Matrix Club]] in San Francisco. The March 7 and 10 shows were recorded by Peter Abram, co-owner of the Matrix. These recordings are notable as they are among the earliest live recordings of the band to circulate. On November 18, 2008, the Doors published a compilation of these recordings, ''[[Live at the Matrix 1967]]'', on the band's boutique Bright Midnight Archives label.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=December 19, 2008 |title=Film & Music: Rock & Pop: The CDs We Missed: The Doors: Live at the Matrix 1967: 4 Stars: (Rhino) |magazine=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Selvin |first=Joel |date=November 17, 2018 |title=City's Psychedelic Past Back In View In Doors' Matrix Discs |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref>

On August 25, 1967, they appeared on American television, guest-starring on the variety TV series ''[[Malibu U]]'', performing "Light My Fire", though they did not appear live.

On September 17, 1967, the Doors gave a memorable performance of "Light My Fire" on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.<ref name="Ed Sullivan" /> According to Manzarek, network executives asked that the word "higher" be removed, due to a possible reference to drug use.{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=253}} The group appeared to acquiesce, but performed the song in its original form, because either they had never intended to comply with the request or Jim Morrison was nervous and forgot to make the change (the group has given conflicting accounts).{{sfn|Gaar|2015|p=43}}<ref>{{cite news |first=Sterling |last=Whitaker |date=September 17, 2015 |title=When the Doors Got Banned from ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-doors-banned-from-the-ed-sullivan-show-september-17-1967/ |website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |access-date=December 3, 2021}}</ref> Either way, "higher" was sung out on national television, and the show's host, [[Ed Sullivan]], canceled another six shows that had been planned.

On December 24, the Doors performed "Light My Fire" and "Moonlight Drive" live for ''[[The Jonathan Winters Show]]''. Their performance was taped for later broadcast. From December 26 to 28, the group played at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco; during one set, in the middle of "[[Back Door Man]]", the band stopped performing to watch themselves on ''The Jonathan Winters Show'' on a television set wheeled onto the stage.{{sfn|Davis|2005|pp=219–220}}{{sfn|Gaar|2015|p=51}}

The Doors spent several weeks in Sunset Studios in Los Angeles recording their second album, ''[[Strange Days (The Doors album)|Strange Days]]'', experimenting with the new technology, notably the [[Moog synthesizer]] they now had available.{{sfn|Davis|2005|pp=197–198}} The commercial success of ''Strange Days'' was middling, peaking at number three on the ''Billboard'' album chart but quickly dropping, along with a series of underperforming singles.<ref name="Brodsky" /> The chorus from the album's single "[[People Are Strange]]" inspired the name of the 2009 documentary of the Doors, ''[[When You're Strange]]''.<ref name="Documentary"/>

Although session musician [[Larry Knechtel]] had occasionally contributed bass on the band's debut album,{{sfn|Fong-Torres|The Doors|2006|p=71}} ''Strange Days'' was the first Doors album recorded with a studio musician, playing bass on the majority of the record, and this continued on all subsequent studio albums.{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=258}} Manzarek explained that his keyboard bass was well-suited for live situations but that it lacked the "articulation" needed for studio recording.{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=258}} [[Douglas Lubahn]] played on ''Strange Days'' and the next two albums; but the band used several other musicians for this role, often using more than one bassist on the same album.

On December 9, 1967, the Doors performed a now-infamous concert at [[New Haven Arena]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], which ended abruptly when Morrison was arrested by local police.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/12/11/archives/new-haven-police-close-the-doors-use-of-mace-reported.html?sq=Jim+Morrison+New+Haven&scp=2&st=p |title=New Haven Police Close 'The Doors'; Use of Mace Reported |date=December 10, 1967 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=November 21, 2010}}</ref> Morrison became the first rock artist to be arrested onstage during a live performance.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=20}}{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=216}} Prior to the start of the concert, Morrison was either having a private conversation with{{sfn|Gaar|2015|pp=48–49}} or kissing a female fan backstage in a bathroom shower stall when a police officer happened upon them.{{sfn|Krieger|2021|pp=27–28}} Unaware that he was the lead singer of the band, the officer told Morrison and the fan to leave, to which Morrison said, "Eat it."

The Doors' main act was delayed for an hour while Morrison recovered, after which the band took the stage very late. According to music journalist Gillian G. Gaar, the police still did not consider the issue resolved and wanted to charge him. Halfway through the first set, Morrison proceeded to create an improvised song about his experience with the "little man in blue".{{sfn|Gaar|2015|pp=48–49}} It was an obscenity-laced account to the audience, describing what had happened backstage and taunting the police, who were surrounding the stage.{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=266}}<ref>{{cite web |first=Sterling |last=Whitaker |date=December 9, 2015 |title=Why Jim Morrison Got Arrested Onstage in New Haven |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jim-morrison-maced-and-arrested-in-new-haven/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=November 20, 2021}}</ref> Later, the police lieutenant approached Morrison, during which Morrison thrust the microphone against his mouth and remarked, "Say your thing, man."{{sfn|Krieger|2021|pp=27–28}}{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=266}} The concert came to an abrupt end when Morrison was dragged from the stage by the police. The audience, already restless from waiting so long for the band to perform, became unruly. Morrison was taken to a local police station, photographed and booked on charges of inciting a riot, indecency and public obscenity. Charges against Morrison, as well as those against three journalists also arrested in the incident ([[Mike Zwerin]], Yvonne Chabrier and [[Tim Page (photographer)|Tim Page]]), were dropped several weeks later for lack of evidence.{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=216}}{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=272}}

=== ''Waiting for the Sun'' (April–December 1968) ===
[[File:The Doors Cobo Arena Detroit 1968.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Poster for a 1968 concert at the [[Cobo Arena]], Detroit]]
Recording of the group's third album in April 1968 was marred by tension as a result of Morrison's increasing dependence on alcohol and the rejection of the 17-minute "[[Celebration of the Lizard]]" by band producer Paul Rothchild, who considered the work not commercial enough.{{sfn|Wall|2014|p=197}} Approaching the height of their popularity, the Doors played a series of outdoor shows that led to frenzied scenes between fans and police, particularly at [[Chicago Coliseum]] on May 10.{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=268}}

The band began to branch out from their initial form for this third LP, and began writing new material. ''[[Waiting for the Sun]]'' became their first and only album to reach number 1 on the US charts, and the single "[[Hello, I Love You]]" (one of the six songs performed by the band on their 1965 Aura Records demo) was their second US No. 1 single. Following the 1968 release of "Hello, I Love You", the publisher of [[the Kinks]]' 1964 hit "[[All Day and All of the Night]]" announced they were planning legal action against the Doors for copyright infringement; however, songwriter [[Ray Davies]] ultimately chose not to sue.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=119–120}}{{refn|group=nb|However, some have supported that the court in the United Kingdom determined in favor of Davies and any royalties for the song are paid to him.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/11/the-kinks-ray-davies-brexit-is-bigger-than-the-berlin-wall |title=The Kinks' Ray Davies: Brexit is 'Bigger Than the Berlin Wall' |first=Adrian |last=Deevoy |magazine=The Guardian |date=May 11, 2017 |access-date=September 3, 2020}}</ref>}} Kinks guitarist [[Dave Davies]] was particularly irritated by the similarity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kinks.it.rit.edu/misc/articles/latimes.html |title=Loyal Pains: The Davies Boys Are Still at It |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907003915/http://kinks.it.rit.edu/misc/articles/latimes.html |archive-date=September 7, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2006}}</ref> In concert, Morrison was occasionally dismissive of the song, leaving the vocals to Manzarek, as can be seen in the documentary ''[[The Doors Are Open]]''.<ref name="hellomanzarek">{{Cite AV media |title=The Doors Are Open |title-link=The Doors Are Open |date=1968 |people=The Doors |place=The Roadhouse, London |medium=Concert/Documentary}}</ref>

A month after a riotous concert at the [[Singer Bowl]] in New York City, the group flew to Great Britain for their first performance outside North America. They held a press conference at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA Gallery]] in London and played shows at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]]. The results of the trip were broadcast on [[Granada TV]]'s ''The Doors Are Open'', later released on video. They played dates in Europe, along with [[Jefferson Airplane]], including a show in Amsterdam where Morrison collapsed on stage after a drug binge (including marijuana, hashish and unspecified pills).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jim-morrison-passes-out-amsterdam/ |title=When Ray Manzarek Had to Fill in for a Passed-Out Jim Morrison |last=Gallucci |first=Michael |date=September 15, 2015 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=October 3, 2020}}</ref>

The group flew back to the United States and played nine more dates before returning to work in November on their fourth LP. They ended the year with a successful new single, "[[Touch Me (The Doors song)|Touch Me]]" (released in December 1968), which reached No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 1 in the [[Cashbox Top 100 number-one singles of 1969|''Cashbox'' Top 100]] in early 1969; this was the group's third and last American number-one single.<ref>{{cite web |title=Once Upon a Time in the Top Spot: The Doors, 'Touch Me' |date=February 12, 2019 |url=https://www.rhino.com/article/once-upon-a-time-in-the-top-spot-the-doors-touch-me |website=[[Rhino Records|Rhino.com]] |access-date=April 11, 2021}}</ref>

=== Miami incident (March 1969) ===
{{anchor|Miami incident}}
[[File:Jim Morrison mug shot.jpg|right|thumb|Jim Morrison on the day of his conviction in Miami for profanity and indecent exposure]]
On March 1, 1969, at the [[Coconut Grove Convention Center|Dinner Key Auditorium]] in the [[Coconut Grove]] neighborhood of Miami, Florida, the Doors gave the most controversial and consequential performance of their career, one that nearly "derailed the band".<ref name="allmusic.com" /> The auditorium was a converted seaplane hangar that had no air conditioning on that hot night, and the seats had been removed by the promoter to boost ticket sales.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=227}}{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=293}}

Morrison had been drinking all day and had missed connecting flights to Miami. By the time he arrived, drunk, the concert was over an hour late.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=227}}{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=312}} The restless crowd of {{formatnum:12000}}, packed into a facility designed to hold {{formatnum:7000}}, was subjected to undue silences in Morrison's singing, which strained the music from the beginning of the performance. Morrison had recently attended a play by an experimental acting company [[the Living Theatre]] and was inspired by their "antagonistic" style of performance art.{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=310}}{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|pp=292–293, 295}} Morrison taunted the crowd with messages of both love and hate, saying, "Love me. I can't take it no more without no good love. I want some lovin'. Ain't nobody gonna love my ass?" and alternately, "You're all a bunch of fuckin' idiots!" and "You’re all a bunch of slaves!"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/1991/02/28/jim-morrisons-miami-show/ |title=Jim Morrison's Miami 'Show' |date= 28 February 1991|newspaper=[[South Florida Sun Sentinel]]}}</ref> while screaming "What are you gonna do about it?" over and over again.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|pp=292–293, 295}}{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=230}}{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=312}}

As the band began their second song, "Touch Me", Morrison started shouting in protest, forcing the band to a halt. At one point, Morrison removed the hat of an onstage police officer and threw it into the crowd; the officer reacted by taking Morrison's hat and throwing it in the same direction.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=296}}{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=231}} Manager [[Bill Siddons]] recalled, "The gig was a bizarre, circus-like thing, there was this guy carrying a sheep and the wildest people that I'd ever seen."{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=297}} Equipment chief Vince Treanor said, "Somebody jumped up and poured champagne on Jim so he took his shirt off, he was soaking wet. 'Let's see a little skin, let's get naked,' he said, and the audience started taking their clothes off."{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=297}}  Having removed his shirt, Morrison held it in front of his groin area and started to make hand movements behind it.<ref name="mojo">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01278z4 |title=BBC Radio 2 – Mr Mojo Risin' |website=[[BBC]] |date=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Manzarek described the incident as a mass "religious hallucination".<ref name="mojo" />

On March 5, the Dade County Sheriff's office issued a warrant for Morrison's arrest, claiming Morrison had exposed his penis while on stage, shouted obscenities to the crowd, simulated [[oral sex]] on Krieger, and was drunk at the time of his performance. Morrison turned down a plea bargain that required the Doors to perform a free Miami concert. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail with hard labor, and ordered to pay a $500 fine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/jim-morrison-is-charged-with-lewd-behavior-at-a-miami-concert |title=Mar 5, 1969: Jim Morrison is charged with lewd behavior at a Miami concert |website=[[History Channel|History.com]] |date=November 13, 2009 |access-date=August 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doors.com/miami/letter.html |title=2007 Letter to Governor Crist |website=Doors.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927100410/http://www.doors.com/miami/letter.html |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |access-date=August 20, 2011}}</ref> Morrison remained free, pending an appeal of his conviction, and died before the matter was legally resolved.

=== ''The Soft Parade'' (May–July 1969) ===
Morrison, who was increasingly distancing himself from the music, announced to the other Doors members his intention to quit the group; Manzarek convinced him to stay for six more months, ahead of completing ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', the Doors' forthcoming album.{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=181}}{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=190}}

Released in July 1969, ''The Soft Parade'' was their first-and-only to feature [[brass instrument|brass]] and [[string instrument|string]] arrangements. The concept was suggested by Rothchild to the band, after listening to many examples by various groups who also explored the same radical departure.<ref name="Jackson" /> Both jazz-influenced Densmore and Manzarek agreed with the recommendation,{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=320}} but Morrison declined to incorporate orchestral accompaniment on his compositions.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|pp=338–340}} The lead single, "Touch Me", featured saxophonist [[Curtis Amy]].{{sfn|Goldsmith|2019|p=94}}
[[File:The Doors 1969.JPG|thumb|The Doors {{circa|1968}}]]

While the band was trying faintly to maintain their previous momentum, efforts to expand their sound with instrumental changes, including string, brass, and wind parts, caused critics to attack their musical integrity.{{sfn|Matijas-Mecca|2020|p=80}} According to Densmore in his biography ''Riders on the Storm'', individual writing credits were noted for the first time because of Morrison's reluctance to sing the lyrics of Krieger's song "[[Tell All the People]]". Morrison's drinking made him difficult and unreliable, and the recording sessions dragged on for months. Studio costs piled up, and the Doors came close to disintegrating. Despite all this, the album was immensely successful, becoming the band's fourth hit album.{{sfn|Densmore|1990|p=187}}

=== ''Morrison Hotel'' and ''Absolutely Live'' (November 1969 – December 1970) ===
[[File:Doors - Morrison Hotel.jpg|left|thumb|Photo by [[Henry Diltz]] used on the cover of ''[[Morrison Hotel]]'']]
During the recording of their next album, ''[[Morrison Hotel]]'', in November 1969, Morrison again found himself in trouble with the law after harassing airline staff during a flight to Phoenix, Arizona to see [[the Rolling Stones]] in concert. Both Morrison and his friend and traveling companion [[Tom Baker (American actor)|Tom Baker]] were charged with "interfering with the flight of an intercontinental aircraft and public drunkenness".{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=347}} If convicted of the most serious charge, Morrison could have faced a ten-year federal prison sentence for the incident.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=284}} The charges were dropped in April 1970 after an airline stewardess reversed her testimony to say she mistakenly identified Morrison as Baker.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=290}}

The Doors staged a return to a more conventional direction after the experimental ''The Soft Parade'', with their fifth LP ''Morrison Hotel'' in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |first=Harvey |last=Kubernik |author-link=Harvey Kubernik |title=Ray Manzarek on the Doors' 6 Studio Albums: The 'Lost' Interviews |url=https://bestclassicbands.com/ray-manzarek-interview-doors-12-18-19/
|work=Best Classic Bands |date=February 12, 2022 |access-date=June 14, 2022}}</ref> Featuring a consistent [[blues rock]] sound, the album's opener was "[[Roadhouse Blues]]". The record reached No. 4 in the United States and revived their status among their core fanbase and the rock press. [[Dave Marsh]], the editor of ''[[Creem]]'' magazine, said of the album: "the most horrifying rock and roll I have ever heard. When they're good, they're simply unbeatable. I know this is the best record I've listened to&nbsp; ... so far".{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=284}} ''[[Rock (magazine)|Rock Magazine]]'' called it "without any doubt their ballsiest (and best) album to date".{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=284}} ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' magazine praised it as "possibly the best album yet from the Doors" and "good hard, evil rock, and one of the best albums released this decade".{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=284}} The album also saw Morrison returning as main songwriter, writing or co-writing all of the album's tracks. The 40th anniversary CD reissue of ''Morrison Hotel'' contains outtakes and alternative takes, including different versions of "The Spy" and "Roadhouse Blues" (with [[Lonnie Mack]] on bass guitar and [[the Lovin' Spoonful]]'s [[John Sebastian]] on harmonica).<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Morrison Hotel |title-link=Morrison Hotel |others=The Doors |type=40th Anniversary edition CD booklet & Liner notes |year=2007 |publisher=[[Rhino Records]] |last1=Botnick |first1=Bruce |author-link1=Bruce Botnick |last2=Fricke |first2=David |author-link2=David Fricke |id=R2 101173}}</ref>

July 1970 saw the release of the group's first live album, ''[[Absolutely Live (The Doors album)|Absolutely Live]]'', which peaked at No. 8 position on the charts.{{sfn|Gaar|2015|p=102}} The record was completed by producer Rothchild, who confirmed that the album's final mixing consisted of many bits and pieces from various and different band concerts. "There must be 2000 edits on that album", he told an interviewer years later.<ref name="Jackson" /> ''Absolutely Live'' also includes the first release of the lengthy piece "Celebration of the Lizard".

Although the Doors continued to face de facto bans in more conservative American markets and earned new bans at [[Salt Lake City]]'s [[Salt Palace (arena)|Salt Palace]] and Detroit's Cobo Hall following tumultuous concerts,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-doors-cobo-arena-1970/ |title=How the Doors Got Banned from Detroit's Cobo Arena |last=Lifton |first=Dave |date=May 9, 2015 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mildequator.com/performancehistory/concertinfo/cancelled/700411.html |title=The Doors Cancelled Performances {{!}} Salt Lake City 1970 |website=Mildequator.com |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> the band managed to play 18 concerts in the United States, Mexico and Canada following the Miami incident in 1969,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mildequator.com/performancehistory/concertdates1969.html |title=The Doors Concert Dates & Info 1969 |website=Mildequator.com |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> and 23 dates in the United States and Canada throughout the first half of 1970.

On December 8, 1970, his 27th birthday, Morrison recorded another poetry session.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=An American Prayer |title-link=An American Prayer |type=CD booklet |year=1995 |publisher=Elektra Records |last=Lisciandro |first=Katherine |id=CD-61812}}</ref> Part of this would end up on ''[[An American Prayer]]'' in 1978 with music, and is currently in the possession of the Courson family.{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=375}} Shortly thereafter, a new tour to promote their upcoming album would comprise only three dates. Two concerts were held in Dallas on December 11. During the Doors' last public performance with Morrison, at [[The Warehouse (New Orleans)|The Warehouse]] in New Orleans, on December 12, 1970, Morrison apparently had a breakdown on stage. Midway through the set he slammed the microphone numerous times into the stage floor until the platform beneath was destroyed, then sat down and refused to perform for the remainder of the show.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|pp=438–439}} After the concert, Densmore, Manzarek and Krieger came to a mutual agreement that they should end their live act, claiming Morrison was ready to retire from performing.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=309}}{{sfn|Densmore|1990|p=263}}

[[File:Grave of Jim Morrison.JPG|thumb|Jim Morrison's grave at the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris]]
Despite Morrison's conviction and the fallout from their appearance in New Orleans, the Doors set out to reclaim their status as a premier act with the album ''[[L.A.

''L.A. Woman''{{'}}s follow up album, ''[[Other Voices (The Doors album)|Other Voices]]'', was being planned while Morrison was in Paris.

Manzarek along with Krieger, Densmore and DJ/producer [[Skrillex]] ([[Sonny Moore]]) recorded a new song in 2012, of which Manzarek said, "I like to say this is the first new Doors track of the 21st century".

== Musical style and influences ==
The Doors initially started as a conventional [[electric blues]] band, but subsequently enriched their sound with [[jazz]], [[psychedelic rock]],  [[raga]], [[classical music|classical]] references, [[funk]] and [[flamenco]].{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=11}} In live performances, they experimented with [[free improvisation]] based on [[dodecaphony|dodecaphonic]], cacophonic passages and [[delay (audio effect)|delay]]/[[echo]] effects,{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=317}} in order to accompany [[spoken word|spoken-word poetry]] sessions or to fill long instrumental [[jam sessions|jams]].{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=318}} In the second album the group incorporated elements of [[electronic music]] and [[musique concrète]]{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=11}} and introduced unusual instruments such as the [[Moog synthesizer]], the [[harpsichord]] and the [[marimba]].{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=421}} The band's fourth album, ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', is also notable because it featured brass, wind and string instrumentation, touching upon [[big band]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] styles.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=11}}  

Music journalist and critic [[David Fricke]] observed that they were "the first american rock ensemble to regularly blend [[reverb]], echos, [[fuzz (electric guitar)|fuzz]] and other innovative sound effects with keyboards and organ, both on studio works and live shows. A pioneering approach to improvisation in psychedelic music that established some of its most defining characteristics. A lot of keyboard-based groups of the era should thank them",{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=12}} and praised their efficiency during concerts to "alternate to intense, essential blues numbers [[jazz-rock]] instrumentals led by exceptionally dynamic drumming, masterfully calculated guitar insertions and challenging, explorative organ chords: giant rooms where an unlimited set of vocal improvisations has all the space to be delivered".{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=14}}

Manzarek cited a range of influences that include [[boogie-woogie]], [[Chicago blues]], the jazzers [[John Coltrane]], [[Miles Davis]] and [[Bill Evans]],{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=318}} and classical composers such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=421}} Krieger was heavily affected by his study of the [[sitar]] and the structures of indian classical music.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=2011}} He said Coltrane was "my biggest music influence".{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=311}} He was familiar with [[modal music|modal]] scales and the traditional spanish flamenco,{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=421}} incorporating them all in his guitar style to create an original trademark of versatility that distinguished him from the other rock guitarists of the period.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=11}} Densmore was shaped by [[Elvin Jones]], the drummer of John Coltrane's quartet,{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=311}} and by the stylistic features of Latin American percussions, especially the [[bossa nova]] rhythms of saxophonist [[Stan Getz]].{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=318}}

== Legacy ==
The band presaged [[gothic rock]] due to the violence and the darkness present in their early work. As soon as 1967, critic John Stickney announced in the title of his article: "Four Doors to the Future: Gothic Rock Is Their Thing".<ref name=Stickney>{{cite news|last=Stickney |first=John |date=October 24, 1967 |title=Four Doors to the Future: Gothic Rock Is Their Thing |newspaper=[[The Williams Record]] |url=http://mildequator.com/performancehistory/articlesreviews1967.html |access-date=March 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504231130/http://mildequator.com/performancehistory/articlesreviews1967.html |archive-date=May 4, 2013}}</ref> Journalist [[Dave Marsh]] would also qualify a few years later the "first couple of Doors albums" as a prime example of "gothic rock".<ref>{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Marsh|author-link=Dave Marsh|title=Record Reviews - Philip Glass ''North Star''|newspaper=[[The Morning Record and Journal]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfxcAAAAIBAJ&dq=gothic+rock+1977&pg=PA46&article_id=5826,2669496 |date=April 16, 1977 |page=46 |access-date=August 12, 2023}}</ref> Academics [[Paul Hegarty (musician)|Paul Hegarty]] and Martin Halliwell argued that the Doors were [[proto-prog|precursors]] of [[progressive rock|prog]] and reflected important developments in progressive music.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=11}} 

Beginning in the late 1970s, there was a sustained revival of interest in the Doors which created a new generation of fans.{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=418}} The origin of the revival is traced to the release of the album ''An American Prayer'' in late 1978 which contained a live version of "[[Roadhouse Blues]]" that received considerable airplay on [[album-oriented rock]] radio stations. In 1979, the song "[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]" was featured in dramatic fashion in the film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'',<ref name="allmusic.com" />{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=421}} and the next year, the bestselling biography of Morrison ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]'' was published. The Doors' first album, ''The Doors'', re-entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart in September 1980 and Elektra Records reported the Doors' albums were selling better than in any year since their original release.<ref name="Breslin">{{Cite magazine |last=Breslin |first=Rosemary |date=September 19, 1981 |title=Jim Morrison: He's Hot, He's Sexy and He's Dead |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jim-morrison-hes-hot-hes-sexy-and-hes-dead-113162/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |location=New York City |access-date=January 27, 2020}}</ref> In response a new compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits (The Doors album)|Greatest Hits]]'', was released in October 1980.

The revival continued in 1983 with ''[[Alive, She Cried]]'', an album of previously unreleased live recordings. The track "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]" reached No. 18 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Top Tracks]] chart<ref>{{Cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |title=Rock Tracks |date=2002 |publisher=Record Research Inc. |isbn=0-89820-153-5 |location=Menomonee Falls |page=49}}</ref> and the video was in [[Rotation (music)|heavy rotation]] on [[MTV]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=January 7, 1984 |title=Video Music Programming |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |location=New York}}</ref> Another compilation album, ''[[The Best of the Doors (1985 album)|The Best of the Doors]]'' was released in 1985 and went on to be certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] in 2007 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of 10 million certified units.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/pro/the-doors-a-billboard-chart-history/ |title=The Doors a ''Billboard'' Chart History |magazine=Billboard |access-date=December 15, 2021}}</ref>

A second revival, attracting another generation of fans, occurred in 1991 following the release of the film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', directed by [[Oliver Stone]] and starring [[Val Kilmer]] as Morrison.{{sfn|Luhrssen|Larson|2017|p=98}} Stone created the script from over a hundred interviews of people who were in Morrison's life.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oliver Stone and ''The Doors'' |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=March 16, 1991}}</ref> He designed the movie by picking the songs and then adding the appropriate storylines to them.{{sfn|Riordan|1996|p=311}} The remaining band members did not like the film's portrayal of the events. In the book ''The Doors'',{{sfn|Fong-Torres|The Doors|2006|pp=232–234}} Manzarek states, "That Oliver Stone thing did real damage to the guy I knew: Jim Morrison, the poet." In addition, Manzarek claims that he wanted the movie to be about all four members of the band, not only Morrison.<ref>{{cite news |last=Broeske |first=P |date=March 10, 1991 |title=Stormy Rider |newspaper=[[Sunday Herald]]}}</ref> Densmore asserts, "A third of it's fiction." In the same volume, Krieger agrees with the other two, but also says, "It could have been a lot worse." The film's [[The Doors (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' album chart and ''Greatest Hits'' and ''The Best of the Doors'' re-entered the chart, with the latter reaching a new peak position of No. 32.
