'''Three Days Grace''' is a Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Asphodel–Norwood|Norwood, Ontario]], in 1992 originally as '''Groundswell'''. Groundswell played in various local Norwood backyard parties and area establishments before disbanding in 1995 and regrouping in 1997 under its current name.

Based in [[Toronto]], the band's original line-up consisted of guitarist and lead vocalist [[Adam Gontier]], drummer and backing vocalist [[Neil Sanderson]], and bassist [[Brad Walst]]. In 2003, [[Barry Stock]] was recruited as the band's lead guitarist, making them a quartet. In 2013, Gontier left the band and was replaced by Walst's younger brother [[Matt Walst|Matt]], who was a longtime songwriter for the band and was previously the lead singer of [[My Darkest Days]]. In 2024, Gontier officially rejoined the band with Walst also remaining as a singer, making them a dual-vocalist band, as well as a quintet for the first time since their genesis as Groundswell.

Currently signed to [[RCA Records]], they have released eight studio albums: ''[[Three Days Grace (album)|Three Days Grace]]'' in 2003, ''[[One-X]]'' in 2006, ''[[Life Starts Now]]'' in 2009, ''[[Transit of Venus (album)|Transit of Venus]]'' in 2012, ''[[Human (Three Days Grace album)|Human]]'' in 2015, ''[[Outsider (Three Days Grace album)|Outsider]]'' in 2018, ''[[Explosions (Three Days Grace album)|Explosions]]'' in 2022 and ''[[Alienation (album)|Alienation]]'' in 2025. The first three albums have been [[RIAA certified]] 2× platinum, 3× platinum, and platinum, respectively, in the United States. In Canada, they have been [[Music Canada#Certification-awards|certified by Music Canada]] as platinum, triple platinum, and double platinum, respectively. In the United Kingdom, their second album ''[[One-X]]'' was certified silver by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] and gold by the [[Recorded Music NZ]].{{Certification Cite Ref|region=Canada|artist=Three Days Grace|refname="MC"|access-date=9 December 2022}}{{Certification Cite Ref|region=United States|artist=Three Days Grace|refname="RIAA"|access-date=9 December 2022}}{{Certification Cite Ref|region=United Kingdom|artist=Three Days Grace|title=One-X|type=album|refname="BPI"|id=18561-5350-2|access-date=9 December 2022}}{{Certification Cite Ref|region=New Zealand|artist=Three Days Grace|type=album|refname="RMNZalbums"|source=radioscope|access-date=27 January 2025}} The band has 19 No. 1 songs on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and had 3 No. 1 hits on the [[Alternative Songs]] chart.

They gave him several years' worth of material which they had created, and he "...picked out what he called 'the golden nuggets'", according to Gontier.<ref name=maplemusic>{{cite web |title=Three Days Grace Biography |url=http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/tdg/bio.asp |publisher=[[MapleMusic Recordings]] |access-date=August 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114171307/http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/tdg/bio.asp |archive-date=November 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Brown and the band polished the songs and created a demo album, which they gave to [[EMI Music Publishing|EMI Music Publishing Canada]].
