'''George Harrison'''{{refn|group=nb|Some published sources give Harold as Harrison's middle name;<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|2001|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Giuliano|Giuliano|1998|p=246}}</ref> however, there is no middle name on his birth certificate.}} (25 February 1943&nbsp;– 29 November 2001){{r|group=nb|"birthday"}} was an English musician who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of [[the Beatles]]. Known as "the quiet Beatle", Harrison embraced [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} 

Although most of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon–McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions, including "[[Taxman]]", "[[Within You Without You]]", "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" and "[[Here Comes the Sun]]". Harrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; subsequent influences were [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]]. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of Indian instruments, such as the [[sitar]], which he had become acquainted with on the set of the film ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]].''<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 15, 2017 |title=George Harrison's sitar to be auctioned |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-41276669 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250719083435/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-41276669 |archive-date=July 19, 2025 |access-date=August 13, 2025 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> He played sitar on numerous Beatles songs, starting with "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]". Having initiated the band's embrace of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. Harrison's first marriage to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966 ended in divorce in 1977. In the following year he married [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia Arias]], with whom he had a son, [[Dhani Harrison|Dhani]]. 

After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the Beatles disbanded]], Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, "[[My Sweet Lord]]", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974. He co-founded [[HandMade Films]] in 1978, initially to produce the [[Monty Python]] troupe's [[comedy film]] ''[[The Life of Brian]]'' (1979).

Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]], and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]], and [[Tom Petty]].

According to Boyd, Harrison's mother was particularly supportive: "All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy, and she recognised that nothing made George quite as happy as making music."{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=82}} Louise was an enthusiastic music fan, and she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=120}} When Louise was pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast ''Radio India''. Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, "Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and [[tabla]]s, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb."{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=2}}

Harrison lived at 12 Arnold Grove until 1 January 1950.<Ref>The Beatles - page 48 - Mark Lewisohn</Ref> A terraced house on a [[cul-de-sac]], it had an outdoor toilet, and its only heat came from a single coal fire.

When George Harrison was about 14, a friend of Harrison, Raymond Hughes, offered to sell a guitar.

McCartney and his friend [[John Lennon]] were in a skiffle group called [[the Quarrymen]]. In March 1958, at McCartney's urging, Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at [[Rory Storm]]'s Morgue Skiffle Club, playing [[Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith]]'s "[[Guitar Boogie (song)|Guitar Boogie Shuffle]]", but Lennon felt that Harrison, having just turned 15, was too young to join the band.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=125–126}} McCartney arranged a second meeting, on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, during which Harrison impressed Lennon by performing the lead guitar part for the instrumental "[[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=127}}.</ref> He began socialising with the group, filling in on guitar as needed,{{sfn|Davies|2009|pp=44–45}} and then became accepted as a member.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=13}} Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at [[Blacklers]], a local department store.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyd|2007|p=82}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=55}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Harrison|2002|p=29}}: (primary source).</ref> During the group's first tour of Scotland, in 1960, Harrison used the pseudonym "Carl Harrison", in reference to Carl Perkins.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=309}}

Dylan and [[the Band]] were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=52}} While on a visit to [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] in late 1968, he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, which contrasted with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the Beatles.{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=39–52}} Tensions among the group surfaced again in January 1969, at [[Twickenham Film Studios|Twickenham Studios]], during the filmed rehearsals that became the 1970 documentary ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let It Be]]''.{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=39–52}} Frustrated by the cold and sterile film studio, by Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles, and by what he perceived as a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison quit the group on 10 January. He returned 12 days later, after his bandmates had agreed to move the film project to their own [[Apple Studios (recording studio)|Apple Studio]] and to abandon McCartney's plan for making a return to public performance.{{sfn|Doggett|2009|pp=60–63}}

Relations among the Beatles were more cordial, though still strained, when the band recorded their 1969 album ''[[Abbey Road]]''.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=354}} The LP included what Lavezzoli describes as "two classic contributions" from Harrison – "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" and "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" – that saw him "finally achieve equal songwriting status" with Lennon and McCartney.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=185}} During the album's recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, rejecting suggestions for changes to his music, particularly from McCartney.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=15}} "Something" became his first A-side when issued on a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double A-side]] single with "[[Come Together]]"; the song was number one in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and West Germany,{{sfn|Sullivan|2013|p=563}} and the combined sides topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the United States.{{sfn|Bronson|1992|p=262}} In the 1970s [[Frank Sinatra]] recorded "Something" twice (1970 and 1979) and later dubbed it "the greatest love song of the past fifty years".{{sfn|Fricke|2002|p=178}} Lennon considered it the best song on ''Abbey Road'', and it became the Beatles' second most covered song after "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Spignesi|Lewis|2009|p=97}}: "Something" is the Beatles' second most covered song after "Yesterday"; {{harvnb|Gilmore|2002|p=39}}: Lennon considered "Something" the best song on ''Abbey Road''.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Harrison received an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello award]] in July 1970 for "Something", as "The Best Song Musically and Lyrically of the Year".{{sfn|Badman|2001|p=12}}}}
In May 1970, Harrison's song "[[For You Blue]]" was coupled on a US single with McCartney's "[[The Long and Winding Road]]" and became Harrison's second chart-topper when the sides were listed together at number one on the Hot 100.{{sfn|Bronson|1992|p=275}} His increased productivity meant that by the time of [[Break-up of the Beatles|their break-up]] he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=36–37}} While Harrison grew as a songwriter, his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing his frustration, and significantly contributing to the band's break-up.{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=413}} Harrison's last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he, McCartney and Starr recorded overdubs to the song "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]" for the [[Let It Be (album)|soundtrack album of the same name]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=195}}

[[File:Wonderwall by George Harrison.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Trade ad for ''Wonderwall Music'']]
Before the Beatles' break-up, Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums: ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' and ''[[Electronic Sound]]'', both of which contain mainly instrumental compositions.

For many years, Harrison was restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles' albums, but he released ''All Things Must Pass'', a [[Double album#Triple album|triple album]]{{sfn|Schaffner|1980|p=155}} with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison [[Jam session|jamming]] with friends.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=508}} The album was regarded by many as his best work, and it topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=181}}{{sfn|Inglis|2010|pp=xv, 23}}{{refn|group=nb|In July 2006, it was determined that ''All Things Must Pass'' should have been credited as a number one album in the United Kingdom when first released in 1970–71.

In 2000, Apple Records released a thirtieth-anniversary edition of the album, and Harrison actively participated in its promotion. In an interview, he reflected on the work: "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion."{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=16}} He commented on the production: "Well, in those days it was like the [[Reverb effect|reverb]] was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now.

Harrison responded to a request from Ravi Shankar by organising a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971. The event drew over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="ConcertforBangladesh">{{cite web|url=http://www.concertforbangladesh.com/|title=Concert for Bangladesh|publisher=Concert For Bangladesh|access-date=1 January 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116114838/http://www.concertforbangladesh.com/|archive-date=16 November 2012}}</ref> The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=132–136}} Shankar opened the show, which featured popular musicians such as Dylan, Clapton, [[Leon Russell]], Badfinger, Preston and Starr.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=132–136}}

Harrison's 1973 album ''[[Living in the Material World]]'' held the number one spot on the ''Billboard'' albums chart for five weeks, and the album's single, "[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)]]", also reached number one in the US.<ref>{{harvnb|Bronson|1992|p=336}}: Peak US chart position for "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)"; {{harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=162}}: US chart data on ''Living in the Material World''.</ref> In the UK, the LP peaked at number two and the single reached number 8.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=227}} The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=158–159}} In Greene's opinion it "contained many of the strongest compositions of his career".{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=194}} [[Stephen Holden]], writing in ''Rolling Stone'', felt the album was "vastly appealing" and "profoundly seductive", and that it stood "alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=195}} Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=43}}

In November 1974, Harrison became the first ex-Beatle to tour North America when he began his 45-date [[George Harrison and Ravi Shankar's 1974 North American tour|Dark Horse Tour]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=166, 195}} The shows included guest spots by his band members Billy Preston and [[Tom Scott (saxophonist)|Tom Scott]], and traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by "Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends".<ref>{{harvnb|Inglis|2010|pp=48–49}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=167}}.</ref> Despite numerous positive reviews, the consensus reaction to the tour was negative.<ref>{{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=224–228}}; {{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=213}}; {{harvnb|Huntley|2006|p=115}}; {{harvnb|Inglis|2010|p=49}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=162}}: "an excellent show"; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|pp=114–115}}.</ref> Some fans found Shankar's significant presence to be a bizarre disappointment, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison's "sermonizing".{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=49}} Further, he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs,{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=49}} and his [[laryngitis]]-affected vocals led to some critics calling the tour "dark hoarse".<ref>{{harvnb|Greene|2006|pp=213–214}}; {{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=224–226}}.</ref> The author Robert Rodriguez commented: "While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted.

On 16 November 1974, Harrison and several others involved in the tour visited the White House.

In December, Harrison released ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'', which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career.{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=213}} ''Rolling Stone'' called it "the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new 'LP product', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks".{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=114}} The album reached number 4 on the ''Billboard'' chart and the single "[[Dark Horse (George Harrison song)|Dark Horse]]" reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK.<ref>{{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=213}}: failed to reach the UK top 30; {{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=142–143}}: Peak US chart positions, failure to impact UK charts.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|In December 1974 the single, "[[Ding Dong, Ding Dong]]", reached number 38 in the UK.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=227}}}} The music critic [[Mikal Gilmore]] described ''Dark Horse'' as "one of Harrison's most fascinating works – a record about change and loss".{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|p=46}}

''[[Thirty Three & 1/3]]'' (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles "[[This Song]]" and "[[Crackerbox Palace]]", both of which reached the top 25 in the US.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=187}}{{refn|group=nb|Released during the same month, ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'' combined several of his Beatles songs with a selection of his solo Apple work.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=28–29}} After Harrison's departure from the label, Capitol was able to license releases featuring Beatles and post-Beatles work on the same album.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=188}}}} The [[surreal humour]] of "Crackerbox Palace" reflected Harrison's association with [[Monty Python]]'s [[Eric Idle]], who directed a comical music video for the song.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=192}} With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, ''Thirty Three & 1/3'' earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since ''All Things Must Pass''.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=192}} The album peaked just outside the top ten there, but outsold his previous two LPs.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=192, 195}}{{sfn|Woffinden|1981|pp=103–04}} As part of his promotion for the release, Harrison performed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with [[Paul Simon]].{{sfn|Glazer|1977|p=41}}

===Guitar work===
[[File:Harrison - guitare.jpg|thumb|left|Harrison's burgundy Les Paul]]
Harrison's guitar work with the Beatles was varied and flexible. Although not fast or flashy, his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s. His rhythm guitar playing was innovative, for example when he used a [[Capo (musical device)|capo]] to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965) album and "[[Here Comes the Sun]]", to create a bright, sweet sound.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag122/feature122.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010121901/http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag122/feature122.html
|title=The Unsung Beatle: George Harrison's behind-the-scenes contributions to the world's greatest band|first=David|last=Simons|date=February 2003|magazine=[[Acoustic Guitar (magazine)|Acoustic Guitar]]|page=60 |archive-date=10 October 2007|access-date=11 December 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Womack|Davis|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_8Ob1bL_ongC&pg=PA80 80]}} Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was "clearly an innovator" as he was "taking certain elements of R&B and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique".{{sfn|Harrison|2011|p=194}} ''Rolling Stone'' founder [[Jann Wenner]] described Harrison as "a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely in the service of the song".{{sfn|Harrison|2002|p=15}} The [[guitar picking]] style of [[Chet Atkins]] and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison, giving a [[country music]] feel to many of the Beatles' recordings.{{sfn|Kitts|2002|p=17}} He identified [[Chuck Berry]] as another early influence.<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=294–95}}: Perkins; {{harvnb|Harry|2000|pp=140–41}}: Berry.</ref>

In 1961, the Beatles recorded "[[Cry for a Shadow]]", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who is credited with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as [[the Shadows]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=4–5}} Harrison's liberal use of the [[diatonic scale]] in his guitar playing reveals the influence of [[Buddy Holly]], and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the [[blues scale]] while incorporating a [[rockabilly]] feel in the style of Perkins.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=13}}{{refn|group=nb|Within this framework he often used [[syncopation]], as during his guitar solos for the Beatles' covers of Berry's "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" and "[[Too Much Monkey Business]]".{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=62–63, 136}}}} Another of Harrison's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in [[octave]]s, as on "[[I'll Be on My Way]]".{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=134–135}}

By 1964, he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=13}} On this and other songs from the period, he used a [[Rickenbacker 360/12]] – an electric guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart, with the higher four being pairs tuned in unison.{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=134–135}} His use of the Rickenbacker on ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that ''[[Melody Maker]]'' termed it the Beatles' "secret weapon".<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=120}}: "secret weapon"; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=14}}: Harrison helped to popularise the model.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|[[Roger McGuinn]] liked the effect so much that it became his signature guitar sound with the Byrds.{{sfn|Doggett|Hodgson|2004|p=82}}}} In 1965, Harrison used an [[Expression pedal#Guitars and digital effects|expression pedal]] to control his guitar's volume on "[[I Need You (The Beatles song)|I Need You]]", creating a syncopated [[String instrument#Contact points along the string|flautando]] effect with the melody resolving its [[Consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|dissonance]] through tonal displacements.{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=284–285}} He used the same volume-swell technique on "[[Yes It Is]]", applying what Everett described as "ghostly articulation" to the song's [[Harmonic|natural harmonics]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=13}}

In 1966, Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to ''Revolver''. He played [[Backmasking|backwards]] guitar on Lennon's composition "[[I'm Only Sleeping]]" and a guitar [[counter-melody]] on "[[And Your Bird Can Sing]]" that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=47, 49–51}} His guitar playing on "[[I Want to Tell You]]" exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for ''Sgt Pepper''{{'}}s "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" mirrors Lennon's vocal line in much the same way that a [[sarangi]] player accompanies a [[khyal]] singer in a Hindu [[bhajan|devotional song]].<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=58}}: "I Want to Tell You"; {{harvnb|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=179–180}}: Harrison's guitar part for "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds",</ref>

Everett described Harrison's guitar solo from "[[Old Brown Shoe]]" as "stinging [and] highly Claptonesque".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=243}} He identified two of the composition's significant [[Motif (music)|motifs]]: a bluesy [[trichord]] and a [[diminished triad]] with roots in A and E.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=244}} Huntley called the song "a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo".{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=35}} In Greene's opinion, Harrison's demo for "Old Brown Shoe" contains "one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song".{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=140}}

Harrison's playing on ''Abbey Road'', and in particular on "Something", marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist. The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian [[Gamaka (music)|gamakas]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=42}} According to author and musicologist [[Kenneth Womack]]: {{"'}}Something' meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison's guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime".{{sfn|Womack|2006|p=189}}

After [[Delaney Bramlett]] inspired him to learn slide guitar, Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work, which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the sarangi and the [[Esraj|dilruba]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=84–85}} Leng described Harrison's slide guitar solo on Lennon's "[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?"]] as a departure for "the sweet soloist of 'Something{{'"}}, calling his playing "rightly famed ... one of Harrison's greatest guitar statements".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=109}} Lennon commented: "That's the best he's ever fucking played in his life."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=109}}

A [[Music of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] influence is notable in much of Harrison's music, ranging from his slide guitar work on ''Gone Troppo'' (1982) to his televised performance of the [[Cab Calloway]] standard "[[Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (song)|Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea]]" on [[ukulele]] in 1992.<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=29–30}}: Performing "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea" with Holland; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=232}}: Hawaiian influence on ''Gone Troppo''.</ref> Lavezzoli described Harrison's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental "Marwa Blues" (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian [[sarod]] or [[veena]], calling it "yet another demonstration of Harrison's unique slide approach".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=198}} Harrison was an admirer of [[George Formby]] and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of "[[Free as a Bird]]".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=279}} He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society.{{sfn|Huntley|2006|pp=149, 232}} Harrison played bass guitar on a few tracks, including the Beatles songs "[[She Said She Said]]", "[[Golden Slumbers]]", "[[Birthday (The Beatles song)|Birthday]]" and "[[Honey Pie]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=65: "She Said She Said", 268: "Golden Slumbers", 196: "Birthday", 190: "Honey Pie"}}</ref> He also played bass on several solo recordings, including "[[Faster (George Harrison song)|Faster]]", "[[Wake Up My Love]]" and "[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)#George Harrison's version|Bye Bye Love]]".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=205: "Faster", 230: "Wake Up My Love", 152: "Bye Bye Love"}}

===Sitar and Indian music===
[[File:Musicians Ravi Shankar and George Harrison in Los Angeles, Calif., 1967.jpg|thumb|Harrison learned [[sitar]] from [[Ravi Shankar]] (pictured in 1967).]]
During the Beatles' American tour in August 1965, Harrison's friend [[David Crosby]] of the Byrds introduced him to [[Indian classical music]] and the work of [[sitar]] maestro [[Ravi Shankar]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=147}} Harrison described Shankar as "the first person who ever impressed me in my life&nbsp;... and he was the only person who didn't try to impress me."{{sfn|Harrison|2011|p=216}} Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in [[Music of India|Indian music]].{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=172}} According to Lavezzoli, Harrison's introduction of the instrument on the Beatles' song "Norwegian Wood" "opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar would call 'The Great Sitar Explosion' of 1966–67".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=171}} Lavezzoli recognises Harrison as "the man most responsible for this phenomenon".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=171–172}}{{refn|group=nb|Harrison was influential in the decision to have Shankar included on the bill at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967, and at [[Woodstock]] in 1969.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=106, 172}}}}

In June 1966, Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} Before this meeting, Harrison had recorded his ''Revolver'' track "[[Love You To]]", contributing a sitar part that Lavezzoli describes as an "astonishing improvement" over "Norwegian Wood" and "the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=175}} On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram & Sons in New Delhi.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} In September, following the Beatles' final tour, he returned to India to study sitar for six weeks with Shankar.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} He initially stayed in Bombay until fans learned of his arrival, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake in [[Kashmir]].{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} During this visit, he also received tutelage from [[Shambhu Das]], Shankar's protégé.{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=206}}{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=71}}

Harrison studied the instrument until 1968, when, following a discussion with Shankar about the need to find his "roots", an encounter with Clapton and [[Jimi Hendrix]] at a hotel in New York convinced him to return to guitar playing. Harrison commented: "I decided&nbsp;... I'm not going to be a great sitar player&nbsp;... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier."<ref>{{harvnb|Harrison|2002|p=57}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=184–185}}: (secondary source).</ref> Harrison continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on his solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=172–173, 197}} Lavezzoli groups him with [[Paul Simon]] and [[Peter Gabriel]] as the three rock musicians who have given the most "mainstream exposure to non-Western musics, or the concept of '[[world music]]{{'"}}.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=81}}

===Songwriting===
Harrison wrote his first song, "Don't Bother Me", while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as "an exercise to see if I ''could'' write a song", <!--emphasis in original-->as he remembered.{{sfn|Harrison|2002|p=84}} His songwriting ability improved throughout the Beatles' career, but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon, McCartney and producer [[George Martin]] until near the group's break-up.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=38–39}} In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: "Until this year, our songs have been better than George's. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours".<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=554}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Fawcett|1977|p=96}}: (secondary source).</ref> Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2008|p=174}}{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=413}} Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions; three of his songs appear on ''Revolver'', "the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter", according to Inglis.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|pp=xv: most Beatles albums contain at least two Harrison compositions, 7:''Revolver''}}

Harrison wrote the [[chord progression]] of "Don't Bother Me" almost exclusively in the [[Dorian mode]], demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music.{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=193–94}} The latter proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles. According to [[Mikal Gilmore]] of ''Rolling Stone'', "Harrison's openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on&nbsp;... 'Taxman' and 'I Want to Tell You' was revolutionary in popular music – and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Edgard Varèse]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]&nbsp;...".{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|p=37}}

Of the 1967 Harrison song "Within You Without You", author Gerry Farrell said that Harrison had created a "new form", calling the composition "a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=31}} Lennon called the song one of Harrison's best: "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=243}} In his next fully Indian-styled song, "The Inner Light", Harrison embraced the [[Carnatic music|Karnatak]] discipline of Indian music, rather than the [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] style he had used in "Love You To" and "Within You Without You".<ref>{{harvnb|Harrison|2002|p=118}}; {{harvnb|Lavezzoli|2006|p=183}}; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|p=87}}.</ref> Writing in 1997, Farrell commented: "It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion – for example, '[[Blue Jay Way]]' and 'The Inner Light'."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=316}}

Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described "Something" as a masterpiece, and "an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge 'Yesterday' and 'Michelle' as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=837}} Inglis considered ''Abbey Road'' a turning point in Harrison's development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrison's two contributions to the LP, "Here Comes the Sun" and "Something", as "exquisite", declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=15}}

===Collaborations===

==Personal life==
===Hinduism===
[[File:George Harrison Vrindavan.jpg|thumb|alt=Harrison with two Hare Krishna devotees, 1996|Harrison, with [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] devotees Shyamasundar Das and [[Mukunda Goswami]], in [[Vrindavan]], India, in 1996]]
By the mid-1960s, Harrison had become an admirer of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles.{{sfn|Schaffner|1980|pp=77–78}} During the filming of ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' in the Bahamas, they met the founder of [[Sivananda Yoga]], [[Vishnudevananda Saraswati|Swami Vishnu-devananda]], who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, ''[[The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga]]'' (1960).{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=173}} Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the ''Sgt Pepper'' recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his first wife, [[Pattie Boyd]]; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several [[guru]]s, and visited various holy places.{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=33}} In 1968, [[The Beatles in India|he travelled with the other Beatles]] to [[Rishikesh]] in northern India to study meditation with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=33}}{{refn|group=nb|Harrison credited English sculptor [[David Wynne (sculptor)|David Wynne]] as the person who first recommended the Mararishi as a "remarkable" yogi, after which the Beatles attended a lecture he gave in London in August 1967.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=260}}}}

Harrison's experiences with LSD in the mid-1960s served as a catalyst for his early pursuance of Hinduism. In a 1977 interview, George recalled:

{{Blockquote|For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.{{sfn|Glazer|1977|p=41}}}}

However, Harrison stopped using LSD after a disenchanting experience in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood. He recounted in ''The Beatles Anthology'':

{{Blockquote|That was the turning point for me – that's when I went right off the whole drug cult and stopped taking the dreaded lysergic acid. I had some in a little bottle – it was liquid. I put it under a microscope, and it looked like bits of old rope. I thought that I couldn't put that into my brain any more.{{sfn|The Beatles|2000}}}}

After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966, he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] – yogis and authors, respectively, of ''[[Raja Yoga (book)|Raja Yoga]]'' (1896) and ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'' (1946).<ref>{{harvnb|Greene|2006|pp=68–73}}; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|pp=56–58}}.</ref> In mid-1969, he produced the single "[[Hare Krishna Mantra (song)|Hare Krishna Mantra]]", performed by members of the London [[Radha Krishna Temple]].{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=153}} Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain, Harrison then met their leader, [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], whom he described as "my friend ... my master" and "a perfect example of everything he preached".<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2003|pp=267–70}}; {{harvnb|Cremo|1997|pp=26–27}}.</ref> Harrison embraced the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna tradition]], particularly ''[[Japa|japa-yoga]]'' chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=153}} In 1972 he donated his [[Letchmore Heath]] mansion north of London to the devotees. It was later converted to a temple and renamed [[Bhaktivedanta Manor]].<ref>{{harvnb|Huntley|2006|p=87}}; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|p=111}}.</ref>

Regarding other faiths, he once remarked: "All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call."{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=78}} He commented on his beliefs:

{{Blockquote|[[Krishna]] actually was in a body as a person&nbsp;... What makes it complicated is, if he's God, what's he doing fighting on a battlefield? It took me ages to try to figure that out, and again it was Yogananda's spiritual interpretation of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' that made me realise what it was. Our idea of Krishna and [[Arjuna]] on the battlefield in the chariot. So this is the point – that we're in these bodies, which is like a kind of chariot, and we're going through this incarnation, this life, which is kind of a battlefield. The senses of the body&nbsp;... are the horses pulling the chariot, and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins. And Arjuna in the end says, "Please Krishna, you drive the chariot" because unless we bring [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]] or Krishna or [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] or whichever of our spiritual guides&nbsp;... we're going to crash our chariot, and we're going to turn over, and we're going to get killed in the battlefield. That's why we say "''Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna''{{-"}}, asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot.{{sfn|Glazer|1977|pp=39–40}}}}

Inglis comments that, in contrast to [[Cliff Richard]]'s conversion to Christianity in 1966: "Harrison's spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music's increasing maturity&nbsp;... what he, and the Beatles, had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs."{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=11}}

===Relationships with the other Beatles===
[[File:The Beatles arrive at JFK Airport.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=The Beatles in New York City in 1964, waving to a large crowd|Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr on arrival in New York City at the height of [[Beatlemania]], February 1964]]
For most of the Beatles' career, the relationships in the group were close. According to [[Hunter Davies]], "the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other's greatest friends." Harrison's ex-wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles "all belonged to each other" and admitted, "George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it."{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=325}} Starr said, "We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other." He added, "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=357}}

Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was "one of young follower and older guy&nbsp;... [he] was like a disciple of mine when we started."{{sfn|Sheff|1981|p=148}} The two later bonded over their [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, with, according to biographer Gary Tillery, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=122}} In 1974, Harrison said of his former bandmate: "John Lennon is a saint and he's heavy-duty, and he's great and I love him. But at the same time, he's such a ''bastard'' – but that's the great thing about him, you see?"{{sfn|Harrison|1975|page=event occurs at 30 minutes 3–15 seconds}}

Harrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|pp=xiii–xiv}} McCartney said that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Joan|last=Goodman|title=Playboy interview: Paul and Linda McCartney|magazine=[[Playboy]]|date=December 1984|page=84}}</ref> McCartney has referred to Harrison as his "baby brother".<ref>{{Cite news|first1=Oliver|last1=Poole|first2=Hugh|last2=Davies|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html|title=I'll always love him, he's my baby brother, says tearful McCartney|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London, England|date=1 December 2001|access-date=22 January 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507033014/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html|archive-date=7 May 2012}}</ref> In a 1974 BBC radio interview with [[Alan Freeman]], Harrison stated: "[McCartney] ruined me as a guitar player". In the same interview, however, Harrison stated that "I just know that whatever we've been through, there's always been something that's tied us together."{{sfn|Badman|2001|pp=138–139}} Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney's personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other's nerves.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|p=48}} Rodriguez commented: "Even to the end of George's days, theirs was a volatile relationship".{{sfn|Rodriguez|2010|p=24}} When, in a [[Yahoo]] online chat in February 2001, he was asked if Paul "[pisses] you off", Harrison replied "Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass -- You know his faults -- Then let his foibles pass. Old Victorian Proverb. I'm sure there's enough about me that pisses him off, but I think we have now grown old enough to realize that we're both pretty damn cute!"<ref>{{cite web |url= https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/george-harrison-yahoo-chat-transcript-02-15-2001.11962/ |title= George Harrison Yahoo!
