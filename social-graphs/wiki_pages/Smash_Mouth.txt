The band adopted retro styles covering several decades of [[popular music]]. They have also performed numerous [[cover song|covers]] of popular songs, including [[War (U.S. band)|War]]'s "[[Why Can't We Be Friends? (song)|Why Can't We Be Friends?]]", [[Rick Astley]]’s “[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]”, [[Simple Minds]]' "[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]", [[? & the Mysterians]]' "[[Can't Get Enough of You Baby]]", [[The Beatles]]' "[[Getting Better]]", [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Under Pressure]]", [[House of Pain]]'s "[[Jump Around]]", and "[[I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)|I Wan'na Be Like You]]" from ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''. They also composed two songs for the South Korean animated film ''[[Pororo, The Racing Adventure]]'': "Beside Myself" and "Everything Just Crazy".

==History==
===1990–1997: formation and ''Fush Yu Mang''===
Smash Mouth's roots trace back to 1990 when [[Steve Harwell]] and Kevin Coleman met. Smash Mouth was then formed in 1994 by Harwell, who had formerly played in a [[rapping|rap]] group called F.O.S. (Freedom of Speech). Coleman, who was Harwell's manager, knew guitarist [[Greg Camp]] and bassist [[Paul De Lisle]], who had both played in a local [[punk music|punk]] band, and introduced the three musicians to each other. They began rehearsing together along with Coleman, who played as the drummer. They soon developed into a band, and named themselves [[Smashmouth offense|Smashmouth]], an [[American football]] term. During their early years, the band played largely [[rock music]].

The band's first publicity came when a demo of the song "Nervous in the Alley" was played by a San Jose radio station, [[KOME]]. Soon after, [[Interscope Records]] signed the band, and the group's debut album, ''[[Fush Yu Mang]]'', was released in 1997, featuring another member: the keyboardist Michael Klooster. Also, upon signing to Interscope Records, the band changed their name from Smashmouth to Smash Mouth. The album eventually went [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] led by the band's first major single "[[Walkin' on the Sun]]". The singles "The Fonz" and a cover of "[[Why Can't We Be Friends (song)|Why Can't We Be Friends]]" from the 1998 [[Kevin Bacon]] film ''[[Wild Things (film)|Wild Things]]'' were also subsequently released.

===1998–2004: rise to fame, ''Astro Lounge'', ''Smash Mouth'', and ''Get the Picture?''===
The band's second album, ''[[Astro Lounge]]'', was released in 1999 and marked a change in direction, as it had less of the previous [[ska]] influence and more of a pop sound. It led to more publicity for the band, and ended up being one of the most critically acclaimed albums from the group. Supported by the hit singles "[[All Star (song)|All Star]]" (which was featured in several film soundtracks, most notably in ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001), although the official [[music video]] references ''[[Mystery Men]]'') and "[[Then the Morning Comes]]", ''Astro Lounge'' was eventually certified as triple platinum.

Also in 1999, ''The East Bay Sessions'' was released as a collection of early songs.  Shortly after the release of the album, drummer Kevin Coleman left the band due to back problems.  He was initially replaced by [[Michael Urbano]], who was quickly replaced by Mitch Marine for the tour supporting ''Astro Lounge'', who was subsequently replaced by Urbano after the tour.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p215667/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

In 2001, Smash Mouth covered [[the Monkees]]' hit song "[[I'm a Believer (Smash Mouth song)|I'm a Believer]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046298 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113091657/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046298 |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 13, 2006 |title=Yahoo Music – Exclusive New Music and Music Videos |publisher=Music.yahoo.com |date=April 20, 2011 |access-date=April 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It was featured on both the soundtrack for ''[[Shrek]]'' (along with "All Star") and their [[Smash Mouth (album)|self-titled album]].<ref name="Allmusic"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=Baker |first1=Naomi Keusch |title=Smash Mouth Tries to Escape 'Shrek' at Alumni Concert |url=https://emorywheel.com/smash-mouth-tries-to-escape-shrek-at-alumni-concert/ |access-date=3 June 2023 |work=[[The Emory Wheel]] |date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920112247/https://emorywheel.com/smash-mouth-tries-to-escape-shrek-at-alumni-concert/ |archive-date=September 20, 2019}}</ref> The album sold fewer copies than the band's earlier works, eventually being certified [[RIAA certification|gold]]. Also in 2001, the group appeared as themselves in the climactic scene of the film ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''.

In 2003, ''[[Get the Picture? (Smash Mouth album)|Get the Picture?]]'' was released, featuring the singles "You Are My Number One", "Hang On" and "Always Gets Her Way". Smash Mouth was dropped from [[Interscope]] shortly after the release of ''Get the Picture?''. That same year, the band performed a cover of the [[Sherman Brothers]] song "[[I Wanna Be Like You]]" for the animated film ''[[The Jungle Book 2]]''.

===2005–2011: new label, fluctuating lineup and ''Summer Girl''===
Smash Mouth released the greatest hits compilation ''[[All Star Smash Hits]]'' in 2005. The album contains some more popular songs from previous Smash Mouth albums, as well as songs from soundtrack albums that were not on the band's releases. On certain networks and time slots, the album was advertised as having 18 tracks, including an edited version of "Flo". Smash Mouth played at [[Gumby]]'s Birthday Celebration in August 2005.

In December 2005, the band released a Christmas album ''[[Gift of Rock]]''. It featured covers of Christmas songs by many artists, such as [[the Kinks]] and [[the Ramones]], and one original song, "Baggage Claim".

Smash Mouth's fifth studio album, originally to be titled ''[[Old Habits (album)|Old Habits]]'', was recorded in 2005 and expected to be released in early 2006. The band had said that the album was much more like the ska punk featured on ''Fush Yu Mang'' and ''The East Bay Sessions''. In September 2005, the band performed what was tentatively going to be the album's first single, "Getaway Car", on ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''. The album was delayed many times, in the hope of gaining publicity with Harwell's appearance on the reality show ''[[The Surreal Life]]''. Smash Mouth returned to the studio intent on improving the record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/articles/7888.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230151924/http://www.sheknows.com/articles/7888.htm|url-status=dead|title=SheKnows gets to know Smash Mouth|archive-date=December 30, 2008}}</ref> ''Old Habits'' was shelved, replaced by ''[[Summer Girl]]'', which included some remixed ''Old Habits'' tracks as well as new songs. After being delayed in much the same way ''Old Habits'' was for several months, the album was released on September 19, 2006. Smash Mouth let Sony Pictures use much of their music from ''Summer Girl'' and other songs for the movie ''[[Zoom (2006 film)|Zoom]]'', whose opening titles credit the film's music to the band.

Before the release of ''Summer Girl'', drummer Michael Urbano left the band without warning on February 14, 2006 due to creative differences. He was initially replaced by former drummer Mitch Marine, and then by Jason Sutter, best known for his work with [[American Hi-Fi]] and [[the Rembrandts]]. The band released their new album, ''[[Summer Girl]]'', later that year. In early 2007, one year after joining the band, Sutter left Smash Mouth to play drums for former [[Soundgarden]] and [[Audioslave]] frontman [[Chris Cornell]]; fill-in drummer Marine returned to Smash Mouth.

Band members changed over the course of several years.<ref name="Freeman 2011">{{cite news |last1=Freeman |first1=Paul |title=Smash Mouth: Still San Jose's All Stars |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/06/29/smash-mouth-still-san-joses-all-stars/ |access-date=3 June 2023 |work=[[The Mercury News]] |date=30 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920113226/https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/06/29/smash-mouth-still-san-joses-all-stars/ |archive-date=September 20, 2019}}</ref> Greg Camp left the band in the summer of 2008. Smash Mouth recruited [[Leroy (musician)|Leroy Miller]] to play guitar. Leroy left in 2009 and Camp returned to the band, but in 2011 Camp left once again and this time the band recruited Sean Hurwitz. Hurwitz stayed until 2012, and was replaced by Mike Krompass. Later in 2012, Hurwitz returned. In 2009 Mitch Marine left once again and was replaced by Urbano, who left again after only one year in 2010, and was replaced by Marine once again. Marine left yet again after a brief spell in 2010 and was replaced by [[Randy Cooke]]. Cooke was briefly replaced by Jason Sutter in 2011, then Charlie Paxson.

In June 2011, a writer at [[Something Awful]] offered $20 if the band's lead singer, Steve Harwell, would eat 24 eggs.<ref name="Hendren 2011">{{cite web |last1=Hendren |first1=Jon "@fart" |title=Smash Mouth: Please Eat the Eggs |url=https://www.somethingawful.com/news/smash-mouth-eggs/ |website=somethingawful.com |publisher=[[Something Awful]] |access-date=3 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707222959/http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/smash-mouth-eggs.php |archive-date=July 7, 2011 |date=June 4, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Others on Twitter began offering additional sums, eventually targeted to various charities.<ref name="Hendren 2011"/> In July 2011, Harwell accepted the challenge if fans could gather pledges of $10,000 for [[St. Jude Children's Hospital]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/guy-from-smash-mouth-to-smash-eggs-in-mouth-for-charity/2011/07/07/gIQA3nzK2H_blog.html |title=Guy from Smash Mouth to smash eggs in mouth for charity |author=Sarah Anne Hughes |newspaper=Washington Post |date=July 7, 2011 |access-date=July 7, 2011 |archive-date=November 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112174712/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/guy-from-smash-mouth-to-smash-eggs-in-mouth-for-charity/2011/07/07/gIQA3nzK2H_blog.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The fundraising goal was reached in less than a week.<ref>Popdust.com, July 11, 2011, "[http://popdust.com/2011/07/11/smash-mouth-steve-harwell-eat-eggs-something-awful/ Official: Smash Mouth Will Eat The Eggs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717041449/http://popdust.com/2011/07/11/smash-mouth-steve-harwell-eat-eggs-something-awful/ |date=July 17, 2011 }}" Retrieved July 11, 2011.</ref> A self-styled "reality TV fan," Harwell requested that his friend celebrity chef [[Guy Fieri]] prepare the eggs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/12/smash-mouth-will-eat-the-_n_895530.html |title=Smash Mouth Will Eat The Eggs, Harwell Wants A Celeb Chef To Cook Them |last=Votta |first=Rae |work=The Huffington Post |date=July 12, 2011 |access-date=July 12, 2011 |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715215620/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/12/smash-mouth-will-eat-the-_n_895530.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The event was held at Johnny Garlic's restaurant, in [[Dublin, California]], on October 11, 2011.

===2012–2019: ''Magic'', live album and reunion with Camp===
After parting ways with [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal Records]] and signing with 429 Records, Smash Mouth released their sixth studio album titled ''[[Magic (Smash Mouth album)|Magic]]'', on September 4, 2012. The album was primarily produced by new band member Mike Krompass. The first single, also entitled "Magic", debuted on the [[Billboard Adult Contemporary]] chart at No. 22.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/279617/smash+mouth/chart?f=341 |title=Smash Mouth – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=April 23, 2014 |archive-date=June 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619053401/http://www.billboard.com/artist/279617/smash+mouth/chart?f=341 |url-status=live }}</ref> The band spent the rest of 2012 touring behind the new project as well as promoting the release of their musical book of food recipes and things of the like — ''Recipes from the Road''. Cooke temporarily left again toward the end of 2012, replaced by Paxson. In 2013 the band took part in the "Under the Sun" tour with [[Gin Blossoms]] and [[Sugar Ray]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Under The Sun Tour 2013 At Stage AE |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/pictures/under-the-sun-tour-2013-at-stage-ae/8/ |access-date=3 June 2023 |work=[[KDKA-TV]] |date=30 July 2013}}</ref> Paxson left in July during the tour, and was initially going to be replaced by a returning Cooke; however, he was replaced by Sutter once again. Tod Burr, former drum tech of [[Def Leppard]] and drummer of Merle Jagger, came on board in 2012 as drum and keyboard tech of Smash Mouth.

On February 1, 2013, Smash Mouth headlined the [[AutoNation]] Coast to Coast rebranding event (which combined all AutoNation dealerships into a single brand) at [[Wayne Huizenga]] Park in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] with Michela Paige from Season 3 of ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]''. The event also served as a final round in the AutoNation Culture of Caring Contest.

On October 6, 2014, Smash Mouth composed two songs for the English version of the South Korean animated film ''[[Pororo, The Racing Adventure]]'', including "Beside Myself", and "Everything Just Crazy" which plays at the end credits.

In 2014, Smash Mouth was part of the "Under the Sun" tour with [[Uncle Kracker]], [[Blues Traveler]], and Sugar Ray.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Winistorfer |first1=Andrew |title=When It's Over: I Saw Smash Mouth, Uncle Kracker, Blues Traveler, and Sugar Ray in Small Town Wisconsin |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/smash-mouth-uncle-kracker-blues-traveler-sugar-ray-live-review/ |access-date=3 June 2023 |work=[[Vice Media|Vice]] |date=23 July 2014 |language=en}}</ref>

On June 14, 2015, Smash Mouth performed at the Taste of Fort Collins food festival in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. Before the encore, in an incident that lasted about three minutes, singer Steve Harwell became angry, yelled profanities at the audience, and left the stage after bread that had been distributed by the festival was thrown in the air and a few pieces were reportedly thrown onto the stage.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hey now!

He continued "It wasn't like anyone was going to be getting hurt by throwing bread up in the air ... We just had to laugh at it, because he just really made a fool of himself."<ref name="Sexton 2015">{{Cite web|last=Sexton|first=Josie|title=Taste organizer: Smash Mouth lead made a fool of himself|url=https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2015/06/15/smash-mouth-bread/71259104/|access-date=2023-01-15|website=Fort Collins Coloradoan|language=en-US}}</ref> Fort Collins Police Services stated laws prohibiting disorderly conduct, harassment, and 'throwing of "missiles,"' i.e. objects, apply to event attendees.<ref name="Sexton 2015"/>

In May 2016, Smash Mouth released their first [[live album]] titled ''Playlist: The Very Best of Smash Mouth'' through [[Sony Music]]. The recordings were harvested from shows in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], and [[Manila]].

2016 saw the band gain a new member in Sam Eigen and the return of Cooke. Eigen is a long-time friend of both Steve Harwell and Paul De Lisle, and has played with [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Janet Jackson]], and [[John Fogerty]]. He can also be heard playing guitar on several of Harwell's solo recordings over the years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smashmouth.com/about|title=ABOUT|website=Smashmouth.com|access-date=December 20, 2019|archive-date=September 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200927234904/https://www.smashmouth.com/about|url-status=live}}</ref>

On November 1, 2018, Smash Mouth released the single "Unity". It features hip-hop artists [[Kool Keith]] and [[Darryl McDaniels]] of [[Run-DMC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Smash-Mouth-Darryl-DMC-McDaniels-and-Kool-Keith-Release-UNITY-20181101|title=Smash Mouth, Darryl 'DMC' McDaniels and Kool Keith Release 'UNITY'|date=November 1, 2018|website=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=November 2, 2018|archive-date=February 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213005800/https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Smash-Mouth-Darryl-DMC-McDaniels-and-Kool-Keith-Release-UNITY-20181101|url-status=live}}</ref> They then toured Australia in the same year during November to sell-out crowds around the country, performing a mix of theater, festival, and pub shows. During the Arlie Beach Festival of Music in [[Queensland]], Steve Harwell became ill and had to leave the stage.

On August 8, 2020, the band performed at the 2020 [[Sturgis Rally]] and vocalist Harwell said things such as "fuck that COVID shit" during the performance. A report from the [[IZA Institute of Labor Economics]] later cited the event as being a [[superspreading event]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Sturgis biker rally with Smash Mouth was 'superspreading event,' report says| first = Josh K.| last = Elliott| work = Global News| date = September 9, 2020| access-date = 11 July 2021| url = https://globalnews.ca/news/7323729/sturgis-rally-coronavirus-superspreading-smash-mouth/| archive-date = January 28, 2022| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220128033831/https://globalnews.ca/news/7323729/sturgis-rally-coronavirus-superspreading-smash-mouth/| url-status = live}}</ref>
