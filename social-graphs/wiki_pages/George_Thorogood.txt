Thorogood has been a baseball fan<ref name="WGN" /> for most of his life, playing semi-pro ball as a second baseman during the 1970s (drummer Jeff Simon played center field on the same team). He took his daughter to Chicago for her first major league game ([[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] vs. [[Colorado Rockies|Rockies]]), during which he sang "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]". In a 2011 ''[[Guitar World]]'' interview, he stated "I'm a [[New York Mets|Mets]] fan. There aren't many of us but you know, that's me."<ref name="gw" />

In April 2023, Thorogood had to cancel the first leg of his 50th anniversary tour due to a serious medical condition.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/george-thorogood-cancels-tour-dates-after-being-diagnosed-with-very-serious-medical-condition |title=George Thorogood Cancels Tour Dates After Being Diagnosed with 'Very Serious Medical Condition' |date=April 11, 2023 |website=blabbermouth.net}}</ref>
