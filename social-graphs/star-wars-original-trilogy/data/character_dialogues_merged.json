    "Did you hear that? They've shut down",
    "the main reactor. We'll be destroyed",
    "for sure. This is madness!",
    "Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in",
    "the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.",
    "We're doomed!",
    "The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that",
    "only another robot could understand.",
    "There'll be no escape for the Princess",
    "this time.",
    "Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as",
    "loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment",
    "are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.",
    "What's that?",
    "I should have known better than to",
    "trust the logic of a half-sized",
    "thermocapsulary dehousing assister...",
    "Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages",
    "around the two hapless robots.",
    "Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?",
    "A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and",
    "he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-",
    "filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years",
    "old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place,",
    "dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting",
    "something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little",
    "robot joins his companion.",
    "At last! Where have you been?",
    "Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.",
    "They're heading in this direction.",
    "What are we going to do? We'll be",
    "sent to the spice mine of Kessel or",
    "smashed into who knows what!",
    "Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the",
    "subhallway. Threepio chases after him.",
    "Wait a minute, where are you going?",
    "Artoo responds with electronic beeps.",
    "Hey, you're not permitted in there.",
    "It's restricted. You'll be deactivated",
    "for sure..",
    "Artoo beeps something to him.",
    "Don't call me a mindless philosopher,",
    "you overweight glob of grease! Now",
    "come out before somebody sees you.",
    "Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding",
    "the mission he is about to perform.",
    "Secret mission? What plans? What are",
    "you talking about? I'm not getting",
    "in there!",
    "Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps",
    "and twangs angrily.",
    "A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris",
    "through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,",
    "after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky",
    "robot jumps into the lifepod.",
    "I'm going to regret this.",
    "That's funny, the damage doesn't",
    "look as bad from out here.",
    "Artoo beeps an assuring response.",
    "Are you sure this things safe?",
    "How did I get into this mess? I really",
    "don't know how. We seem to be made",
    "to suffer. It's our lot in life.",
    "Artoo answers with beeping sounds.",
    "I've got to rest before I fall apart.",
    "My joints are almost frozen.",
    "Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.",
    "What a desolate place this is.",
    "Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts",
    "off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio",
    "stops and yells at him.",
    "Where are you going?",
    "A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small",
    "robot.",
    "Well, I'm not going that way. It's",
    "much too rocky. This way is much",
    "easier.",
    "Artoo counters with a long whistle.",
    "What makes you think there are",
    "settlements over there?",
    "Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.",
    "Don't get technical with me.",
    "Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.",
    "What mission? What are you talking",
    "about? I've had just about enough of",
    "you! Go that way! You'll be",
    "malfunctioning within a day, you",
    "nearsighted scrap pile!",
    "Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the",
    "direction of the vast dune sea.",
    "And don't let me catch you following",
    "me begging for help, because you",
    "won't get it.",
    "Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges",
    "off in the direction of the towering mesas.",
    "No more adventures. I'm not going",
    "that way.",
    "Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant",
    "mountains.",
    "That malfunctioning little twerp.",
    "This is all his fault! He tricked me",
    "into going this way, but he'll do no",
    "better.",
    "In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand",
    "from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of",
    "reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving",
    "towards him.",
    "Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm",
    "saved!",
    "The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the",
    "approaching transport.",
    "Over here! Help! Please, help!",
    "Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!",
    "A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.",
    "Wake up! Wake up!",
    "Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,",
    "creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.",
    "Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights",
    "pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long",
    "chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding",
    "white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the",
    "odd assortment of robots.",
    "We're doomed.",
    "A Jawa starts moving toward them.",
    "Do you think they'll melt us down?",
    "Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.",
    "Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this",
    "never end?",
    "Sir -- not in an environment such as",
    "this -- that's why I've also been",
    "programmed for over thirty secondary",
    "functions that...",
    "Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was",
    "programming binary load lifter...",
    "very similar to your vaporators. You",
    "could say...",
    "Of course I can, sir. It's like a",
    "second language for me... I'm as",
    "fluent in Bocce...",
    "Shutting up, sir.",
    "Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is",
    "in prime condition. A real bargain.",
    "Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very",
    "pleased with that one, sir. He really",
    "is in first-class condition. I've",
    "worked with him before. Here he comes.",
    "Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots",
    "trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.",
    "Now, don't you forget this! Why I",
    "should stick my neck out for you is",
    "quite beyond my capacity!",
    "Thank the maker! This oil bath is",
    "going to feel so good. I've got such",
    "a bad case of dust contamination, I",
    "can barely move!",
    "Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought",
    "as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man",
    "Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage.",
    "Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he",
    "slams a wrench across the workbench.",
    "Is there anything I might do to help?",
    "Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains",
    "and a tiny smile creeps across his face.",
    "I don't think so, sir. I'm only a",
    "droid and not very knowledgeable",
    "about such things. Not on this planet,",
    "anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm",
    "not even sure which planet I'm on.",
    "I see, sir.",
    "I see, sir Luke.",
    "And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg",
    "relations, and this is my counterpart,",
    "Artoo-Detoo.",
    "With all we've been through, sometimes",
    "I'm amazed we're in as good condition",
    "as we are, what with the Rebellion",
    "and all.",
    "That's how we came to be in your",
    "service, if you take my meaning,",
    "sir.",
    "Several, I think. Actually, there's",
    "not much to tell. I'm not much more",
    "than an interpreter, and not very",
    "good at telling stories. Well, not",
    "at making them interesting, anyways.",
    "Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's",
    "neck joint. He uses a larger pick.",
    "What is what?!? He asked you a",
    "question...",
    "What is that?",
    "Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice",
    "the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer",
    "for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the",
    "sentence fragment over and over.",
    "Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely",
    "a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no",
    "mind.",
    "Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.",
    "I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.",
    "I think she was a passenger on our",
    "last voyage. A person of some",
    "importance, sir -- I believe. Our",
    "captain was attached to...",
    "Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going",
    "to get us in trouble. It's all right,",
    "you can trust him. He's our new",
    "master.",
    "Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.",
    "He says he's the property of Obi-Wan",
    "Kenobi, a resident of these parts.",
    "And it's a private message for him.",
    "Quite frankly, sir I don't know what",
    "he's talking about. Our last master",
    "was Captain Antilles, but with what",
    "we've been through, this little R2",
    "unit has become a bit eccentric.",
    "I beg your pardon, sir, but do you",
    "know what he's talking about?",
    "He says the restraining bolt has",
    "short circuited his recording system.",
    "He suggests that if you remove the",
    "bolt, he might be able to play back",
    "the entire recording.",
    "Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't",
    "really heard what Threepio has been saying.",
    "What message? The one you're carrying",
    "inside your rusty innards!",
    "A women's voice calls out from another room.",
    "I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to",
    "have picked up a slight flutter.",
    "Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and",
    "hurries out of the room.",
    "Just you reconsider playing that",
    "message for him.",
    "Artoo beeps in response.",
    "No, I don't think he likes you at",
    "all.",
    "Artoo beeps.",
    "No, I don't like you either.",
    "It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't",
    "deactivate me. I told him not to go,",
    "but he's faulty, malfunctioning;",
    "kept babbling on about his mission.",
    "That R2 unit has always been a",
    "problem. These astro-droids are",
    "getting quite out of hand. Even I",
    "can't understand their logic at times.",
    "Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go",
    "after him?",
    "Oh, he excels at that, sir.",
    "Sir, would it help if you told him",
    "it was my fault.",
    "Deactivate! Well, on the other hand",
    "if you hadn't removed his restraining",
    "bolt...",
    "Master Luke here is your rightful",
    "owner. We'll have no more of this",
    "Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't",
    "talk to me about your mission, either.",
    "You're fortunate he doesn't blast",
    "you into a million pieces right here.",
    "If you don't mind my saying so, sir,",
    "I think you should deactivate the",
    "little fugitive until you've gotten",
    "him back to your workshop.",
    "Oh my... sir, he says there are",
    "several creatures approaching from",
    "the southeast.",
    "Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.",
    "Where am I? I must have taken a bad",
    "step...",
    "I don't think I can make it. You go",
    "on, Master Luke. There's no sense in",
    "you risking yourself on my account.",
    "I'm done for.",
    "Artoo makes a beeping sound.",
    "Sir, if you'll not be needing me,",
    "I'll close down for awhile.",
    "I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting",
    "creatures.",
    "As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa",
    "away.",
    "Come along, Artoo.",
    "I heartily agree with you sir.",
    "Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the",
    "creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.",
    "Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-",
    "looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with",
    "fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-",
    "covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.",
    "Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,",
    "and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a",
    "sight to behold.",
    "Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times",
    "during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets",
    "out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit",
    "disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between",
    "Ben and the giant Wookiee.",
    "Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips",
    "his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear",
    "or whatever.",
    "A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.",
    "I don't like the look of this.",
    "Lock the door, Artoo.",
    "One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves",
    "on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and",
    "Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.",
    "I would much rather have gone with",
    "Master Luke than stay here with you.",
    "I don't know what all the trouble is",
    "about, but I'm sure it must be your",
    "fault.",
    "Artoo makes beeping sounds.",
    "You watch your language!",
    "Hello, sir.",
    "Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I",
    "hate space travel.",
    "Now be careful, Artoo.",
    "Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his",
    "stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures",
    "to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's",
    "face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.",
    "Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and",
    "begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.",
    "He made a fair move. Screaming about",
    "it won't help you.",
    "But sir, nobody worries about",
    "upsetting a droid.",
    "I see your point, sir. I suggest a",
    "new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee",
    "win.",
    "Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems",
    "frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his",
    "head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.",
    "Han watches with a bit of smugness.",
    "We found the computer outlet, sir.",
    "Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of",
    "the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it",
    "carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.",
    "Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.",
    "He says he's found the main computer",
    "to power the tractor beam that's",
    "holding the ship here. He'll try to",
    "make the precise location appear on",
    "the monitor.",
    "The computer monitor flashes readouts.",
    "The tractor beam is coupled to the",
    "main reactor in seven locations. A",
    "power loss at one of the terminals",
    "will allow the ship to leave.",
    "Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.",
    "I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.",
    "He says \"I found her\", and keeps",
    "repeating, \"She's here.\"",
    "Princess Leia.",
    "Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-",
    "three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to",
    "be terminated.",
    "Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for",
    "asking... but, ah... what should",
    "Artoo and I do if we're discovered",
    "here?",
    "That isn't very reassuring.",
    "Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and",
    "start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.",
    "Yes sir?",
    "I said, all systems have been alerted",
    "to your presence, sir. The main",
    "entrance seems to be the only way in",
    "or out; all other information on",
    "your level is restricted.",
    "Someone begins banging on the door.",
    "Oh, no!",
    "They're madmen! They're heading for",
    "the prison level. If you hurry, you",
    "might catch them.",
    "Come on!",
    "The guard aims a blaster at them.",
    "Oh! All this excitement has overrun",
    "the circuits of my counterpart here.",
    "If you don't mind, I'd like to take",
    "him down to maintenance.",
    "They aren't here! Something must",
    "have happened to them. See if they've",
    "been captured.",
    "Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall",
    "socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from",
    "the tiny robot.",
    "Hurry!",
    "Thank goodness, they haven't found",
    "them! Where could they be?",
    "Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.",
    "Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I",
    "turned it off!",
    "Are you there, sir?",
    "We've had some problems...",
    "No. Shut them all down! Hurry!",
    "Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible",
    "screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.",
    "Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo!",
    "Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast",
    "enough. It's all my fault! My poor",
    "master!",
    "For the moment. Uh, we're in the",
    "main hangar across from the ship.",
    "Where could they be?",
    "Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left",
    "and right, beeping a response.",
    "Come on, Artoo, we're going!",
    "Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who",
    "were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards",
    "Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.",
    "Oooh!",
    "Help! I think I'm melting!",
    "This is all your fault.",
    "Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response.",
    "Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to",
    "come back.",
    "Artoo beeps in agreement.",
    "You wouldn't want my life to get",
    "boring, would you?",
    "Artoo whistles his reply.",
    "All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.",
    "The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the",
    "pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The",
    "hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted",
    "voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses",
    "are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit",
    "shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman,",
    "holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace",
    "of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.",
    "Hang on, Artoo!",
    "Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say",
    "something!",
    "You can repair him, can't you?",
    "You must repair him! Sir, if any of",
    "my circuits or gears will help, I'll",
    "gladly donate them.",
    "Don't try to blame me.  I didn't",
    "ask you to turn on the thermal",
    "heater.  I merely commented that it",
    "was freezing in the princess'",
    "chamber.  But it's supposed to be",
    "freezing.  How are we going to dry",
    "out all her clothes?  I really don't",
    "know.",
    "Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.",
    "Oh, switch off.",
    "Excuse me, sir.",
    "Might I have a word with you,",
    "please?",
    "Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.",
    "She's been trying to get you on",
    "the communicator.",
    "Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering",
    "about Master Luke.  He hasn't come",
    "back yet.  She doesn't know where he",
    "is.",
    "Nobody knows where he is.",
    "Well, uh, you see...",
    "Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.",
    "Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...",
    "Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer",
    "approaches.",
    "Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire",
    "what's going on?",
    "Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo,",
    "let's find Princess Leia.  Between",
    "ourselves, I think Master Luke is",
    "in considerable danger.",
    "You must come along now, Artoo.",
    "There's really nothing more we can",
    "do.  And my joints are freezing up.",
    "Artoo beeps, long and low.",
    "Don't say thing like that!  Of",
    "course we'll see Master Luke again.",
    "He'll be quite all right, you'll see.",
    "Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll",
    "be quite all right.",
    "Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully",
    "keeps his vigil.",
    "Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been",
    "quite unable to pick up any signals,",
    "although he does admit that his own",
    "range is far too weak to abandon",
    "all hope.",
    "Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.",
    "Artoo says the chances of survival",
    "are seven hundred seventy-five...",
    "to one.",
    "Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the",
    "entrance of the ice cave.  The loud booms echo throughout the huge",
    "cavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl.",
    "Actually, Artoo has been known to",
    "make mistakes... from time to time.",
    "Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry",
    "about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll",
    "be all right.  He's quite clever,",
    "you know... for a human being.",
    "Master Luke, sir, it's so good",
    "to see you fully functional again.",
    "Artoo beeps his good wishes.",
    "Artoo expresses his relief, also.",
    "Han and Chewie make their entrance.  The Wookiee growls a greeting.",
    "Excuse us, please.",
    "Sir, I am fluent in six million",
    "forms of communication.  This signal",
    "is not used by the Alliance.  It",
    "could be an Imperial code.",
    "The transmission ends in static.",
    "Artoo, you take good care of",
    "Master Luke now, understand?  And",
    "... do take good care of yourself.",
    "Oh, dear, oh, dear.",
    "Your Highness, we must take this",
    "last transport.  It's our only hope.",
    "Oh!  Wait for me!",
    "But... but... but... where are",
    "you going?  Uh... come back!!",
    "Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!",
    "The door to the hangar closes in his face.",
    "How typical.",
    "Quickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the golden droid",
    "through.",
    "Wait!  Wait!",
    "Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir,",
    "might I suggest that you...",
    "Han gives the gold robot a devastating look.",
    "It can wait.",
    "Sir, sir!  Might I suggest...",
    "But, sir!",
    "The buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.",
    "If I may say so, sir, I noticed",
    "earlier that the hyperdrive",
    "motivator has been damaged.  It's",
    "impossible to go to light-speed!",

    "him?",
    "Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.",
    "Sir, I don't know where your ship",
    "learned to communicate, but it",
    "has the most peculiar dialect.  I",
    "believe, sir, it says that the",

    "of stormtroopers running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the",

    "Ouch!  Pay attention to what",
    "you're doing!",
    "Chewie is in the pit.  He is trying to loosen something with an",

    "Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?",
    "Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.",
    "The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio",

    "droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.",
    "Because he's holding a thermal detonator.",
    "The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the",
    "room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the",
    "bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba",
    "stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across",
    "his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.",

    "Jabba continues.",
    "Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.",
    "Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his",

    "dead.",
    "He agrees!",
    "The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and",
    "applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca",
    "growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a",
    "skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing",
    "girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly",
    "appreciative creatures.",
    "Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the",
    "scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across",
    "the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling",
    "his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.",
    "Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.",
    "At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.",
    "Master Luke, you're standing on...",

    "There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.",
    "Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies",
    "into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his",
    "hand.",
    "Oh, no! The Rancor!",
    "At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged",
    "RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries",
    "futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.",
    "The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the",
    "Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few",
    "screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers",
    "and laughs at the guard's fate.",
    "The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just",
    "ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of",
    "an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his",
    "salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the",
    "monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in",
    "rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an",
    "avalanche.",
    "The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes",
    "into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the",
    "holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility",
    "door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into",
    "the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it",
    "down on the Rancor's finger.",
    "Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed",
    "that you are to be terminated immediately.",
    "You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of",
    "Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.",
    "HAN\t (to Luke)",
    "Doesn't sound so bad.",
    "In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as",
    "you are slowly digested over a thousand years.",
    "Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?",
    "Artoo beeps a quick reply.",
    "Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous.",
    "They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!",
    "Artoo whistles a singsong response.",
    "Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.",
    "Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die",
    "honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba",
    "the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.",
    "Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!",
    "Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream,",
    "crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye",
    "dangling from a wire) hurry off.",
    "Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.",
    "Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself,",
    "tumbling toward the sand.",
    "Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she",
    "has brought around to point down at the deck.",
    "Sounds dangerous.",
    "LEIA\t (to Han)",
    "I wonder who they found to pull that off.",
    "\"Exciting\" is hardly the word I would use.",
    "Here we go again.",
    "Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.",
    "THEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering",
    "through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked",
    "nearby.",
    "Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!",
    "Han, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.",
    "Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's",
    "too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.",
    "Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.",
    "They move off into the woods.",
    "THREEPIO\t (to Artoo)",
    "And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!",
    "Oh, Master Luke.",
    "I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.",
    "HAN\t (gravely)",
    "I hope she's alright.",
    "Chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off",
    "through the foliage.",
    "Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-",
    "op!!",
    "Artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net,",
    "crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they",
    "realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long",
    "spear.",
    "Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!",
    "When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among",
    "themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok",
    "nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In",
    "a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled",
    "bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks",
    "begin to chant at Threepio.",
    "Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million",
    "forms of",
    "communication.",
    "Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive",
    "dialect.  But",
    "I do believe they think I am some sort of god.",
    "Chewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange",
    "\"what next?\" looks.",
    "I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.",
    "It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.",
    "Han moves toward Threepio threateningly.",

    "When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo",
    "beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him,",
    "finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The",

    "The princess? She's here?",
    "Oh, no! We've got to do something.",
    "The droid belongs to her. She's the",
    "one in the message... We've got to",
    "help her.",
    "But he didn't know she was here.",
    "Look, will you just find a way back",
    "into the detention block?",
    "They're going to execute her. Look,",
    "a few minutes ago you said you didn't",
    "want to just wait here to be captured.",
    "Now all you want to do is stay.",
    "But they're going to kill her!",
    "She's rich.",
    "Chewbacca growls.",
    "Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you",
    "were to rescue her, the reward would",
    "be...",
    "Well more wealth that you can imagine.",
    "You'll get it!",
    "You will...",
    "All right.",
    "Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders",
    "there will you?",
    "Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.",
    "Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on",
    "you.",
    "Chewie lets out a hideous growl.",
    "Okay. Han, you put these on.",
    "Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.",
    "Lock the door!",
    "I can't see a thing in this helmet.",
    "A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away",
    "by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and",
    "the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.",
    "Why didn't you say so before?",
    "Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-",
    "three-eight.",
    "He's going to pull us all apart.",
    "What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke",
    "Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.",
    "I'm here to rescue you. I've got",
    "your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben",
    "Kenobi.",
    "Come on!",
    "See-Threepio! See-Threepio!",
    "We've been cut off! Are there any",
    "other ways out of the cell bay?...",
    "What was that? I didn't copy!",
    "There isn't any other way out.",
    "Well, I didn't...",
    "The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in",
    "the wall next to Han, almost frying him.",
    "No! wait!",
    "Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The",
    "laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.",
    "Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes",
    "almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a",
    "rather grim look on her face.",
    "Will you forget it? I already tried",
    "it. It's magnetically sealed!",
    "There's something alive in here!",
    "Something just moves past my leg!",
    "Look! Did you see that?",
    "Help!",
    "Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.",
    "Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.",
    "Anywhere! Oh!!",
    "Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the",
    "muck by the slimy tentacle.",
    "I don't know, it just let go of me",
    "and disappeared...",
    "The walls are moving!",
    "Wait a minute!",
    "Luke pulls out his comlink.",
    "Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio!",
    "Where could he be?",
    "Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!",
    "Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole.",
    "Leia begins to sink into the trash.",
    "Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio,",
    "will you come in?",
    "Threepio!",
    "Will you shut up and listen to me?",
    "Shut down all garbage mashers on the",
    "detention level, will you? Do you",
    "copy?",
    "Shut down all the garbage mashers on",
    "the detention level.",
    "Shut down all the garbage mashers on",
    "the detention level.",
    "Threepio, we're all right!",
    "We're all right. You did great.",
    "Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a",
    "number.",
    "Hey... hey, open the pressure",
    "maintenance hatch on unit number...",
    "where are we?",
    "Well, let's get moving!",
    "Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage",
    "room, as he runs away and then stops howling.",
    "See-Threepio, do you copy?",
    "We're right above you. Stand by.",
    "Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of",
    "the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and",
    "points out the window to the ship.",
    "Where are you going? Come back!",
    "Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.",
    "What good will it do us if he gets",
    "himself killed? Come on!",
    "Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for",
    "muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke",
    "and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.",
    "I think we took a wrong turn.",
    "Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby",
    "reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at",
    "the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch",
    "that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving",
    "them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.",
    "Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.",
    "That oughta hold it for a while.",
    "Oh, I think I just blasted it.",
    "Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the",
    "stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making",
    "ominous drilling and pounding sounds.",
    "Here, hold this.",
    "Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt.",
    "It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge",
    "overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the",
    "rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears",
    "and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.",
    "Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet",
    "of more troops.",
    "Is the ship all right?",
    "Look!",
    "Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader",
    "emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking",
    "bay.",
    "No!",
    "The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.",
    "The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium",
    "Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns",
    "their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and",
    "advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.",
    "I can't believe he's gone.",
    "Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.",
    "They're coming in too fast!",
    "Got him! I got him!",
    "Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully",
    "returns.",
    "That's it! We did it!",
    "The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.",
    "I care!",
    "Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han",
    "stare out at the vast blackness of space.",
    "So... what do you think of her, Han?",
    "Good...",
    "No!",
    "Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at",
    "young Luke's jealousy.",
    "It's not impossible. I used to bull's-",
    "eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back",
    "home. They're not much bigger than",
    "two meters.",
    "So... you got your reward and you're",
    "just leaving then?",
    "Come on! Why don't you take a look",
    "around? You know what's about to",
    "happen, what they're up against.",
    "They could use a good pilot like",
    "you. You're turning your back on",
    "them.",
    "All right. Well, take care of",
    "yourself, Han. I guess that's what",
    "you're best at, isn't it?",
    "Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.",
    "Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really",
    "thought he'd change his mind.",
    "I only wish Ben were here.",
    "Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke",
    "heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs",
    "his arm.",
    "Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there",
    "with you! Listen, have I got some",
    "stories to tell...",
    "Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up",
    "behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born",
    "leader.",
    "Thank you, sir. I'll try.",
    "Red Leader hurries to his own ship.",
    "I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.",
    "Not on your life! That little droid",
    "and I have been through a lot",
    "together.",
    "You okay, Artoo?",
    "The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of",
    "the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps",
    "that he is fine.",
    "Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an",
    "his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive",
    "hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner",
    "into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo",
    "beeps good-bye.",
    "Red Five standing by.",
    "This is Red Five; I'm going in!",
    "I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.",
    "I'm on my way in now...",
    "I'm on it.",
    "My scope's negative. I don't see",
    "anything.",
    "Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.",
    "Got him!",
    "I'm hit, but not bad.",
    "I can't shake him!",
    "Blast it! Wedge where are you?",
    "Thanks, Wedge.",
    "No sign of any... wait!",
    "Coming in point three five.",
    "Red Leader, we're right above you.",
    "Turn to point...",
    "...oh-five; we'll cover for you.",
    "Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.",
    "We're going in. We're going in full",
    "throttle.",
    "It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon",
    "back home.",
    "Watch yourself! Increase speed full",
    "throttle!",
    "You worry about those fighters! I'll",
    "worry about the tower!",
    "Artoo... that, that stabilizer's",
    "broken loose again! See if you can't",
    "lock it down!",
    "Get clear, Wedge.",
    "You can't do any more good back there!",
    "Artoo, try and increase the power!",
    "Nothing. I'm all right.",
    "I've lost Artoo!",
    "Artoo's beeping sounds die out.",
    "I knew you'd come back! I just knew",
    "it!",
    "Oh, no!",
    "The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the",
    "fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.",
    "He'll be all right.",
    "Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han,",
    "old buddy, do you read me?",
    "After a little static a familiar voice is heard.",
    "Well, I finished my circle.  I",
    "don't pick up any life readings.",
    "Right.  I'll see you shortly.",
    "There's a meteorite that hit the",
    "ground near here.  I want to check",
    "it out.  It won't take long.",
    "Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.",
    "He pats the beast on the head to calm it.",
    "Hey, steady girl.  What's the",
    "matter?  You smell something?",
    "Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when",
    "suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a",
    "monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over",
    "him.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.",
    "Aaargh!",
    "Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white",
    "claw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified",
    "screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck",
    "being broken.",
    "The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away",
    "across the frozen plain.",
    "Ben?",
    "Dagobah system?",
    "Ben... Ben.",
    "Luke drops into unconsciousness.",
    "Han pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered",
    "friend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low,",
    "pitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him",
    "urgently.",
    "Ben... Ben...",
    "Dagobah system...",
    "Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe.  He",
    "quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's",
    "inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.",
    "Dagobah...",
    "Yoda...",
    "Thanks to you.",
    "Well, forget the heavy equipment.",
    "There's plenty of time to get the",
    "smaller modules on the transports.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Chewie, take care of yourself,",
    "okay?",
    "As Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around Luke and",
    "gives him a tight hug.  Han is discussing the lifter with a repair",
    "droid when he sees Luke.",
    "Yeah.",
    "You, too.",
    "Luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on.  After a few steps,",
    "he stops and looks back.  Han glances up and the two exchange a silent",
    "communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things,",
    "all difficult to verbalize.",
    "Just like new, Dack.  How about",
    "you?",
    "(quietly, strapping",
    "in)",
    "I know what you mean.",
    "Echo station Five-Seven.  We're",
    "on our way.",
    "All right, boys, keep tight now.",
    "Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern",
    "delta.  Go now!",
    "All right, I'm coming in.",
    "He turns his speeder and heads directly at one of the walkers, flying",
    "toward its towering legs.  The horizon twists as the speeder banks",
    "between the legs.",
    "Hobbie, you still with me?",
    "That armor's too strong for",
    "blasters.",
    "On the horizon, another walker moves up past Luke's cockpit window,",
    "twisting out of sight as Luke banks and starts another run.",
    "Rogue Group, use your harpoons",
    "and tow cables.  Go for the legs.",
    "It might be our only chance of",
    "stopping them.",
    "All right, stand by, Dack.",
    "Dack is at the gunner's controls.",
    "Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get",
    "ready to fire that tow cable.",
    "Barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, Dack struggles to set up",
    "his harpoon gun.",
    "Luke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming walker.",
    "Laser bolts and flak fill the air, creating a deadly obstacle course",
    "for the tiny craft.",
    "Dack?  Dack!",
    "Dack is lost.  Blood streams down his forehead, which rests on his",
    "smoldering controls.  Out the back window, an Imperial walker recedes",
    "in the distance.",
    "Rogue Three.",
    "Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll",
    "have to make this shot.  I'll cover",
    "for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow",
    "me on the next pass.",
    "Steady, Rogue Two",
    "I see it, Wedge.  Good work.",
    "Rogue Two, are you all right?",
    "We'll set harpoon.  I'll cover for you.",
    "Watch that cross fire, boys.",
    "Stay tight and low.",
    "Hobbie, I've been hit!",
    "Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.",
    "From his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing for",
    "takeoff.",
    "Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going,",
    "we're going.",
    "The canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.",
    "There's nothing wrong, Artoo.",
    "I'm just setting a new course.",
    "Artoo beeps once again.",
    "We're not going to regroup with",
    "the others.",
    "Artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, \"What?!\"",
    "Luke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel.",
    "We're going to the Dagobah system.",
    "Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments.  He rides along",
    "with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence.",
    "Finally, Artoo chirps up.",
    "Yes, Artoo?",
    "Artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.",
    "That's all right.  I'd like to",
    "keep it on manual control for a",
    "while.",
    "The little droid lets out a defeated whimper.  Luke smiles, and",
    "continues on his course.",
    "Yes, that's it.  Dagobah.",
    "Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.",
    "No, I'm not going to change my",
    "mind about this.",
    "I'm not picking up any cities or",
    "technology.  Massive life-form",
    "readings, though.  There's something",
    "alive down there...",
    "Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.",
    "Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe",
    "for droids.",
    "I know, I know!  All the scopes are",
    "dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just",
    "hang on, I'm going to start the",
    "landing cycle...",
    "The blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's",
    "electronic squeals.  Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs",
    "were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the",
    "spacecraft stops.  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.",
    "No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll",
    "have a look around.",
    "Artoo lets out a short beep.  As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses",
    "his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.",
    "Artoo?",
    "Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water",
    "is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.",
    "Artoo!  Where are you?",
    "A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is",
    "heard.  The periscope starts to move to shore.  Relieved, Luke starts",
    "running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.",
    "Artoo!  You be more careful.",
    "The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.",
    "Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and",
    "turns to look for Artoo.  The periscope still steadily moves toward",
    "shore.",
    "Artoo - that way!",
    "Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving",
    "toward the little droid.  The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the",
    "swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.  The",
    "droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.",
    "Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into",
    "the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.",
    "Artoo!",
    "The black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin",
    "to appear.  Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the",
    "water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of",
    "soft gray moss.",
    "Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come",
    "on.  You're lucky you don't taste",
    "very good.  Anything broken?",
    "Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from",
    "his round metal body.  Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.",
    "If you're saying coming here was",
    "a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree",
    "with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we",
    "doing here?  It's like... something",
    "out of a dream, or, I don't know.",
    "Maybe I'm just going crazy.",
    "As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him,",
    "Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.",
    "Ready for some power?  Okay.",
    "Let's see now.  Put that in",
    "there.  There you go.",
    "The droid whistles his appreciation.  Luke then opens a container of",
    "processed food and sits before the thermal heater.",
    "Now all I have to do is find this",
    "Yoda... if he even exists.",
    "Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.",
    "Still... there's something familiar",
    "about this place.  I feel like...",
    "I don't know...",
    "(looking at the",
    "creature)",
    "Like we're being watched!",
    "I'm looking for someone.",
    "(Trying to keep from",
    "smiling)",
    "Right.",
    "I don't think so.  I'm looking",
    "for a great warrior.",
    "Put that down.  Hey!  That's my",
    "dinner!",
    "The creature spits out the bite he has taken.  He makes a face.",
    "Listen, friend, we didn't mean to",
    "land in that puddle, and if we",
    "could get our ship out, we would,",
    "but we can't, so why don't you just...",
    "Hey, you could have broken this.",
    "Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're",
    "making a mess.  Hey, give me that!",
    "I don't want your help.  I want",
    "my lamp back.  I'll need it to",
    "get out of this slimy mudhole.",
    "Oh, Artoo, let him have it!",
    "Artoo!",
    "Now will you move along, little",
    "fella?  We're got a lot of work",
    "to do.",
    "I'm not looking for a friend.",
    "I'm looking for a Jedi Master.",
    "You know him?",
    "Stay here and watch after the",
    "camp, Artoo.",
    "Artoo beeps even more frantically.  But as Luke disappears from view,",
    "the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic",
    "sigh.",
    "Look, I'm sure it's delicious.",
    "I just don't understand why we",
    "can't see Yoda now.",
    "How far away is Yoda?  Will it",
    "take us long to get there?",
    "Mostly because of my father, I",
    "guess.",
    "Oh, come on.  How could you know",
    "my father?  You don't even know",
    "who I am.",
    "Oh, I don't know what I'm doing",
    "here.  We're wasting our time.",
    "The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.",
    "Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I",
    "can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm",
    "ready.",
    "Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low",
    "ceiling.",
    "But I've learned so much.",
    "Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge",
    "eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned.  After a",
    "long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.",
    "I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.",
    "Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?",
    "But how am I to know the good side",
    "from the bad?",
    "But tell me why I can't...",
    "There's something not right here.",
    "Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.",
    "I feel cold, death.",
    "What's in there?",
    "Oh, no.  We'll never get it out",
    "now.",
    "Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.",
    "Master, moving stones around is",
    "one thing.  This is totally",
    "different.",
    "All right, I'll give it a try.",
    "I can't.  It's too big.",
    "You want the impossible.",
    "Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter.  With his eyes closed and",
    "his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.",
    "Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo",
    "beeps in terror and scoots away.",

    "LUKE\t (pointing to the controls)",
    "Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!",
    "Luke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely",
    "avoiding two huge trees.",
    "Move closer!",
    "Leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer",

    "slowing the scout.",
    "Get alongside that one!",
    "Leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their",
    "steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of",
    "the scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him",
    "off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike",
    "and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the",
    "remaining scout.",
    "Get him!",
    "The speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing",
    "into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser",

    "LUKE\t (indicating the one ahead)",
    "Keep on that one! I'll take these two!",
    "With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into",
    "the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as",
    "they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and",
    "starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a",
    "manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted",
    "out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.",
    "The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into",
    "turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.",
    "FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom",
    "through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and",
    "rises out of sight.",
    "The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia",
    "dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes",
    "a glancing hit.",
    "Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches",
    "down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has",
    "blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike",
    "explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion.",
    "But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a",
    "giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a",
    "conflagration.",
    "ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue",
    "their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The",
    "scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a",
    "bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top",
    "and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a",
    "wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside",
    "him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all",
    "his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able",
    "to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the",
    "scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are",
    "moving as one.",
    "Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and",
    "dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's",
    "explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find",
    "Luke.",
    "Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and",
    "opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and",
    "begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it",
    "appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant,",
    "Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty",
    "slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling,",
    "it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.",
    "We got separated.",
    "Luke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.",
    "Hey, we better go look for her.",
    "Han nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.",
    "Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.",
    "Luke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the",
    "squad proceeds in another.",
    "There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.",
    "He tosses the helmet to Han.",

    "Too late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake.",
    "SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net,",
    "suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of",
    "beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a",
    "jumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.",
    "Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this",

    "Han, can you reach my lightsaber?",
    "Han, don't. It'll be all right.",

    "them take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.",
    "Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.",
    "Artoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free",
    "of the net and sits up, rattled.",
    "Do you understand anything they're saying?",
    "Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry",
    "and use your magic.",
    "Just tell them.",
    "Threepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps",

    "There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I",
    "don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.",
    "Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.",
    "You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to",
    "use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has",

    "I'm not gonna hurt you.",
    "Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of",

    "Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here",
    "is.",
    "She puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from",
    "her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log",
    "beside her.",
    "Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.",

    "That's right. Come on. Hmmm?",
    "Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the",
    "log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps",
    "back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her",
    "and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.",
    "Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery",
    "little thing, aren't you?",
    "Reassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming",
    "to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to",

    "to Leia.",
    "What is it?",
    "Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log",
    "next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding",
    "behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears",
    "underneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the",
    "forest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL",
    "SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches",
    "out his hand for her weapon.",

    "Freeze!  Come on, get up!",

    "SCOUT #2",
    "Yes, sir.",

    "jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled.",
    "Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol,",
    "and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and",
    "hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's",
    "bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once",
    "more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards",
    "Leia with\ufffdnew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking",
    "around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the",
    "dense foliage.",
    "Come on, let's get outta here.",
    "As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and",

    "That was no laser blast!  Something",
    "hit us.",
    "Come on, Chewie!",
    "Han climbs out of the hold like a shot.  Both he and Chewie run out of",
    "the hold and toward the cockpit.",
    "Oh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-",
    "one.",
    "They'd be crazy to follow us,",
    "wouldn't they?",
    "Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt.",
    "Never tell me the odds!",
    "You said you wanted to be around",
    "when I made a mistake; well, this",
    "could be it, sweetheart.",
    "I'm not going to argue with that.",
    "I'm going in closer to one of",
    "those big ones.",
    "There.  That looks pretty good.",
    "Yeah.  That'll do nicely.",
    "Yeah, me too.",
    "I'm going to shut down everything",
    "but the emergency power systems.",
    "No, I need you to talk to the",
    "Falcon, find out what's wrong with",
    "the hyperdrive.",
    "Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit",
    "to go flying.  Chewie howls.",
    "Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're",
    "here to tell us these things.  Chewie,",
    "take the professor in the back and",
    "plug him into the hyperdrive.",
    "Sshh!",
    "Don't get excited.",
    "The anger rises in Leia.",
    "Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't",
    "got time for anything else.",
    "Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the",
    "door.  Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.",
    "Well, of course I'll have to replace",
    "it.",
    "He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.",
    "Here!  And Chewie...",
    "Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and",
    "whines.  Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so",
    "only he can hear.",
    "... I think we'd better replace",
    "the negative power coupling.",
    "Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts",
    "to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve.  It",
    "doesn't budge.  Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her.  She",
    "rebuffs him.",
    "Hey, Your Worship, I'm only",
    "trying to help.",
    "Sure, Leia.",
    "I do, I really do.  You could be",
    "a little nicer, though.",
    "(he watches her",
    "reaction)",
    "Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you",
    "think I'm all right.",
    "She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.",
    "Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like",
    "the sound of that.",
    "With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.",
    "Stop what?",
    "Leia is flushes, confused.",
    "My hands are dirty, too.  What",
    "are you afraid of?",
    "You're trembling.",
    "You like me because I'm a scoundrel.",
    "There aren't enough scoundrels in",
    "your life.",
    "Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an",
    "excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.",
    "I'm a nice man.",
    "Thank you.  Thank you very much.",
    "I'm not really interested in your",
    "opinion, Threepio.",
    "Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into",
    "place.",
    "Where?",
    "I'm going out there.",
    "I just got this bucket back",
    "together.  I'm not going to let",
    "something tear it apart.",
    "He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out.  Leia",
    "follows.",
    "There's an awful lot of moisture",
    "in here.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's",
    "cockpit.  A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of",
    "the Falcon.  The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it",
    "with a laser bolt.",
    "Watch out!",
    "The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front",
    "of the princess.  Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.",
    "Yeah, that's what I thought.",
    "Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest",
    "of the ship, make sure there",
    "aren't any more attached.  They're",
    "chewing on the power cables.",
    "Go on inside.  We'll clean them",
    "off if there are any more.",
    "Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air.  Leia",
    "puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the",
    "ship.  Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster.  Several of",
    "the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit",
    "window of the Falcon.  Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.",
    "Wait a minute...",
    "He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.",
    "The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.",
    "Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han.",
    "The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their",
    "faces and run up the platform.",
    "All right, Chewie, let's get",
    "out of here!",
    "The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes",
    "to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel.  Leia",
    "hurries after.",
    "No time to discuss this in",
    "committee.",
    "And with that he is gone.  The main engines of the Falcon begin to",
    "whine.  Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.",
    "Sit down, sweetheart.  We're",
    "taking off!",
    "As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks.  He notices something",
    "out the window ahead.  Threepio sees it too.",
    "I see it, I see it.",
    "Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen",
    "surrounding the entrance.  And as the Falcon moves forward, the",
    "entrance to the cave grows ever smaller.  Han pulls hard on the",
    "throttle, sending his ship surging forward.",
    "This is no cave.",
    "Let's get out of here.  Ready for",
    "light-speed?  One... two... three!",
    "Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens.  Flak",
    "bursts continue to rock the ship.",
    "It's not fair!",
    "Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and",
    "captain.  Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.",
    "The transfer circuits are working.",
    "It's not my fault!",
    "Chewie puts his head in his hands, whining.",
    "It's not my fault.",
    "Turn her around.",
    "Chewie barks in puzzlement.",
    "I said turn her around!  I'm",
    "going to put all power in the",
    "front shield.",
    "The fleet is beginning to break",
    "up.  Go back and stand by the",
    "manual release for the landing claw.",
    "Chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Well, if they follow standard",
    "Imperial procedure, they'll dump",
    "their garbage before they go to",
    "light-speed, then we just float",
    "away.",
    "Then we've got to find a safe",
    "port somewhere around here.  Got",
    "any ideas?",
    "The Anoat system.",
    "No.  Well, wait.  This is",
    "interesting.  Lando.",
    "He points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel.  Leia slips out",
    "of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot.  Small light points",
    "representing several systems flash by on the computer screen.",
    "Lando's not a system, he's a man.",
    "Lando Calrissian.  He's a card",
    "player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd",
    "like him.",
    "Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I",
    "think we can make it.",
    "Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando",
    "conned somebody out of it.  We",
    "go back a long way, Lando and me.",
    "No.  But he has no love for the",
    "Empire, I can tell you that.",
    "Chewie barks over the intercom.  Han quickly changes his readouts and",
    "stretches to look out the cockpit window.",
    "Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by.",
    "Detach!",
    "Han leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile.  She",
    "thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and",
    "she gives him a quick kiss.",
    "No, I don't have a landing",
    "permit.  I'm trying to reach",
    "Lando Calrissian.",
    "More flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ship's",
    "interior.  Leia looks worried.",
    "Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me",
    "explain.",
    "Well, that was a long time ago.",
    "I'm sure he's forgotten about",
    "that.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Angry, Han snaps off the intercom.  Chewie looks at him and grunts.",
    "Han turns to the worried princess and her droid.",
    "There's nothing to worry about.",
    "We go way back, Lando and me.",
    "Leia doesn't look convinced.",
    "Well, what would you like?",
    "Look, don't worry.  Everything's",
    "going to be fine.  Trust me.",
    "See?  My friend.",
    "Keep your eyes open, okay?",
    "Chewie growls as Han walks down the ramp.  Lando and his men head",
    "across the bridge to meet the space pirate.",
    "(gestures toward",
    "the Falcon)",
    "Ahh... repairs.  I thought you",
    "could help me out.",
    "Your ship?  Hey, remember, you",
    "lost her to me fair and square.",
    "Chewie growls a reserved greeting.  Lando suddenly notices the princess",
    "and smiles.",
    "All right, all right, you old",
    "smoothie.",
    "Han takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando.",
    "Hyperdrive.",
    "Good.",
    "Lando turns to Leia.",
    "How's the gas mine?  Is it",
    "paying off for you?",
    "You.  Listen to you - you sound",
    "like a businessman, a responsible",
    "leader.  Who'd have thought that,",
    "huh?",
    "Lando is reflective.  He looks at Han a moment.",
    "Yeah.",
    "The ship is almost finished.",
    "Two or Three more things and",
    "we're in great shape.",
    "Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and",
    "see what I can find out.",
    "Well, I don't trust him, either.",
    "But he is my friend.  Besides,",
    "we'll soon be gone.",
    "Where?  Found him in a junk pile?",
    "Lando's got people who can fix",
    "him.",
    "No.  No problem.  Why?",
    "Han and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and",
    "Chewie.  The door slides closed behind them.",
    "Aren't you afraid the Empire's",
    "going to find out about this",
    "little operation and shut you down?",
    "I'm sorry, too.",
    "I feel terrible.",
    "Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open",
    "revealing Leia.  She, too, looks a little worse for wear.  The troopers",
    "push her into the cell, and the door slides closed.  She moves to Han,",
    "who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking",
    "his head.",
    "They never even asked me any",
    "questions.",
    "The cell door slides open.  Lando and two of his guards enter.",
    "Get out of here, Lando!",
    "Over to you?",
    "Luke?",
    "Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty",
    "good, didn't you?",
    "My friend!",
    "Han hauls off and punches Lando.  The two friends are instantly engaged",
    "in a frantic close-quarters fight.  The guards hit Han with their rifle",
    "butts and he flies across the room.  Chewie growls and starts for the",
    "guards.  They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando",
    "stops them.",
    "Yeah, you're a real hero.",
    "Lando and the guards leave.  Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia",
    "and Chewie help him up.",
    "What's going on... buddy?",
    "Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear",
    "me?  Stop!",
    "Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help",
    "me.  Hey!",
    "Han gives the Wookiee a stern look.",
    "Save your strength.  There'll be",
    "another time.  The princess - you",
    "have to take care of her.  You",
    "hear me?",
    "Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.",
    "In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too",
    "distraught to protest.  Han turns to Princess Leia.  They look",
    "sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a",
    "final, passionate kiss.",
    "I know.",
    "Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to",
    "the hydraulic platform.  Han looks one final time at his friends - and",
    "then, suddenly, the platform drops.  Chewie howls.  Leia turns away in",
    "agony.",
    "Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.",
    "Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and",
    "fluid as great as any steel furnace.  Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns",
    "away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.",
    "I can't see.",
    "Where am I?",
    "Who are you?",
    "The bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head,",
    "revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.",
    "Leia!",
    "What's that? I know that laugh.",
    "The curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the",
    "Hutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his",
    "gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.",
    "Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I",
    "got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.",
    "Jabba laughs.",
    "JABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)",
    "It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but",
    "now you're Bantha fodder.",
    "Look...",
    "JABBA\t (cont Huttese subtitled)",
    "Take him away!",
    "The guards grab Han and start to lead him away.",
    "Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here.",
    "Don't be a fool!",
    "Han is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead",
    "Leia away.",
    "JABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)",
    "Bring her to me.",
    "Jabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young",
    "princess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly",
    "turns away in disgust.",
    "Chewie? Chewie, is that you?",
    "The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting",
    "him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light,",
    "revealing Chewie.",
    "Ah! Chew--Chewie!",
    "The giant Wookiee barks with glee.",
    "Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?",
    "Chewie barks an excited blue streak.",
    "Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less",
    "rescue anybody.",
    "Chewie barks a reply.",
    "A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets",
    "delusions of grandeur.",
    "Chewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.",
    "I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.",
    "Luke!",
    "Fine. Together again, huh?",
    "How are we doing?",
    "That bad, huh? Where's Leia?",
    "Luke looks to Leia.",
    "Good, I hate long waits.",
    "On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?",
    "Chewie barks his agreement.",
    "I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a",
    "big light blur.",
    "You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.",
    "Oh... great!",
    "Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get",
    "no such pleasure from us. Right?",
    "Chewie growls his agreement.",
    "Chewie, you okay? Where is he?",
    "The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.",
    "I'm okay, pal.",
    "For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a",
    "cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong",
    "cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from",
    "the wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight",
    "up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable",
    "and stands free.",
    "Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is",
    "knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.",
    "Lando!",
    "Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets",
    "him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves",
    "in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young",
    "Jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating",
    "the guards from their midst.",
    "Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han,",
    "guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards.",
    "Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold",
    "of the spear.",
    "Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the",
    "other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his",
    "arm, and aims his lethal appendage.",
    "Chewie barks desperately at Han.",
    "Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?",
    "The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand",
    "whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.",
    "The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts",
    "off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the",
    "side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams",
    "as his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into",
    "the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a",
    "weak congratulations to Han.",
    "Lando, grab it!",
    "I'm trying!",
    "A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han",
    "and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks,",
    "and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot",
    "catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit.",
    "The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit",
    "from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.",
    "Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.",
    "Chewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han",
    "extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the",
    "pit.",
    "Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!",
    "Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck",
    "gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the",
    "skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail",
    "Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up",
    "the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his",
    "head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks",
    "the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.",
    "The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who",
    "is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron",
    "has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by",
    "lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand",
    "moves him closer to his final reward.",
    "Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!",
    "Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let",
    "go of the spear.",
    "Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.",
    "Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly",
    "around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.",
    "Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.",
    "It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.",
    "Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!",
    "I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!",
    "No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest",
    "thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide",
    "awake nothing!",
    "Luke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior,",
    "mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.",
    "LUKE \t(moving to his ship)",
    "I'll see you back at the fleet.",
    "Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?",
    "(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's",
    "betrayal and subsequent aide)",
    "Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.",
    "Well, look at you, a general, huh?",
    "Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable",
    "one, remember?",
    "Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.",
    "Good luck.",
    "Lando nods his thanks.",
    "You're gonna need it.",
    "Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.",
    "Chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him.",
    "Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.",
    "Chewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.",
    "HAN\t (smiles)",
    "That's one.",
    "Luke.",
    "Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the",
    "help you can get. She's",
    "the fastest ship in the fleet.",
    "You, too.",
    "Han goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.",
    "You got her warmed?",
    "No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed",
    "her, Chewie.",
    "Leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.",
    "Chewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on",
    "something out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him",
    "gently.",
    "Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.",
    "Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the",
    "Falcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.",
    "LEIA\t (softly)",
    "Come on, General, let's move.",
    "Han snaps back to life.",
    "Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready,",
    "everybody?",
    "All right, hang on.",
    "If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty",
    "quick, Chewie.",
    "Chewie growls his agreement.",
    "CONTROLLER\t (over radio)",
    "We have you on our screen now. Please identify.",

    "CONTROLLER\t (over radio)",
    "Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.",
    "Transmission commencing.",
    "Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed",
    "transmission begins.",
    "It'll work. It'll work.",
    "Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer",
    "that looms ever larger before them.",
    "Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep",
    "your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep",
    "your distance.",
    "Chewie barks a question.",
    "I don't know.  Fly casual.",
    "It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.",
    "Chewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out",
    "the window.",

    "Hm?  Mmmm.",

    "And well you should not.  For my",
    "ally in the Force.  And a powerful",
