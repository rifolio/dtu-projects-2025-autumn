== History ==

=== Early years (2002–2004) ===

Early on, [[Lacey Sturm]] performed with James Culpepper. Guitarists Jared Hartmann and Sameer Bhattacharya were later recruited. "Sameer and Jared are really experimental with melodies and [[Effects pedal|pedals]]," said Sturm, "and we all had different influences that were all blending together with the same passionate and hopeful heart, and that brought out this beautiful feeling. It was magical."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flyleafonline.com/media/interviews.php |title=The latest news, information, tour dates, pictures, mp3s, videos, lyrics and more |publisher=Flyleaf Online |access-date=2016-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222103201/http://flyleafonline.com/media/interviews.php |archive-date=February 22, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Bassist Pat Seals joined after leaving his previous band, The Grove.

As Passerby, the band released three EPs and played over 100 shows in Texas alone over the span of two years under the booking and promotion company Runt Entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In 2004, Passerby played a showcase for [[RCA Records]] in New York City in hopes of getting signed. RCA passed on the band, but the president of [[A&M/Octone Records|Octone Records]] was very interested. They waited for two days in their van at a truck stop for a phone call about an Octone showcase. They were signed after the showcase, and on January 7, 2004, Octone Records' website announced their arrival to the label.

In March 2004, Passerby traveled to [[Seattle]], Washington, to record an EP with producer Rick Parashar. Afterwards, they toured with [[Skillet (band)|Skillet]], [[Breaking Benjamin]], [[Staind]], and [[3 Doors Down]] to promote their self-titled EP. For legal reasons, they renamed themselves ''Flyleaf'' in June 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flyleafonline.com/band/FAQ.php |title=The latest news, information, tour dates, pictures, mp3s, videos, lyrics and more |publisher=Flyleaf Online |access-date=2016-08-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125325/http://flyleafonline.com/band/FAQ.php |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In October, the EP was released to stores (as ''Flyleaf''), spawning their first official single and video for the EP version of "Breathe Today".

=== Debut album (2005–2008) ===

In 2005, the band recorded their first full-length album with [[Howard Benson]]. On October 4, 2005, the record was released under the title ''[[Flyleaf (album)|Flyleaf]]''. Appearances on the album include [[Dave Navarro]] of [[Jane's Addiction]] and Ryan White of Resident Hero. The first mainstream single from their debut album was "[[I'm So Sick]]", "[[Fully Alive]]" was the second, "[[All Around Me]]" was the third, and "Sorrow" was the fourth.

In the summer of 2006, the band played on the mainstage of the [[Family Values Tour 2006]], and in late 2006, Flyleaf toured with [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], [[Stone Sour]] and [[Nonpoint]] on the [[Music as a Weapon Tour|Music as a Weapon III Tour]]. The band issued an exclusive EP, which was sold at the tour called ''[[Music as a Weapon EP]]'' which features an acoustic version of "Fully Alive", and three previously unreleased tracks: "Much Like Falling", "Justice And Mercy", and "Christmas Song" (''Much Like Falling'' and ''Justice and Mercy'' later appeared on [[Much Like Falling EP]]). A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the EP went to [[World Vision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revenantmedia.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=933&Itemid=17 |title=Revenant Media |publisher=Revenant Media |access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref>

In 2007 Flyleaf toured with [[Three Days Grace]] and throughout Australia with the [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave festival]], and also toured Europe with [[Stone Sour]] and Forever Never. In the spring of 2007, Flyleaf headlined their Justice & Mercy Tour which first featured Skillet and [[Dropping Daylight]]. Later on they did a second leg of the tour which featured [[Sick Puppies]], [[Kill Hannah]] and Resident Hero. Flyleaf again joined the [[Family Values Tour]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.familyvalueslive.com/ |title=Family Values Tour 2007 - Official Site |access-date=2007-10-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024155719/http://www.familyvalueslive.com/ |archive-date=October 24, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> The music video for "I'm So Sick" appeared briefly in the 2007 film ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]''. Also a remix of the song "I'm So Sick" is on the Soundtrack to the movie ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]''. "[[Perfect (Flyleaf song)|Perfect]]" was also released as a single in late 2007 to Christian radio stations. Released on November 5, 2007, ''[[The Sims 2]]'' expansion pack ''[[The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff|Teen Style Stuff]]'' featured the band's song "Cassie" recorded in Simlish.

Flyleaf also released a song entitled "Tina" which was the first song that they debuted in the release of ''[[Guitar Hero 3]]'' as part of the Companion Disk Set. Also, the song "I'm So Sick" appears in ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]''.
On October 30, Flyleaf also released a digital EP titled Much Like Falling EP. The songs included on this EP were "Much Like Falling", an acoustic version of "Supernatural", the limited release song "Tina", and The EP is available on [[iTunes]] along with the expanded edition of their debut album.

On April 26, 2008, the band released their fourth video, "Sorrow", from their debut album on [[MTV2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyleafonline.com/?cat=1|title=The latest news, information, tour dates, pictures, mp3s, videos, lyrics and more|publisher=Flyleaf Online|access-date=2016-08-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218041831/http://flyleafonline.com/?cat=1|archive-date=February 18, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The band toured with [[Seether]] in late spring but had to cancel five shows due to a problem with Sturm's voice. The members of Flyleaf took the fall off to write new music, hoping to begin recording by January.

Flyleaf also contributed a cover of the song, "What's This?" from ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' soundtrack for its cover album, ''[[Nightmare Revisited]]''.

=== ''Memento Mori'' (2009–2010) ===

When Flyleaf finished recording their second album, they had selected 14 songs out of the 30 already written. Some of these songs, such as "[[Again (Flyleaf song)|Again]]", "Have We Lost", and "Beautiful Bride", have been performed live. The band reunited with producer Howard Benson and enlisted the mixing services of [[Chris Lord-Alge]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/memento-mori-r1663608/credits |title=Memento Mori - Flyleaf |publisher=AllMusic |date=November 10, 2009 |access-date=October 21, 2011}}</ref> It was released on November 10, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=Platinum Rock Band Flyleaf Builds Momentum with Release of ''Memento Mori'' |work= JesusFreakHideout |date=August 17, 2009 |url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/news/2009/08/17.PLATINUM%20ROCK%20BAND%20FLYLEAF%20BUILDS%20MOMENTUM%20WITH%20RELEASE%20OF%20MEMENTO%20MORI%20OCT.%2027.asp}}</ref> The album, titled ''[[Memento Mori (Flyleaf album)|Memento Mori]],'' features songs such as "Beautiful Bride", "Arise", "Missing", "Again" and "Set Apart This Dream", which was inspired by the Christian book ''[[Wild at Heart (Eldredge book)|Wild at Heart]]''.<ref name="rollingstonenewalbum">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/26796187/spring_music_preview_julyaugust |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323160834/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/26796187/spring_music_preview_julyaugust |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 23, 2009 |title=News |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref> Flyleaf debuted an additional two songs live during a small acoustic tour the band did in Afghanistan for United States Armed Forces called "Chasm" and "Circle".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvidshub.net/?script=news/news_show.php&id=36140 |title=Texas Band Flyleaf Delivers High Spirits to Troops Overseas |publisher=Dvidshub.net |access-date=October 21, 2011}}</ref>

The group, starting in Seattle, Washington, on September 28, 2009, held VIP listening parties throughout the country inviting fans to be the first to hear a selection of songs from the new record and view brand new music videos before they aired nationwide. By partnering with Eventful, fans were given the opportunity to demand that their city get routed into the "Road to Memento Mori" using Eventful's "Demand It!" service.

Based on overwhelming demand there were over 10 events. Fans saw Sturm, Sameer Bhattacharya, and Jared Hartmann, who made special appearances at these intimate gatherings across the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=127554 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - FLYLEAF: 'Memento Mori' Listening Parties Announced |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=October 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201232613/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=127554 |archive-date=December 1, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On November 2, 2009, the band released a short [[Webisode]] for their new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34338/exclusive-premiere-flyleaf-memento-mori-webisode |title=Exclusive Premiere: Flyleaf Memento Mori Webisode |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date=November 2, 2009 |access-date=October 21, 2011}}</ref>

Flyleaf's other video, "Beautiful Bride," was shot in early August 2009 by director Don Tyler. The video was originally released at the ''Memento Mori'' listening events, but was later featured on [[Yahoo!]] the day ''Memento Mori'' came out. The video features James' sister/Sameer's wife, April, as the bride and Joshua Sturm, Lacey's husband, as the groom. Like "Again," this video features Pat's artwork throughout the video. Future singles are set to include "Chasm" for rock stations and "Missing" for alternative.

Flyleaf toured throughout the United States with [[Breaking Benjamin]] and [[Three Days Grace]] from January to March 2010. They embarked on a headlining tour called the "Unite & Fight Tour" with [[10 Years (band)|10 Years]] and [[Fair to Midland]]. The tour began on April 28, 2010, and ended on June 6, 2010. The band attended the Muz-TV Award 2010 awards (Премия МУЗ-ТВ) in Russia and performed the songs "I'm So Sick", "Again" and "All Around Me". They are one of many bands that performed at Download Festival on June 12, 2010. The band encouraged fans to donate to stop human trafficking in other countries.

The band was scheduled to continue with the second leg of the "Unite & Fight" tour from September 10, 2010, to October 23, 2010, with [[Story of the Year]], and performed at various festivals through the end of the year.

At the end of the Unite and Fight tour in early November, Lacey collaborated with band Apocalyptica on the song "Broken Pieces", as well as with Australian singer [[Orianthi]] in her new song "Courage".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flyleafonline.com/2010/10/27/orianthi-feat-lacey-courage-video/ |title=The latest news, information, tour dates, pictures, mp3s, videos, lyrics and more |publisher=Flyleaf Online |date=October 27, 2010 |access-date=October 21, 2011 |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728032738/http://flyleafonline.com/2010/10/27/orianthi-feat-lacey-courage-video/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Soon after they released "Arise" as the next single from ''Memento Mori''.

On November 6, 2010, the band performed at Rock the Hood, a festival at [[Fort Hood]] in memory of all the soldiers who have died, especially the 13 who died at the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting|November 2009 shooting]].

=== May's departure and hiatus (2016–2022) ===
On August 15, 2016, lead vocalist Kristen May announced her departure from the band, citing a growing desire to stay at home with her family and that she never really felt as if she was part of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/iamKristenMay/videos/1071009566300953/|title=Kristen May - Timeline |website=[[Facebook]] |access-date=October 3, 2016}}</ref>

Following May's departure, the band went on hiatus. The remaining members went on to pursue other interests.

=== Sturm's return (2022–present) ===
In 2021, the band's social media accounts were reactivated after being inactive since the band's hiatus. In November 2022, the band began teasing their return, including releasing band photos with their original lead singer, Lacey Sturm. On November 7, 2022, the band's profile pictures on their social media accounts changed to feature the phrase ''Flyleaf with Lacey Sturm''.<ref name="flyleaflacey">{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/flyleaf-appears-to-have-reunited-with-singer-lacey-sturm|title=Flyleaf Appears To Have Reunited With Singer Lacey Sturm|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=November 7, 2022|access-date=November 7, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://wcyy.com/flyleaf-reunite-with-lacey-sturm/|title=It Looks Like Flyleaf Have Reunited With Lacey Sturm|website=[[WCYY]]|date=November 7, 2022|access-date=November 7, 2022}}</ref> On December 6, 2024, the band began offering pre-orders for the first vinyl pressing of their self-titled album, to be released in 2025, 20 years after the album's original release.{{citation needed|date=March 2025}}

== Christianity ==

Lead vocalist Lacey Sturm is a Christian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ransom.tv/notes/lacey-sturm|title=Lacey Sturm|work=Ransom|access-date=October 5, 2014|archive-date=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006204319/http://www.ransom.tv/notes/lacey-sturm/|url-status=dead}}</ref> While faith has influenced the band's music, Sturm said that she does not believe that necessarily makes Flyleaf strictly a Christian band. The band says they are Christians who play in a rock band, and their faith is heard within their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=7457032&blogID=356095186 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708014919/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=7457032&blogID=356095186 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |title=Lions and tigers and Christian bands, oh my! van Flyleaf op Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |date=February 9, 2008 |access-date=October 21, 2011 }}</ref> "We all share the same faith."

In November 2006, Flyleaf performed a free concert at [[Los Angeles Pierce College]] for a Christian group called The Revolt, which was a three-day event. The band performed a half-hour set Thursday night. It was The Revolt's opening night at Pierce College and the first time the campus has been used as an outdoor music venue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theroundupnews.com/2006/11/17/positive-message-rocks-youthbr |title=Flyleaf Round Up |publisher=Roundupnews.com |date=November 17, 2006 |access-date=October 28, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107114531/http://theroundupnews.com/2006/11/17/positive-message-rocks-youthbr/ |archive-date=November 7, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In a May 2010 interview, Sturm was asked how it felt to be in a Christian rock band and play in Las Vegas: <blockquote>Well, you know what? I don't know what you mean by a "Christian rock band." It's hard to say that because people all have a different definition of what that means. If it means that we're Christians, then yeah, we're Christians, but if a plumber's a Christian, does that make him a "Christian plumber?" I mean we're not playing for Christians. We're just playing honestly and that's going to come out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlanticcityweekly.com/arts-and-entertainment/Flyleaf-is-Mindful-of-Death-94283274.html |title=Flyleaf Is Mindful of Death |author=Jeff Schwachter |date=May 19, 2010 |publisher=Atlanticcityweekly.com |access-date=October 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909011136/http://www.atlanticcityweekly.com/arts-and-entertainment/Flyleaf-is-Mindful-of-Death-94283274.html |archive-date=September 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>

Former lead vocalist May has felt the band's fans believe she's "not Christian enough" despite professing to be a Christian. She also hopes that people do not discount the band by using the "Christian" label. But despite all this, they're still considered a Christian band in rock world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crypticrock.com/kristen-may-flyleaf-interview |title= Interview: Kristen May of Flyleaf Cryptic Rock |publisher=Crypticrock.com |date=July 12, 2013 |access-date=September 27, 2013}}</ref>

Although the band relies on themes transcending many faiths and ways of life, they insist being a Christian will always be a part of them and influence their writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://substreammagazine.com/2014/07/interview-flyleaf-talks-about-their-new-album-at-their-music-video-shoot/|title=INTERVIEW: Flyleaf Talks about Their New Album at their Music Video Shoot|work=Substream Magazine|access-date=October 5, 2014|archive-date=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006072123/http://substreammagazine.com/2014/07/interview-flyleaf-talks-about-their-new-album-at-their-music-video-shoot/|url-status=dead}}</ref>
