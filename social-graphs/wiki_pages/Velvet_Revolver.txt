'''Velvet Revolver''' was an American [[hard rock]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] consisting of [[Guns N' Roses]] members [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] (lead guitar), [[Duff McKagan]] (bass, backing vocals) and [[Matt Sorum]] (drums, backing vocals), alongside [[Dave Kushner]] (rhythm guitar) formerly of [[Hardcore punk|punk]] band [[Wasted Youth (American band)|Wasted Youth]], and [[Scott Weiland]] (lead vocalist) formerly of [[Stone Temple Pilots]].  The band formed in 2002 and was active until 2008, when Weiland was fired from the band and subsequently rejoined Stone Temple Pilots.

In 2004, the band achieved commercial success with their debut album, ''[[Contraband (Velvet Revolver album)|Contraband]]''. Despite positive reviews, some critics initially described Velvet Revolver as a mere combination of Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses, and criticized them for a "disconnection" between Weiland and the rest of the band. With their single "[[Slither (song)|Slither]]", they won the 2005 [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]]. The band released ''[[Libertad (Velvet Revolver album)|Libertad]]'' in 2007, driven by the release of the single "[[She Builds Quick Machines]]", and embarked on a tour with [[Alice in Chains]].

In April 2008, Weiland was fired from Velvet Revolver and [[2008 Stone Temple Pilots Reunion Tour|reunited with Stone Temple Pilots]]. Velvet Revolver was put on indefinite hiatus and in November of that year, requested to be released by their record label [[RCA Records]] to allow themselves "complete freedom to go through whatever process it would take to accomplish" replacing Weiland.

Although Velvet Revolver worked on new material and auditioned new singers following Scott Weiland's departure, the band has not released any new material and only performed publicly once since 2008, when they reunited with Weiland for a one-off reunion show on January 12, 2012, at a benefit concert. This proved to be their last performance together before Weiland's death on December 3, 2015. Slash and McKagan rejoined Guns N' Roses in 2016.

==History==

===Foundations (2001–2002)===
Slash, Duff McKagan, and Matt Sorum were members of the hard rock band [[Guns N' Roses]]. However, disagreements with singer [[Axl Rose]] resulted in Slash leaving the band in 1996 and McKagan departing in 1997 shortly before Sorum was fired.<ref name="Guns N' Roses AMG">{{cite web | author = Thomas Erlewine, Stephen |author2=Prato, Greg | title = Guns N' Roses Biography | publisher = [[AllMusic]] | access-date = November 14, 2010 | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4416/biography|pure_url=yes}} | author-link = Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> Following their departures the trio focused on separate projects, with Slash reforming [[Slash's Snakepit]]<ref name="Slash AMG">{{cite web | last = Huey | first = Steve | title = Slash Biography | publisher = AllMusic | access-date = November 14, 2010 | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=slash-p125919/biography|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref> and McKagan reforming [[10 Minute Warning]]<ref name="Duff McKagan AMG">{{cite web | last = Torreano | first = Bradley | title = Duff McKagan Biography | publisher = AllMusic| access-date = November 14, 2010 | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p104254/biography|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref><ref name="10 Minute Warning AMG">{{cite web | last = Ankeny | first = Jason | title = 10 Minute Warning Biography | publisher = AllMusic| access-date = November 14, 2010 | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p294177/biography|pure_url=yes}}}}</ref> as well as recording his second solo album,<ref name="Duff McKagan AMG"/> while Sorum rejoined [[the Cult]].<ref>{{Cite book | author = Slash | author2 = Bozza, Anthony | author-link2 = Anthony Bozza | title = [[Slash (autobiography)|Slash]] | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2007 | page = [https://archive.org/details/slashautobiograp0000unse/page/397 397] | isbn = 978-0-00-725775-1 }}</ref>

It was prior to a screening of ''The Hulk'' at [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] that the band chose a name. After seeing a movie by [[Revolution Studios]], Slash liked the beginning of the word, eventually thinking of Revolver because of its multiple meanings; the name of a gun, subtext of a revolving door which suited the band as well as the name of a [[Revolver (Beatles album)|Beatles album]]. When he suggested Revolver to the band, Weiland suggested back Black Velvet Revolver, liking the idea of "something intimate like velvet juxtaposed with something deadly like a gun." They eventually arrived at Velvet Revolver, announcing it at a press conference and performance showcase at the [[El Rey Theatre (Los Angeles)|El Rey Theatre]] while also performing the songs "Set Me Free" and "Slither" as well as covers of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[Negative Creep]]", [[Sex Pistols]]' "[[Bodies (Sex Pistols song)|Bodies]]", and Guns N' Roses' "[[It's So Easy (Guns N' Roses song)|It's So Easy]]".<ref name="Slash p.437">{{Cite book|author=Slash| title= Slash|author2=Bozza, Anthony| publisher= HarperCollins|year=2007| isbn= 978-0-00-725775-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/slashautobiograp0000unse/page/437 437]}}</ref>

Prior to the recording of their debut album, Weiland took material that the band had previously written to his studio, Lavish, in [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles|Toluca Lake]]. With engineer [[Doug Grean]], Weiland rearranged the music to fit his vocals, eventually coming out with the songs "Big Machine" and "Dirty Little Thing". The band worked on new material for songs such as "You Got No Right", "Slither", "Sucker Train Blues", and "Do It for the Kids", among others. During this time Weiland was arrested at the parking lot of his studio for [[drug possession]]. Upon release from jail, he wrote lyrics to material he was given previously, writing the lyrics to the song "Fall to Pieces".<ref name="Slash p.438">{{Cite book|author=Slash|title= Slash |author2=Bozza, Anthony|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2007|isbn= 978-0-00-725775-1|page= [https://archive.org/details/slashautobiograp0000unse/page/438 438]}}</ref> Velvet Revolver soon began recording their debut album.
