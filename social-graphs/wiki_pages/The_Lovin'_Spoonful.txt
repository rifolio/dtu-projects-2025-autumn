'''The Lovin' Spoonful''' is a Canadian-American [[folk-rock]] band formed in [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, in 1964. The band were among the most popular groups in the United States for a short period in the mid-1960s and their music and image influenced many of the contemporary rock acts of their era. Beginning in July{{nbsp}}1965 with their debut single "[[Do You Believe in Magic (song)|Do You Believe in Magic]]", the band had seven consecutive singles reach the Top Ten of the US charts in the eighteen months that followed, including the number-two hits "[[Daydream (The Lovin' Spoonful song)|Daydream]]" and "[[Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?]]" and the chart-topping "[[Summer in the City (song)|Summer in the City]]".

Led by their primary songwriter [[John Sebastian]], the Spoonful took their earliest influences from [[jug band]] and [[blues]] music, reworking them into a [[popular music]] format. In 1965, the band helped pioneer the development of the musical genre of folk rock. By 1966, the group were "one of the most highly regarded American {{nowrap|bands",<ref name="O'Grady">{{cite journal |last1=O'Grady |first1=Terence J. |title=A Rock Retrospective |journal=Music Educators Journal |date=1979 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=34–107 |doi=10.2307/3395757 |jstor=3395757 |s2cid=192057162 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3395757 |issn=0027-4321|url-access=subscription }}</ref>}} and they were the year's third-best-selling singles act in the US, after [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. As [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] expanded in popularity in 1967, the Spoonful struggled to transition their approach and saw diminished sales before disbanding in 1968.

Before they founded the Spoonful, Sebastian (guitar, harmonica, [[autoharp]], vocals) and [[Zal Yanovsky]] (guitar, vocals) were active in Greenwich Village's [[American folk music revival|folk-music scene]]. Aiming to create an "electric jug band",{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=214}} they recruited the local rock musicians [[Steve Boone]] (bass guitar) and [[Joe Butler]] (drums, vocals). The four-piece lineup honed their sound at New York nightclubs before they began recording for [[Kama Sutra Records]] with the producer [[Erik Jacobsen]]. In May{{nbsp}}1966, at the height of the band's success, [[The Lovin' Spoonful's drug bust|Yanovsky and Boone were arrested]] for marijuana possession in San Francisco. The pair revealed their drug source to authorities to avoid Yanovsky being deported to his native Canada, an action which generated tensions within the group. Due to disagreements over their artistic direction, the band fired Yanovsky in May{{nbsp}}1967, replacing him with [[Jerry Yester]], and Yanovsky commenced a brief and commercially unsuccessful solo career. The original iteration of the Spoonful last publicly performed in June{{nbsp}}1968, after which time Sebastian departed the group and pursued a briefly successful solo career. The band dissolved later that year.

In 2000, the Spoonful were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], an occasion that saw Sebastian, Yanovsky, Boone and Butler perform together for the last time. Yanovsky died of a heart attack two years later. Sebastian has remained active as a solo act, and Boone, Butler and Yester began touring under the name ''the Lovin' Spoonful'' in 1991.

Yanovsky grew up in [[Downsview]], a suburb of Toronto, Canada, and he was enmeshed as a guitar player in the city's folk-music scene, which centered on the [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]] neighborhood.{{sfn|Bunch|2017|p=343}} [[Denny Doherty]], another musician active in Yorkville,{{sfn|Bunch|2017|p=343}} invited Yanovsky to join his folk group, [[the Halifax Three]], which later relocated to Greenwich Village.{{sfn|Mersereau|2015|loc=chap. 4}} After the Halifax Three broke up in June{{nbsp}}1964,{{sfn|Rees|Crampton|1991|p=316}} Elliot recruited Yanovsky and Doherty to join her own group, [[The Mugwumps (band)|the Mugwumps]].{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|pp=72–73}} That same year, Sebastian briefly played with another New York folk group, the [[Even Dozen Jug Band]], before he was also recruited into the Mugwumps to play harmonica.{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|pp=75, 123}}{{refn|group=nb|[[Warner Bros.

Sebastian later remembered becoming enamoured with Yanovsky: "[He] amused the hell out of me. He inhaled and exhaled people and conversation and jokes and theater. He was this kind of cultural weathervane – and people gathered around him."{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=214}} During live performances with the Mugwumps, rather than playing folk songs straight through, Yanovsky and Sebastian often improvised off of one another on guitar and harmonica, respectively.{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=214}} After the Mugwumps dissolved in late{{nbsp}}1964, Sebastian and Yanovsky began planning to form their own group,{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|pp=75, 123}}{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=45}} which they envisioned as an electric [[jug band]].{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=214}}{{refn|group=nb|Elliott and Doherty went on to form [[the Mamas & the Papas]].{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=205}}}} Sebastian recalled: "Yanovsky and I were both aware of the fact that this commercial folk music model was about to change again, that the four-man band that actually played their own instruments and wrote their own songs was the thing."{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=214}} Yanovsky contacted [[Bob Cavallo]], the former manager of the Halifax Three and the Mugwumps, who agreed to manage Sebastian and Yanovsky's group even though they had not yet performed publicly, had no songs and did not yet have a band name.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=45–48}}

In 1964, Sebastian lived in an apartment on Prince Street in [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]], a Manhattan neighborhood south of Greenwich Village. That year, [[Erik Jacobsen]], the former banjo player of the bluegrass band [[Knob Lick Upper 10,000]], moved into the apartment next door,{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=212}} and the two soon bonded over their shared interests of smoking marijuana and listening to eclectic music.{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=212}}{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|pp=69–70}} Like Sebastian, Jacobsen had been affected by the new sound of the Beatles; he later recalled that while touring in early{{nbsp}}1964, he listened to the group for the first time on a [[jukebox]]: "I decided, kind of then and there I think, that I was gonna quit the Knob Lick Upper 10,000, and go to New York City, and produced electric folk music."{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=212}} As part of his effort to switch focus towards production, Jacobsen recorded [[Demo (music)|demos]] for musicians in the Village,{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=213}} including Sebastian's compositions "Warm Baby" and {{nowrap|"Rooty-Toot".{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=70}}{{refn|group=nb|Both of Sebastian's demos featured experimentation and exotic instruments, including African drums, bongo drums and a [[sitar]].

==== Earliest lineup ====

From 1962 to 1964, [[Steve Boone]] played bass guitar in several [[Long Island]] rock bands with the drummer [[Joe Butler]].{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=123}} They both played in the Kingsmen, a band led by Boone's brother, Skip, before Boone quit in mid-1964 to spend time visiting Europe. Skip and Butler changed the band's name to ''the Sellouts'' and moved to Greenwich Village, holding a residency at [[Trude Heller's]] club as one of the neighborhood's earliest rock groups.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=11–15, 23–24, 32}}

In December{{nbsp}}1964,{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=123}} at the insistence of Butler, Boone went to the Village Music Hall, a small music club on West 3rd Street in Greenwich Village.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=34–35}} There, he met Sebastian and Yanovsky,{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=36}} and though he had no background in folk music,{{sfn|Unterberger|2003|p=123}} Boone soon bonded with the two over their shared musical influences, including [[Elvis Presley]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Motown]], the Beatles and other [[British Invasion]] acts.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=36}} Sebastian played him his composition "[[Good Time Music]]" – the lyrics of which derided early 1960s [[rock and roll]] while extolling the Beatles and other new music – and the three musicians [[jam session|jammed]] different Chuck Berry and R&B numbers.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=35–38}} Sebastian invited Boone to Jacobsen's apartment afterwards, where Boone met Jacobsen as well as [[Jerry Yester]] of the [[Modern Folk Quartet]], a local folk music group.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=39}} That week, Boone attended Sebastian's performance at a Greenwich Village club.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=39–41}} Sebastian's show, made up of a quickly assembled group of Fred Neil, [[Tim Hardin]], [[Buzzy Linhart]] and [[Felix Pappalardi]], greatly impressed Boone,{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=39–41}}{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=124}} who later remembered it as "one of the most significant nights in my musical life."{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=124}} He also recalled: "I was stunned. I had never heard such power in a folk group before."{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=124}} The performance motivated Boone to enter the Greenwich Village folk scene and join Sebastian and Yanovsky's group.{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=124}}

The band was still in need of a drummer, and Boone suggested Jan Buchner, a part-timer with the Kingsmen who came at the recommendation of both Skip and Butler.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=48}} Buchner, who went by the stagename Jan Carl, was the manager of the Bull's Head Inn, a small inn located in [[Bridgehampton, New York|Bridgehampton]] on Long Island, and which he offered as a rehearsal space during the inn's winter closure. The band rehearsed at the Bull's Head for several weeks in December{{nbsp}}1964 and January{{nbsp}}1965, and they also played at local bars in Bridgehampton at night.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=48–51}}

In late{{nbsp}}1964 and early{{nbsp}}1965, to keep earning money before his new band had earned a contract, Sebastian continued performing as a studio musician on other artists' recordings.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=47}} In this period, he played harmonica on [[progressive folk]] records for several acts, including [[Fred Neil]], [[Jesse Colin Young]] and [[Judy Collins]].{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=75}}{{refn|group=nb|Sebastian played harmonica on [[Vince Martin (singer)|Vince Martin]] and Neil's 1964 album ''Tear Down the Walls'' and on several 1965 albums, including Neil's ''[[Bleecker & MacDougal]]'', Young's ''[[Young Blood (Jesse Colin Young album)|Young Blood]]'' and Collins's ''[[Fifth Album]]''.{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|pp=75, 123}}}} In January{{nbsp}}1965,{{sfn|Heylin|2021|p=297}} the musician [[Bob Dylan]] asked Sebastian to play bass guitar on his newest album, ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]''.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=53}} The album's first day of sessions, January{{nbsp}}13, featured only Dylan on an acoustic guitar and, for a few tracks, Sebastian playing bass guitar, but none of the recordings were used on the final album.{{sfn|Heylin|1996|p=65}}<ref name="OB">{{cite web |last=Björner |first=Olof |author-link=Olof Björner |title=Still On The Road: 1965 Concerts, Interviews & Recording Sessions |url=https://www.bjorner.com/DSN00785%20(65).htm |website=About Bob |access-date=September 8, 2023 |archive-date=August 22, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220822153419/https://www.bjorner.com/DSN00785%20%2865%29.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|According to the Dylan researcher [[Olof Björner]], Sebastian played bass on unused takes of "[[Love Minus Zero/No Limit]]" and "[[She Belongs To Me]]" and harmonica on "[[Outlaw Blues]]".<ref name="OB" /> The recordings were officially released on the 2015 album ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966|The Cutting Edge 1965–1966]]''.{{sfn|Flanagan|Wilentz|2015}}}} Dylan returned the next day to re-record much of the material, rearranging the songs attempted the day before so they instead featured an electric backing.{{sfn|Heylin|1996|p=66}} Dylan invited Sebastian to return for a separate session held that evening,{{sfn|Heylin|1996|p=66}} in which they recorded a remake of the song "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]".<ref name="OB" /> Boone –  one of the few people Sebastian knew with a car and driver's license – offered to drive him to the session.{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=110}}{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=51}} Sebastian was not a trained bass player and, after struggling to play the part, he suggested that Boone play instead,{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|pp=109–110}}{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=51–54}} but neither musician's contributions ended up on the final album.{{sfn|Heylin|1996|pp=65–66}}{{refn|group=nb|Later authors have sometimes doubted that there was an evening session on the 14th,{{sfn|Heylin|2021|p=297}}{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=110}} but [[American Federation of Musicians|AFM]] records indicate Sebastian and Boone were present for a three-hour session.{{sfn|Heylin|2021|p=297}} The pair are in photographs of the session taken by the photographer Daniel Kramer.{{sfn|Heylin|2021|p=297}}}}

In early{{nbsp}}1965, in preparation for their first public performances, Sebastian, Yanovsky, Boone and Carl continued rehearsing at the Bull's Head, while Sebastian and Yanovsky searched for a group name.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=54–55}} [[Fritz Richmond]], the [[washtub bass]] player for the [[Jim Kweskin Jug Band]], suggested to Sebastian the name ''the Lovin' Spoonful'',{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=54–55}}{{sfn|Von Schmidt|Rooney|1994|p=246}} a reference to the lyrics of the song "Coffee Blues" by the country blues musician [[Mississippi John Hurt]],{{sfn|Myers|2017|p=74}} with whom Sebastian had previously worked.{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=124}} Sebastian and Yanovsky were enthusiastic about the suggestion and adopted it as the band's name.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=55}}

Joe Marra, the owner of Greenwich Village's Night Owl Cafe, knew Sebastian from his time backing other artists at the club, and Marra offered to book the Spoonful at the venue.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=54}} The Night Owl was formerly an after-hours bowling alley at [[3rd Street (Manhattan)|West 3rd]] and [[MacDougal Street]]s, which Marra had recently converted into a 125-person capacity coffeehouse and restaurant for folk music acts.{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|pp=215–216}} The band made their first live performances in late January 1965 at the Night Owl, holding a two-week residency.{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=214}} One show, which Jacobsen recorded on a tape recorder, featured a mixture of Sebastian's originals ("Good Time Music" and "Didn't Want to Have to Do It"), folk songs ("Wild About My Lovin{{'"}} and "My Gal") and rock and roll ("[[(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66|Route 66]]", "[[Alley Oop (song)|Alley Oop]]" and "[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]").{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=57–59}}{{refn|group=nb|Decades later, the recording was considered for release on CD as ''Live at the Night Owl'', but Sebastian rejected the idea.

Having fired Carl, the Spoonful could no longer play at the Bull's Head and were in need of a new rehearsal space.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=60, 62}} The band had little money and had been living with Elliot in her Village apartment at the [[Hotel Albert (New York, New York)|Hotel Albert]].{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=46–47}} The Albert was frequented by many local folk musicians, and the building's proprietors allowed musicians staying there to rehearse in its basement, a decaying space with standing pools of water, chipping walls and a bug infestation.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=47, 60, 62}} While at the Albert, the band befriended one of the building's permanent residents, Butchie Webber, who often fed them meals. Though the two were not romantic, Webber married Sebastian, so as to prevent him from being drafted into fighting in the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=62, 151}} Butler, who still played drums for the Sellouts, auditioned for the Spoonful in the Albert's basement.

The Spoonful performed two sets at Club 47 and initially received a mixed reception; many folk fans walked out of the first set due to the band's loud sound.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=78}} Years later, Sebastian recalled a moment from the first set: {{blockquote|[This woman] carefully [got my] and Zally's attention, points out toward the amplifier, and puts her fingers in her ears.

Early in the Spoonful's May residency at the Night Owl,{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=216}} Sebastian wrote a new song, "[[Do You Believe in Magic (song)|Do You Believe in Magic]]", which explored the transformative power of music.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=62–63}} His initial inspiration came during one of the band's performances, in which he and Yanovsky noticed a sixteen-year-old girl dancing among the audience.{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|pp=216–217}}{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=136}} The girl stood in contrast to the older [[beatnik]] crowd who typically attended folk performances,{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=136}} and Sebastian recalled that "[she was] dancing like {{em|we}} danced – and not like the last generation danced".{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|p=216}} He also remembered: "Zal and I just elbowed each other the entire night, because to us, that young girl symbolized the fact that our audience was changing, that maybe they had finally found us."{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=136}} Sebastian composed the song the following night,{{sfn|Fletcher|2009|pp=216–217}}{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=136}} and the band worked together at the Albert to finish its arrangement.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=63}}

The Spoonful was enthusiastic about "Do You Believe in Magic" and hoped to record a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the song to flog to record companies.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=63}} In June{{nbsp}}1965,{{sfn|Edmonds|2002}} Jacobsen fronted a session with his own money at [[Bell Sound Studios]] in New York, where the band recorded "Do You Believe in Magic" and several other songs.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=63}}{{sfn|Edmonds|2002}}{{refn|group=nb|Which other songs were on the demo is {{nowrap|disputed.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=63}}{{sfn|Edmonds|2002}}}} Boone and the journalist Ben Edmonds each write it was "Wild About My Lovin{{'"}} and an electric arrangement "Younger Girl",{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=63}}{{sfn|Edmonds|2002}} but Jacobsen suggested it only included "On the Road Again".{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=63}}}} Jacobsen invited Yester to participate in the session, adding both piano and backing vocals,{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=64}} and the session musician [[Gary Chester]] played tambourine.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bosso |first1=Joe |title=John Sebastian: My Career in Five Songs |url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/john-sebastian-my-career-in-five-songs |website=[[Guitar Player]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205043358/https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/john-sebastian-my-career-in-five-songs |archive-date=February 5, 2023 |language=en |date=June 7, 2021 |quote=The recording came together quickly.

[[Elektra Records]] approached the Spoonful and offered to sign them.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=67}}{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=125}} Elektra regularly produced acts from Greenwich Village, including the Even Dozen Jug Band and [[the Paul Butterfield Blues Band]]. The label's offer would have allowed the Spoonful to retain Jacobsen as their producer and Cavallo as their manager, but the band worried that Elektra had not been successful at issuing singles in the pop market,{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=66–67}} and that they would not be clearly identified as a rock act if they signed at a folk-oriented label.{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=125}} Cavallo approached [[Paul Rothchild]] and [[Jac Holzman]] of Elektra and said the band needed an advance of $10,000 before they could sign ({{Inflation|US|10000|1965|fmt=eq|r=-3|cursign=US$}}).{{sfn|Holzman|Daws|2000|p=124}}{{Inflation/fn|US}} Holzman initially refused due to the large figure, but he soon changed his mind and offered the band a deal, by which point they had signed elsewhere.{{sfn|Holzman|Daws|2000|p=124}} The band instead signed a side-deal with Elektra,{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=67}} which had them record four songs, including Sebastian's song "Good Time Music".{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=125}} Jacobsen later said that the band offered the songs to Elektra out of guilt, since "We had kind of hung [Holzman] out to dry just a little bit{{nbsp}}... [so we] allowed him to have those sides.{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=125}} The label later included the four songs on the compilation album ''[[What's Shakin']]'', released the following year.{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=125}}{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=70}}

The Spoonful signed with Koppelman-Rubin, an entertainment company,{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=71}} who signed the band to [[Kama Sutra Records]] in June{{nbsp}}1965.{{sfn|Helander|1999|p=237}} As part of the deal, [[MGM Records]] distributed the records, which Kama Sutra released for Koppelman-Rubin.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=71}} The arrangement's format of multiple [[Intermediary|middlemen]] left little in profits for the band.{{sfn|Holzman|Daws|2000|p=124}}{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=71}} Sebastian later said that not signing with Elektra was "the worst decision I ever made in my life".{{sfn|Houghton|2010|p=173}}

Kama Sutra saw no need to re-record Jacobsen's original demo of the Spoonful performing "Do You Believe in Magic", and the label pressed copies to be the band's debut single.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=71}} The label issued it in the US on July 20, 1965,{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Barone|2022|p=200}} and it debuted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] a month later,{{sfn|Edmonds|2002}} remaining on the chart for thirteen weeks and peaking in October at number nine.<ref name="Billboard chart history">{{cite magazine |title=The Lovin' Spoonful Chart History (Hot 100) |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-lovin-spoonful/chart-history/hsi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=March 11, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221121215619/https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-lovin-spoonful/chart-history/hsi/ |archive-date=November 21, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Though excited at the prospect of being propelled quickly to a national audience, the band were unenthusiastic at the idea of having to change their name to ''[[The Monkees]]'' and were worried that their ability to create and play their own music would be limited by the venture. They declined the offer.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=91–93}} Rafelson later said that the Spoonful was the only existing group considered for the show before they began auditioning individual actors and musicians in September{{nbsp}}1965.{{sfn|Sandoval|2005|pp=23, 26}}

Amid their busy TV and live-date schedule, the Spoonful recorded most of their second album ''[[Daydream (The Lovin' Spoonful album)|Daydream]]'' in four days, from December{{nbsp}}13 to 16, at [[Bell Sound Studios]] in New York City.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=104}} Some songs for the album were recorded in November, including "[[You Didn't Have to Be So Nice]]", and additional sessions took place at [[CBS Studio Building|Columbia Studios]] in New York City and RCA Studios in [[Hollywood, California]].{{sfn|Diken|2002}} Boone began "You Didn't Have to Be So Nice" as a verse and a basic melodic figure, and Sebastian collaborated with him to complete the song.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=89–90}} Kama Sutra  issued the song as a non-album single on November{{nbsp}}13,{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=xx}} and it peaked at number ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in January{{nbsp}}1966.<ref name="Billboard chart history" />{{sfn|Diken|2002}} The sessions for ''Daydream'' came ten weeks after the band finished their first album, and the band had had little time to rehearse new material. Owing to the constraints, they recorded some Sebastian compositions which Jacobsen had rejected for inclusion on their debut album, including "Didn't Want to Have to Do It" and "Warm Baby".{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=104–105}} While ''Do You Believe in Magic'' contained just five original compositions, eleven out of twelve tracks on ''Daydream'' were original.

[[File:Daydream Billboard advertisement.png|thumb|[[Kama Sutra Records]]' trade ad for the "[[Daydream (The Lovin' Spoonful song)|Daydream]]" single fueled press speculation that the band's name alluded to drug use.]]

==== Marijuana bust ====
{{Main|The Lovin' Spoonful's drug bust}}
On May{{nbsp}}20, 1966, Boone and Yanovsky were arrested in San Francisco for possessing marijuana, then an illegal drug. Police discovered the marijuana after pulling the pair over and searching their vehicle.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=121–126}} Boone and Yanovsky spent the night in jail before being bailed out the following morning by the Spoonful's road manager, Rich Chiaro.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=127–128}} Cavallo and Charley Koppelman flew out to meet the band to begin managing the situation, and they hired [[Melvin Belli]] to be their attorney. Sebastian and Butler were not immediately informed of the nature of the bust, and the band's May 21 performance at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Hearst Greek Theatre|Greek Theatre]] went forward as normal.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=129–131}}

{{quote box|quote= We were the first big rock band to get busted for weed. There was no playbook in effect.

At a meeting with San Francisco police and the [[San Francisco District Attorney's Office|District Attorney]], Yanovsky was threatened with deportation back to his native Canada.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=130–131}} Belli expressed that Yanovsky and Boone were unlikely to win on the merits of their case and that their only way to avoid charges was to cooperate with authorities.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=131–132}} The two initially balked at the idea, but they relented to avoid Yanovsky being deported, something they expected would lead to a breakup of the band.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=132}} Yanovsky and Boone cooperated with authorities to name their drug source,{{sfn|Unterberger|2003|p=61}} directing an undercover operative to their source at local party.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=135–137}} In exchange, all charges were dropped, their arrest records were expunged, the two did not need to appear in court and there was no publicity related to their arrest.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=134}} Their drug source was in turn arrested and served a brief jail sentence.{{sfn|Unterberger|2003|p=61}}

After the drug case went to court in December{{nbsp}}1966, knowledge of Yanovsky and Boone's bust became more widespread.{{sfn|Savage|2015|p=518}} The [[Underground press#North America|underground press]] was especially critical of the band.{{sfn|Unterberger|2003|p=61}} By early{{nbsp}}1967, the Spoonful's shows on the West Coast were sometimes picketed by members of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|'60s counterculture]].

=== 1967–1968: Diminished success ===
==== ''You're a Big Boy Now'' soundtrack; Yanovsky and Jacobsen fired ====

In mid-October{{nbsp}}1966, the Spoonful recorded [[You're a Big Boy Now (album)|a soundtrack album]] for the 1966 film ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]''. The film served as the master's thesis of the director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who was then attending [[UCLA Film School]].{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=163–164}} After meeting with Coppola in September to discuss the project,{{sfn|Myers|2017|p=75}} Sebastian wrote the songs on his own before presenting them to the musician [[Artie Schroeck]], who arranged the compositions for an orchestra.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=163–164}} After Butler struggled with the drum part, the session musician [[Bill LaVorgna]] played in his place.{{sfn|Myers|2017|p=77}} [[David "Fathead" Newman]] played saxophone during the sessions and [[Clark Terry]] played [[flügelhorn]].{{sfn|Myers|2017|p=77}}

{{quote box|quote= [Not working with the Spoonful anymore] was fine by me, because we had kind of run our course. We were falling apart.{{sfn|Unterberger|2003|p=61}} |source=– [[Erik Jacobsen]], 2003|width=25%|align=left|salign=right|style=padding:8px;}}

During the editing of ''You're a Big Boy Now'', Coppola used the Mamas & the Papas' 1966 single "[[Monday, Monday]]" as [[temp music]] for one sequence in the film, for which Sebastian wrote "[[Darling Be Home Soon]]".{{sfn|Myers|2017|pp=75–76}} Sebastian's composition flips a genre convention by describing a male subject waiting for a female to return home.{{sfn|Myers|2017|p=76}}{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=164}} The Spoonful recorded the song in one night, but Sebastian's original vocal track was subsequently wiped. Sebastian later attributed the loss to an accident on the part of an engineer, saying that what is heard on the final recording "is me, a half hour after learning that my original vocal track had been erased". He added: "You can even hear my voice quiver a little at the end. That was me thinking about the vocal we lost and wanting to kill someone."{{sfn|Myers|2017|p=77}} Boone instead suggests that Jacobsen deliberately erased Sebastian's vocal after finding it substandard; Boone recalled that the event marked the angriest he had ever seen Sebastian. Jacobsen was soon fired from working with the band, and Boone suggests that the vocal-erasure "probably played a major role" in Jacobsen's departure.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=163–164}}

The lack of collaboration on ''You're a Big Boy Now'' led to consternation from Sebastian's bandmates, especially Yanovsky, whose playing style often relied on improvisation.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=163–164}} Yanovsky especially disliked the soundtrack album's lead single, "Darling Be Home Soon", which was issued in early{{nbsp}}1967.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=170}}{{sfn|Myers|2017|p=74}} When the Spoonful appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in January to promote the release, Yanovsky [[Overacting|mugged]] for the camera, miming the lyrics and bouncing up-and-down with a rubber-toad figurine attached to his guitar.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=170}}{{sfn|Unterberger|2003|p=61}} The appearance led to laughter from the audience and anger from Sebastian.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=170}} "Darling Be Home Soon" peaked at number fifteen,{{sfn|Myers|2017|p=74}}{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=170}} a major disappointment compared to the band's earlier releases and their first single which failed to reach the Top Ten.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=170}} Also disappointing was the release of the ''You're a Big Boy Now'' soundtrack, which peaked at number 160 on the ''Billboard'' Top LPs chart in May{{nbsp}}1967.<ref name="Billboard chart history" />{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=173}} The album's sales were hampered by the release in March of the band's first greatest hits compilation, ''[[The Best of The Lovin' Spoonful]]'',{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=173}} which reached number three and became the band's best selling album.<ref name="Billboard chart history" />{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=173}}

{{quote box|quote= I wanted us to go back [to the clubs] and try to recapture that sort of energy{{nbsp}}...

In May{{nbsp}}1967, Sebastian convened a meeting with Butler and Boone to discuss the band's future.

[[File:The Lovin Spoonful 1968.png|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|The Spoonful with Yanovsky's replacement, [[Jerry Yester]] (left), {{circa|1967–68}}]]

The Spoonful hired Jerry Yester to replace Yanovsky on lead guitar duties. Following the May{{nbsp}}1967 meeting in which Yanovsky was fired, Sebastian suggested hiring Yester, and no other replacement was considered. Yester had been close to the band and Jacobsen for years, having contributed to the recording of "Do You Believe in Magic".{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=178}} Since mid-1966, when Yester's band the Modern Folk Quartet disbanded,<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Fisk|first=Thermon|title=Gene Clark: 'You Have to Hear It and See Yourself'|magazine=[[KRLA Beat]]|date=July 9, 1966|page=3|quote=[I]n the pop world recently{{nbsp}}...

The Spoonful reconvened in August{{nbsp}}1967 to begin sessions for their next album, ''[[Everything Playing]]''.  In need of a producer after Jacobsen's firing, the band initially hoped to work with [[Roy Halee]], who had worked as [[Audio engineer|engineer]] on the band's earlier recordings, but his continued employment with [[Columbia Records]] prevented the collaboration. Koppelman-Rubin instead suggested [[Joe Wissert]], a Philadelphia-based producer who had recently worked with [[the Turtles]] on their 1967 singles, "[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]" and "[[She'd Rather Be with Me]]". On Wissert's recommendation, the band moved from Columbia's recording studios to Mira Sound Studios, a new facility in New York City which made use of an AMPEX MM-1000, the industry's first [[Multitrack recording|16-track recorder]].{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=180–181}} The band struggled to manage the more complicated recording equipment, a situation worsened when Wissert stopped attending sessions, forcing Yester to produce in his place.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=186–187}}

Like other folk-rock acts, the Spoonful struggled to modify their musical approach as the new genre of [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]] expanded in popularity in 1967.{{sfn|Unterberger|2003|p=61}} The sessions for ''Everything Today'' yielded three singles, all three of which continued the band's downward commercial performance when they failed to place in the Top Ten.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=182, 189}} "Six O'Clock", which had been recorded at Columbia before Jacobsen and Yanovsky were fired, was released in April{{nbsp}}1967 and peaked at number 18.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=182}} For the album's next single, "She Is Still a Mystery", Yester arranged an orchestral accompaniment which included [[String section|strings]] and [[Woodwind section|woodwinds]] played by members of the [[New York Philharmonic]], along with [[Horn section|horns]] from [[Ray Charles]]' touring band.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=182}} Released in October,{{sfn|Anon.|1990}} the single reached number 27.<ref name="Billboard chart history" />{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=182}} ''Everything Playing'' was issued in December{{nbsp}}1967,{{sfn|Anon.|1990}} but received negative reviews from critics and peaked at number 118 in the US after spending seven weeks on the album chart.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=187}} The album track "Younger Generation" was originally intended for release as a single&nbsp;– a trade ad in ''Billboard'' promised it would be "the most talked-about track of 1968"&nbsp;– but its release never followed.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=183}} Instead, "Money" was issued as a single in January{{nbsp}}1968,{{sfn|Hill|2003}} and it peaked at number 48.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=189}}

==== Sebastian departs, ''Revelation: Revolution '69'' ====

After the major commercial disappointments of ''Everything Playing'' and "Money" in early{{nbsp}}1968, Sebastian advised his bandmates that, following the Spoonful's next three months of scheduled tour dates, he planned to leave the group.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=189–190}} ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' reported in April that he intended to leave by June.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Pete |author1-link=Pete Johnson (rock critic) |title=Pop Duet Issues Delayed Record |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-los-angeles-times-pop-duet-issues-de/164173373/ |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 1, 1968 |page=IV-30 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> The band last publicly performed on June{{nbsp}}1, 1968, at [[Parker Field (Richmond)|Parker Field]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=192}}<ref name=Richmond />{{refn|group=nb|In his autobiography, Boone writes the Richmond show was June{{nbsp}}20,{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=192}} but contemporary newspaper articles date it to June{{nbsp}}1.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Anon. |title=Tiny Tim, Spoonful Will Perform Here |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/richmond-times-dispatch-tiny-tim-spoonf/164193300/ |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=May 29, 1968 |page=C-15 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref><ref name=Richmond>{{cite news |last1=Venable |first1=Maggie K. |title=Lovin' Spoonful Soon to Disband: Group Plagued by Mishap |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/richmond-times-dispatch-group-plagued-by/164193987/ |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=June 7, 1968 |page=B-8 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>}} The following day, Sebastian told reporters that the group had probably played their last show together,<ref name=Richmond /> and some newspapers reported in July that the band had broken up.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gardiner |first1=Sandy |title=Off the Record |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-ottawa-journal-off-the-record-by-san/164161561/ |work=[[The Ottawa Journal]] |date=July 12, 1968 |page=18 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Winters |first1=Scott |title=On{{nbsp}}... |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-wichita-beacon-on-by-scott-winte/164172478/ |work=[[The Wichita Beacon]] |date=July 31, 1968 |page=7D |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> By September, Sebastian announced his intention to pursue a solo career.<ref name=Johnson>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Pete |title=Spoonful of Talent Out on His Own |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 30, 1968 |page=IV-18 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/96867524/john-sebastian/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |ref=none}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |author=Anon. |title=Executive Turntable |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=September 7, 1968 |pages=6, 86}}</ref> Sebastian later summed up the band's career as "two glorious years and a tedious one".{{sfn|Nixon|2003|p=615}}

Following Sebastian's departure, the remaining members of the band had little contact with one another.

=== 1968–present: After the breakup ===
==== John Sebastian ====
The Spoonful were one of several bands to have broken up in 1968.{{sfn|Hjort|2008|p=197}} In an article that December, [[Penny Valentine]] of ''[[Disc (magazine)|Disc and Music Echo]]'' counted the band's breakup and the formation of the folk-rock [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] as reflecting a consolidation in the industry, "[tying] up all the loose strings of musical talent in the pop world".{{sfn|Hjort|2008|p=197}} Sebastian was offered a position in Crosby, Stills & Nash, but he declined,{{sfn|Unterberger|2003|pp=206–207}}{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=207}} expressing his desire in a contemporary interview to focus on his solo career rather than joining a new group.{{sfn|Hjort|2008|p=197}}

Following the Spoonful's dissolution, Sebastian was the only former member whose music career initially appeared promising.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=196, 255}} Splitting time between New York City and Los Angeles, his first major project after leaving the band was composing the lyrics and music for the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show ''[[Jimmy Shine]]'',{{sfn|Shea|2023|p=343}} which ran from December{{nbsp}}1968 to April{{nbsp}}1969.{{sfn|Pollock|2009|pp=94–95}} In late{{nbsp}}1968, he signed with [[Warner Records]] and he recorded a solo album, ''[[John B.

In the decade after he left the Spoonful, Sebastian was active in the concert and festival circuit, and he typically played around 100 shows a year.{{sfn|Helander|1999|p=237}} He made an impromptu appearance at the [[Woodstock]] festival in August{{nbsp}}1969, in which he played the Spoonful's songs "Darling Be Home Soon" and "Younger Generation".{{sfn|Unterberger|2003|p=278}} Despite his initial successes, Sebastian struggled as a songwriter for most of the 1970s.{{sfn|Unterberger|2003|p=290}}{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=255}} His 1974 album ''[[Tarzana Kid]]'' did not chart, but it was produced by Erik Jacobsen, marking the first time the two collaborated since their falling out years earlier.{{sfn|Rees|Crampton|1991|p=317}}{{sfn|Unterberger|2006c}} After his first five singles were commercial failures, Sebastian's label planned to drop him;{{sfn|Rees|Crampton|1991|p=317}} he achieved a number one hit in 1976 with "[[Welcome Back (John Sebastian song)|Welcome Back]]", the theme song for the TV show ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'', but he was unable to translate it into continued success.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=255}}

==== Steve Boone, Joe Butler and reunions ====

In 1969, Boone attempted to record a solo album, but the project dissolved. That same year, he produced an album for the Virginia-based folk group the Oxpetals, after which he left the music business.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=196–205}} Butler pivoted to Broadway acting,{{sfn|Hoffmann|2016|p=270}} and he performed in the rock musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=219}} He also worked as a sound editor in Hollywood,{{sfn|Hoffmann|2016|p=270}} but by later in the 1970s he was no longer active in music and instead drove a taxi cab.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=256}}

Sebastian resisted subsequent efforts to reform the Spoonful,{{sfn|Nixon|2003|p=615}} and the original members of the band only reunited twice.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=255–257, 281}} In late{{nbsp}}1979, at the invitation of the musician [[Paul Simon]], the band appeared in his 1980 film ''[[One-Trick Pony (film)|One-Trick Pony]]'' in a concert sequence which featured several 1960s acts.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=255–257}} The band did not see each other again until March{{nbsp}}2000, when the four original members were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in Cleveland.{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|p=281}} Yanovsky died of a heart attack two years later.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Keepnews |first1=Peter |title=Zal Yanovsky, 57, Guitarist With Lovin' Spoonful in 60's |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/17/arts/zal-yanovsky-57-guitarist-with-lovin-spoonful-in-60-s.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 17, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230528061858/https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/17/arts/zal-yanovsky-57-guitarist-with-lovin-spoonful-in-60-s.html |archive-date=May 28, 2023 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite their origins in folk music, Sebastian and Yanovsky were early fans of rock and roll.

He also counted the pianist [[Huey "Piano" Smith]] as another of Yanovsky's major influences.<ref name=Documentary />}} He recalled that Yanovsky, by contrast, later admitted to being intimidated by Sebastian's clean playing, but that this became a guide to the pair's work together, where he provided a foundation onto which Yanovsky could "come in and throw flowers".<ref name="Shiner Sebastian" /> Yanovsky's playing relied heavily on improvisation,{{sfn|Boone|Moss|2014|pp=163–164}} and he often drew from country music, leading the commentator [[Peter Doggett]] to describe him as "the missing link between fifties [[rockabilly]] and sixties folk-rock".{{sfn|Doggett|2001|p=41}}

Sebastian played a 1957 sunburst [[Gibson Les Paul]] electric guitar in live performances and on the band's recordings,<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=225}}: "The serial number on the back of the instrument's headstock is not in the correct original typeface and style, but reads 7-8789 which would date the guitar's manufacture to late{{nbsp}}1957.

The Spoonful's image was influential on their contemporaries.{{sfn|Savage|2015|p=143}} The band's stage act was both eccentric and extroverted,{{sfn|Helander|1999|p=236}} driven by Yanovsky, who Jacobsen later said "invented the hole-y jeans, falling apart T-shirts, crazy rock guitar antics on stage, the whole subsequent thing of rock 'n' roll guitar[ists] being wild, crazy individualists".{{sfn|Unterberger|2002|p=174}} The author [[Bob Stanley (musician)|Bob Stanley]] later described the band's look as a clash between that of the [[Beatniks]] and the Beatles,{{sfn|Stanley|2015|p=124}} and the American men's fashion magazine ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' produced a fashion spread of the band in its June{{nbsp}}1966 issue, detailing how the group sported "[[Mod (subculture)|mod]] gear", but from New York's [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] rather than London's [[Carnaby Street]].{{sfn|Hill|2018|p=97}}
