Known for their [[face paint]] and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-1970s with [[shock rock]]–style live performances that featured fire-breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and [[pyrotechnics]]. The band went through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons remaining the only consistent members. The final lineup consisted of Stanley, Simmons, [[Tommy Thayer]] (lead guitar, vocals) and [[Eric Singer]] (drums, vocals).

With their makeup and costumes, the band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and the Catman (Criss). During the second half of the 1970s, Kiss became one of America's most successful rock bands and a pop culture phenomenon. The band's commercial success declined during the early 1980s; however, it experienced a resurgence in 1983 when the band members began performing without makeup and costumes, marking the beginning of the band's "unmasked" era that would last until 1996. The first album of this era, 1983's [[platinum-certified]] ''[[Lick It Up]]'', successfully introduced the band to a new generation of fans, and its music videos received regular airplay on [[MTV]]. In response to a wave of Kiss [[nostalgia]] in the mid-1990s, the original lineup reunited in 1996; at this time, the band resumed using makeup and stage costumes. The resulting [[Alive/Worldwide Tour|1996–1997 reunion tour]] was the band's most successful, grossing $143.7&nbsp;million. In January 2019, Kiss began its [[End of the Road World Tour|final worldwide tour]], and the band retired after performing its final show in New York City in December 2023.

==History==

===1971–1975: early years===
[[File:Kiss debut album photo session (1974).jpg|thumb|left|Kiss's original lineup in 1974. L–R: Paul Stanley, Peter Criss, Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley]]
Kiss traces its roots to [[Wicked Lester]], a New York City–based rock band led by [[Gene Simmons]] and [[Paul Stanley]]. That band recorded one album, which was shelved by [[Epic Records]], and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 14.</ref><ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 68–71.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 20–21.</ref>

Kiss was formed in 1973.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/entertainment/music/2025/03/11/kiss-band-gene-simmons-paul-stanley-photos/82248180007/|title=A look back at KISS: Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and more rock 'n' roll moments|website=USA TODAY|date=March 11, 2025}}</ref> After breaking up Wicked Lester late in 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] version of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed by [[Peter Criss]], a drummer from the New York City scene who had previously played in the bands Lips and [[Chelsea (American band)|Chelsea]].{{sfn|Brod|2020|p=15}} Simmons and Stanley met Criss in a nightclub where he was playing drums. After hearing Criss sing, they thought Criss should be in the new band they were forming. Criss then auditioned for, and later joined their new band. The three focused on a much harder style of rock than that played by Wicked Lester. In November 1972, the band played a showcase for Epic Records [[A&R]] director Don Ellis, in an effort to secure a record deal.{{sfn|Weiss|2016|p=59}} In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist [[Ace Frehley]]. Frehley impressed the group with his first audition, and was asked back for a second audition. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the classic lineup was solidified as the band to be named Kiss.<ref name="acebio">{{cite web |url=http://www.kayosproductions.com/artists.php?id=57 |title=Artist bio: Ace Frehley |publisher=Kayos Productions |access-date=January 6, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080049/http://www.kayosproductions.com/artists.php?id=57 |archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> They also began experimenting with their image, by wearing makeup and various outfits.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 33, 57–58.</ref>

[[File:Kiss Logo.svg|thumb|upright|The Kiss logo]]

Stanley came up with the name while he, Simmons, and Criss were driving around New York City. Criss mentioned that he had been in a band called Lips, so Stanley said something to the effect of "What about Kiss?"<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Gene Simmons]] |date=1987 |title=[[Exposed (Kiss)|Exposed]] |type=VHS |publisher=[[Mercury Records|Mercury]]}}</ref> Frehley created the now-iconic logo, making the "SS" look like lightning bolts, when he went to write the new band name over "Wicked Lester" on a poster outside the club where they were going to play.<ref>Gebert and McAdams, ''Kiss & Tell'', pp. 41, 42.</ref> (Some of Wicked Lester's artwork included one lightning bolt for the "S" in Lester.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2013/06/iconic-logos |title=Iconic New York Music Logos Explained – Kiss |date=April 29, 2013 |work=Red Bull Music Academy |last=Apfelbaum |first=Sue |page=12 |access-date=June 16, 2017}} Article also hosted by Sue Apfelbaum [https://s3.amazonaws.com/external_clips/278919/Kiss_logo.pdf here.]</ref>) Later, Stanley designed the logo with a [[Sharpie (marker)|Sharpie]] and a ruler and accidentally drew the two S's nonparallel because he did it "by eye". The art department asked him if he wanted it to be redrafted to be perfect and he said, "It got us this far, let's leave well enough alone.

[[File:KISS alternate logo.svg|thumb|upright|Modified Kiss logo used in Germany, Austria, and other countries that outlaw Nazi symbols]]

The letters happened to look similar to the insignia of the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], a symbol that is outlawed in Germany by [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|Section 86a]] of the German criminal code. However, Simmons and Stanley, both Jewish, have denied any intentional likeness to Nazi symbolism in the logo. Since 1980, most of the band's album covers and merchandise in Germany have used a different logo, in which the letters "SS" look like the letters "ZZ" backwards. This logo is also used in Austria, Switzerland, Lithuania, and Hungary to avoid controversy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/kiss-nazi-logo_n_577430ade4b0bd4b0b13779c |title=Ace Frehley Addresses Theory About The Famous Kiss Logo |last=Van Luling |first=Todd |date=July 8, 2016 |work=HuffPost |access-date=January 27, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=May 18, 2020 |first=Matthew |last=Wilkening |title=How Nazi Comparisons Forced Kiss to Change Their Logo in Germany |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-german-logo/ |access-date=January 27, 2021 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>

The band's name has repeatedly been the subject of rumors pertaining to alleged hidden meanings. Among these rumors are theories that the name is an acronym for "Knights in Satan's Service", "Kinder SS", or "Kids in Satan's Service". Simmons has denied all of these claims.<ref name="simmons">Simmons, Gene (2001). ''Kiss and Make-up''.

The first Kiss performance took place on January 30, 1973, for an audience of fewer than ten people at the Popcorn Club (renamed Coventry shortly afterward) in [[Queens]]. The band was paid $50 for performing two sets that evening, following a cold-call Simmons had made to the venue, convincing them to hire the new band for a three-night stand.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-first-concert/ |title=The Day Kiss Played Their First Show |work=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=August 22, 2020 |last=Wilkening |first=Matthew}}</ref> For the first three gigs, January 30 to February 1, they wore makeup, but the iconic character designs associated with Kiss made their debuts during the March 9–10 shows at The Daisy in [[Amityville, New York]].

{{blockquote|Our first show ever was at Coventry. Coventry was a study in contrasts. The first time we played there was nobody there. The last time we played there, you could barely get in the door.|Paul Stanley<ref>(2019). ''End of the Road World Tour Program'', p. 4.</ref>}}

On March 13 of that year, the band recorded a five-song demo tape with producer [[Eddie Kramer]]. Former TV director [[Bill Aucoin]], who had seen the group at a handful of showcase concerts in the summer of 1973, offered to become the band's manager in mid-October. Kiss agreed, with the condition that Aucoin signed the band to a record label within two weeks. On November 1, 1973, Kiss became the first act signed to former teen pop singer and [[Buddah Records]] executive [[Neil Bogart]]'s new label, [[Casablanca Records]].<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 145–146.</ref>

The band entered [[Bell Sound Studios]] in New York City on October 10, 1973, to begin recording its first album. On December 31, the band had its official industry premiere at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|Academy of Music]] in New York City, opening for [[Blue Öyster Cult]]. It was at this concert that, for the first of many times, Simmons accidentally set his hair (which was coated in hairspray) ablaze while performing his fire-breathing routine.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 27.</ref> His trademark stalking stage-moves were inspired by the creature ''Ymir'' of the movie ''[[20 Million Miles to Earth]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2013/08/31/first-kiss/ |title=First KISS |work=New York Post |last=Getlen |first=Larry |date=August 31, 2013 |access-date=May 3, 2025}}</ref>

Kiss's first tour started on February 5, 1974, in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], a cafeteria at the [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]], as an opening act.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/sait-students-commemorate-50-anniversary-kiss-show-campus |title=SAIT students commemorate 50-year anniversary of Kiss show |work=Calgary Herald |last=Rodriguez |first=Michael |access-date=February 6, 2024}}</ref> The band's [[Kiss (Kiss album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on February 18. Casablanca and Kiss promoted the album heavily throughout the spring and summer of 1974.

{{blockquote|Being in Kiss in the very first year and touring around the United States, we felt like we were taking off. It was like somebody pushing you into the deep end of the pool whether you can swim or not. The early years of Kiss were far from glamorous. We rode in a station wagon hundreds of miles every day. We would take turns driving and sleeping in the back. We ate burgers at roadside taverns. We stopped and peed on the side of long stretches of a highway when we couldn't find a town anywhere near. We ate beans and franks because we couldn't afford better food as we were on an $85 a week salary! Becoming a rock star was better than anything and beyond anything I ever imagined. There were moments of doubt for me that we were gonna make it.|Gene Simmons<ref>(2019). End of the Road World Tour Program, p. 5.</ref>}}

On February 19, in its first television appearance, the band performed "[[Nothin' to Lose (Kiss song)|Nothin' to Lose]]", "[[Firehouse (Kiss song)|Firehouse]]" and "[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]" on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[In Concert (American TV series)|In Concert]]'' (aired March 29).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kielty |first1=Martin |title=When Kiss Made Their National TV Debut |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-national-tv-debut/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=March 29, 2021}}</ref> On April 29, the band performed "Firehouse" on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. This broadcast included Simmons's first televised interview, a conversation with [[Mike Douglas]] in which Simmons declared himself "evil incarnate", eliciting uncomfortable reactions from a confused studio audience. Fellow Jewish-American guest [[Totie Fields]] said it would be humorous if beneath all the makeup Simmons was "just a [[nice Jewish boy]]". Simmons responded, "You should only know", to which Fields replied, "I do. You can't hide the [[Hook nose|hook]]", a reference to the [[Jewish nose|stereotypical "Jewish" nose]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Greene |first1=Andy |title=Flashback: Kiss Perform 'Firehouse' on 'The Mike Douglas Show' in 1974 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kiss-biopic-firehouse-live-1974-1159821/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=April 22, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite video |date=October 31, 2006 |title=Kissology Volume One: 1974–1977 |type=DVD |publisher=[[VH1 Classic]]}}</ref>

Despite the publicity and constant touring, ''Kiss'' initially sold just 75,000 copies. Meanwhile, the group and Casablanca Records were losing money quickly. The band (while touring) stopped in Los Angeles in August 1974 to begin recording its second album, ''[[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter Than Hell]]'', which was released on October 22, 1974. The only single, "[[Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll]]", failed to chart, and the album stalled at No. 100.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 140–141.</ref>

With ''Hotter Than Hell'' quickly dropping off the charts, Kiss was pulled from its tour to quickly record a new album. Casablanca head Bogart stepped in to produce the next album, trading in the murky, distorted sound of ''Hotter Than Hell'' for a cleaner and slightly poppier sound. ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'', released on March 19, 1975, fared slightly better commercially than ''Hotter Than Hell''. It also contained what later became the band's signature song, "[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]".<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic |class=album |id=r11054/review |pure_url=yes}} |title=Review ''Dressed to Kill'' |last=Prato |first=Greg |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=January 6, 2010}}</ref>

Although Kiss albums had not proved to be big sellers, the band was quickly gaining a reputation for its live performances. Kiss concerts featured such spectacles as Simmons spitting "blood" (an effect made primarily from eggs, yogurt, red food coloring, and maple syrup) and "breathing fire" (spitting flammable liquid at a torch), Frehley soloing as his guitar burst into flames (light and smoke bombs placed inside the guitar), Criss's elevating drum riser that emitted sparks, Stanley's [[Pete Townshend|Townshend]]-style guitar smashing, and pyrotechnics throughout the show.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/1996/08/16/tour-kiss/ |title=On tour with Kiss |website=Entertainment Weekly |last=Browne |first=David |access-date=July 19, 2021}}</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 62–64.</ref>

By mid-1975, Casablanca was almost bankrupt, and Kiss was in danger of losing its record contract. Both parties desperately needed a commercial breakthrough if they were to survive.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Young |first=Charles |title=Kiss: The Pagan Beasties of Teenage Rock |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kiss-the-pagan-beasties-of-teenage-rock-20120427?print=true |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911123842/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kiss-the-pagan-beasties-of-teenage-rock-20120427?print=true |archive-date=September 11, 2012 |date=April 7, 1977 |url-status=live}}</ref> That breakthrough came in an unlikely form: a "double live" album.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic |class=album |id=r11053 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Review ''Alive!'' |last=Prato |first=Greg |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=January 6, 2010}}</ref>

===1975–1978: rise to prominence===
[[Image:Kiss Love Gun era.png|thumb|upright=0.75|Kiss in 1977]]

{{blockquote|I saw a pattern emerging with us on the road. Every night, I'd ask somebody before the show, "How are we doing?", which meant, "What's the attendance?" One night they said, "It's sold out," and then the next night I'd hear the same thing. All of a sudden it was becoming the norm. For me the first realization that things were on an upswing was when we played the Hara Arena in Dayton, Ohio. Before the show I went on stage, looked out through the curtain and saw this big crowd, and said to myself, "My God, this is really happening!"|Paul Stanley<ref>(2019). ''End of the Road World Tour Program'', p. 8.</ref>}}

Kiss wanted to express the excitement felt at its concerts (which its studio albums had so far failed to do) with its first live album. Compiled from concerts recorded between May and July in [[Wildwood, New Jersey]], Detroit and [[Cleveland]], and released on September 10, 1975, ''[[Alive! (Kiss album)|Alive!]]'' achieved [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] status and spawned Kiss's first top 40 single: a live version of "Rock and Roll All Nite". It was the first version of the song with a guitar solo, and this recording has become the best-known version. It is also the basis of most covers, such as the cover by [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] in 1987. In recent years the band admitted that additional audience noise had been added to the album, as well as overdubs on select guitar and vocal spots, not to deceive fans, but to add more "excitement and realism" to the record.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 169–172.</ref>

The success of ''Alive!'' not only brought Kiss the breakthrough they had been seeking but arguably saved Casablanca, which was close to bankruptcy. Following this success, Kiss partnered with producer [[Bob Ezrin]], who had previously worked with [[Alice Cooper]]. The result was ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' (released March 15, 1976), Kiss's most musically ambitious studio album to date. ''Destroyer'', with its rather intricate production (using an orchestra, choir, and numerous tape effects), was a departure from the raw sound of the first three studio albums. Album art was designed by [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]], who had drawn [[Tarzan]] and [[Conan the Barbarian]] and also produced album covers for acts such as [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] and [[Manowar]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Voger |title=Criss eager to meet television idol Zacherley |work=[[Asbury Park Press]] |page=6E |date=October 22, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Manowar truck to make its debut in Austria this weekend |work=Austria Today |date=September 8, 2006}}</ref> While the album sold well initially and became the group's second Gold album, it quickly dropped down the charts. Only when the ballad "[[Beth (song)|Beth]]", the [[B-side]] of the single "[[Detroit Rock City]]", began to gain more airplay on FM radio did the album's sales rebound. The single was subsequently reissued with the A- and B-sides reversed. "Beth" peaked at No. 7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the band's first Top 10 single in the United States.

[[File: Kiss in New Haven 1978.jpg|thumb|upright|Simmons and Frehley share a microphone in 1978.]]
In October 1976, Kiss appeared on ''[[The Paul Lynde Halloween Special]]'' (aired on ABC the 29th), [[lip-sync]]hing "[[Detroit Rock City]]", "[[Beth (song)|Beth]]" and "[[King of the Night Time World]]". The show, co-produced by Bill Aucoin, helped introduce Kiss to an even wider audience. In addition to the three songs, Kiss was the subject of a brief comedic "interview" conducted by [[Paul Lynde]]. This included Lynde noting, when hearing the member's first names, "Oh, I love a good religious group."

Two more highly successful studio albums were released in less than a year: ''[[Rock and Roll Over]]'' (November 11, 1976) and ''[[Love Gun]]'' (June 30, 1977). A second live album, ''[[Alive II]]'', was released on October 14, 1977. All three albums were certified Platinum soon after their release. Between 1976 and 1978, Kiss earned $17.7 million from record royalties and music publishing.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 65–66.</ref> A 1977 [[Gallup poll]] named Kiss the most popular band in America. In Japan, Kiss performed five sold-out shows at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan Hall]],{{citation needed|date=May 2024}} equaling the record set by [[the Beatles]] in 1966 with [[The Beatles' 1966 tour of Germany, Japan and the Philippines#Japan|their five concerts there]].<ref>{{Cite web |first=Patrick|last=Parr|date=2022-01-14 |title=The Beatles storm the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo in 1966 |url=https://japantoday.com/category/features/japan-yesterday/the-beatles-storm-the-nippon-budokan-in-1966 |access-date=2024-05-19 |website=Japan Today}}</ref>

In May 1977, Kiss made the first of its many comic book appearances, in ''[[Howard the Duck]]'' issue 12, published by [[Marvel Comics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/howard-the-duck-1-32-+-extras-first-kiss-in |title=Howard the Duck 1-32 + Extras - First Kiss in Comics |language=ja |website=Worthpoint.com |date=July 14, 2010 |access-date=July 28, 2010}}</ref>

The first Kiss compilation album, ''[[Double Platinum (Kiss album)|Double Platinum]]'', was issued on April 2, 1978. This double album included many remixed versions of the band's hits, as well as "Strutter '78", a re-recorded version of a song from the group's first album. At Bogart's request, this version of the song featured a [[disco]] influence.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 272–273.</ref>

During this period, [[Kiss merchandising|Kiss merchandise]] became a substantial source of income for the group. Some of the products released included a pair of comic books issued by Marvel (the first contained ink mixed with actual blood donated by the group), a [[pinball]] machine, dolls, "Kiss Your Face Makeup" kits, [[Halloween]] masks, [[board game]]s, lunch boxes, trading cards and many other pieces of memorabilia. Membership in the [[Kiss Army]], the band's fan club, was in the six figures. Between 1977 and 1979, worldwide merchandise sales (in-store and on tour) reached an estimated $100 million.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 162.</ref>

''Alive II'' was the band's fourth Platinum album in just under two years, and the ensuing tour had the highest average attendance in the group's history. In addition, Kiss's gross income for 1977 was $10.2&nbsp;million. The group, along with manager Aucoin, sought to push the brand harder. To that end, an ambitious, two-pronged strategy was devised for 1978.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 88–89.</ref>

The first part involved the simultaneous release of four solo albums from the members of Kiss. Although Kiss has claimed that the solo albums were intended to ease rising tensions within the band, its 1976 record contract did in fact call for four solo records, each of them counting as half an album toward the group's five-record commitment.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 271.</ref> Each album was a solo effort (none of the group appeared on another's album), however all were released and marketed as Kiss albums (with similar cover art and poster inserts). It was the first time that all current members of a rock band had released solo albums on the same day.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 92.</ref>

For the band members, it was a chance to showcase their individual musical styles and tastes outside of Kiss, and in some cases to collaborate with contemporary artists. Stanley's and Frehley's albums were most similar to Kiss's hard rock style, while Criss's album featured an [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] style including ballads. Simmons's was the most diverse of the four, featuring hard rock, ballads, [[Beatles]]-influenced pop and a [[cover version]] of "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]" from the Disney film ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''. Simmons's many collaborators included [[Aerosmith]]'s [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]], [[Cheap Trick]]'s [[Rick Nielsen]], [[the Doobie Brothers]]' [[Jeff "Skunk" Baxter]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Janis Ian]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Katey Sagal]], and his then-girlfriend [[Cher]].

The solo albums were released on September 18, 1978. Casablanca spent $2.5&nbsp;million on the marketing campaign for the albums, and announced they were shipping five million copies, guaranteeing Platinum status.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 94.</ref> Despite the large shipments, none of the albums sold particularly well and were later sold as [[Cut-out (recording industry)|cut-outs]]. Of the four, Simmons's album charted the highest in the U.S., peaking at No. 22, while Frehley's spawned the only resulting Top Forty hit single, a cover of "[[New York Groove]]", written by [[Russ Ballard]] and originally performed by [[Hello (band)|Hello]].<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 95</ref>  Frehley's album has gone on to be the biggest seller since the introduction of Soundscan in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kiss: SoundScan-Era Record Sales Revealed |date=February 12, 2007 |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kiss-soundscan-era-record-sales-revealed/|website=Blabbermouth.net}}</ref>

The second part of Kiss's and Aucoin's plan called for the band to appear in a film that would cement its image of larger-than-life rock-and-roll superheroes. Filming commenced in the spring of 1978. Although the project was proposed to the band as a cross between ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the final result fell far short of those expectations. The final product, ''[[Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park]]'', debuted on [[NBC]] on October 28, 1978.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kiss Meets the Phantom |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&dat=19781027&id=2cAwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RlIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5797,2535733&hl=en |access-date=May 31, 2022 |work=Google News |issue=252 |publisher=The Bryan Times |date=October 27, 1978 |location=Bryan, Ohio}}</ref> It was released theatrically, after many changes, outside the U.S. in 1979 under the title ''Attack of the Phantoms''. The band members were unhappy with the finished film and would speak about their filmmaking experience in later interviews with a mix of humorous embarrassment and regret. They felt that the film portrayed them more as clowns than superheroes. The artistic failure of the film led to a rift between the band and Aucoin.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 91–92.</ref>

===1979–1983: final makeup years===
Kiss's first album of new material in two years, ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' (1979), continued the band's Platinum streak. The disco-flavored "[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]" became one of the band's biggest hit singles to date, peaking at No. 11. Session drummer [[Anton Fig]] performed almost all the percussion on the album while Criss recovered from an automobile accident. The only song to feature Criss's drumming was "Dirty Livin'", on which he also sang lead.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 346–347.</ref> The album is also notable due to Frehley singing three lead vocals versus Simmons's two, which he put down to increased confidence following the success of his solo album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/ace_frehley_shares_honest_opinion_on_kiss_going_disco_admits_band_cheated_a_little_on_iconic_live_album.html|title=Ace Frehley Shares Honest Opinion on Kiss Going Disco, Admits Band 'Cheated a Little' on Iconic Live Album|website=Ultimate-guitar.com}}</ref>

Billed as "The Return of Kiss", the [[Dynasty Tour]] was expected by Kiss and their management to build on the success of previous tours. Plans were drawn up for a Kiss-themed traveling [[amusement park]] called "Kiss World", but were abandoned because of the immense costs involved;<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 102–105.</ref> however, "The Return of Kiss" saw a marked decline in attendance.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 98</ref>

[[File:KISS Gene Simmons 1979.jpg|thumb|left|Simmons performing with Kiss in 1979]]
The crowds on this tour were much younger than previous audiences had been, with many preadolescent children in Kiss makeup with their mothers and fathers (who were sometimes wearing the makeup themselves) in tow at most concerts. Kiss themselves did little to dissuade this new fan base, donning colorful costumes that reinforced a cartoonish image for these younger fans.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 100.</ref>

The fans were unaware of the dissension within the band. One very public indication of the heightened friction within the group was an infamous October 31, 1979, interview on [[Tom Snyder]]'s late-night ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]''. During the episode, a visibly irritated Simmons and Stanley attempted, unsuccessfully, to contain the [[Alcohol intoxication|inebriated]] Frehley, whose frequent laughter and joking overshadowed the conversation between Snyder and the rest of the band. Criss made references to his large gun collection, to the chagrin of Simmons.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 170–171.</ref>

By the end of the ''Dynasty'' tour in December 1979, tensions between Criss and the rest of the band were at an all-time high. His drumming skills had noticeably eroded, and he even intentionally slowed down—or stopped playing altogether—during some concerts. The final show of the tour (December 16, 1979) was the last time Criss performed with the group for almost 17 years, although he remained an official member for nearly six more months.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 97–98.</ref><ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 150–151.</ref>

While Criss appeared on the cover of the next album, ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'', Anton Fig was the actual drummer, although he was not credited. Showcasing a slick, contemporary pop sound, ''Unmasked'' (released May 20, 1980) had the dubious distinction of being the first non-Platinum Kiss album since ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]''. Soon after the album's release, Criss's departure was officially announced.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 109.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 101–102.</ref> Fig, considered a member of Kiss for one day following the departure of Criss, was then fired by Stanley and Simmons, who felt he was not a good fit for the band. He would ultimately join [[Paul Shaffer and the World's Most Dangerous Band]], acting as the drummer for [[David Letterman]]'s television programs until the host's retirement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bnMF7j2nP4 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/3bnMF7j2nP4 |archive-date=December 11, 2021 |url-status=live |title=Kiss Legend Ace Frehley - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?

The band auditioned dozens of replacements for Criss in June 1980. One of the many who auditioned was [[Tico Torres]] (who would later be with [[Bon Jovi]]). They finally settled on a little-known drummer-guitarist-pianist-keyboardist-singer from Brooklyn named Paul Charles Caravello, who adopted the stage name [[Eric Carr]]. His first makeup design was modeled on a hawk, though it was rejected when Stanley and Aucoin saw Carr in the bright yellow costume Kiss had designed for the new drummer.<ref>Symmons, J. (2023). ''The Rise of the Fox: 1950-1982, Eric Carr Revealed, Volume 1, an unauthorized biography,'' p. 42, Spirit of Inquiry. {{ISBN|978-1-7390695-1-3}}</ref> Carr created the "Fox" persona by the middle of July.<ref>Symmons, J.

This was Kiss's only U.S. show in support of ''Unmasked''. On July 30, 1980, Kiss introduced Carr on ABC's ''[[Kids Are People Too!]]'', which would air in September.<ref>Symmons, J. (2023) ''The Rise of the Fox: 1950-1982, Eric Carr Revealed, Volume 1, an unauthorized biography,'' pp. 69–70, Spirit of Inquiry. {{ISBN|978-1-7390695-1-3}}</ref> The band's [[Unmasked Tour|1980 tour]] of Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, was one of the biggest in its history, as they played to sold-out crowds and received overwhelmingly positive press coverage.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 113.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 102.</ref>

For its next album, the band worked again with producer Ezrin, with whom Kiss had found success on ''Destroyer''. Early press reports indicated that the new album would be a return to the hard rock style that had originally brought the band success. However, 1981's ''[[Music from "The Elder"]]'' was a [[concept album]] featuring medieval horns, strings, [[harp]]s, and synthesizers.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 460.</ref>

The album was presented as a soundtrack to a film that was never made, making it difficult to follow the storyline. To make matters worse, having received negative feedback following its record company's preview of the album, Kiss altered the record's track sequence in most countries to emphasize potential singles "The Oath" and "A World Without Heroes", which all but guaranteed the inability of listeners to understand the already-muddled storyline. Once released, fan reaction to ''The Elder'' was harsh; it failed to achieve Gold status and peaked at No. 75 on the ''Billboard'' album chart.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 462–463.</ref>

The band made only two appearances in support of the new album, both in January 1982. One was a performance on the ABC late-night variety program ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', while the second was a lip-synced performance that was broadcast via satellite during Italy's [[Sanremo Music Festival]].<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 117.</ref>

Absent from the satellite performance was Frehley, who had become increasingly frustrated with Kiss's new musical direction. Upset with the band's decision to record ''Music from "The Elder"'', he did not actively participate in the album's creation (despite recording solos on it), providing lead vocals for only one track, "Dark Light". He did not appear at a special concert at [[Studio 54]] in New York City, leaving Kiss to perform as a trio. He recorded his guitar parts at his home studio in [[Wilton, Connecticut]], and mailed them to Ezrin. Another source of frustration for Frehley was that with the departure of Criss, and with Carr not being an equal partner in the band, he was often outvoted 2-to-1 on group decisions. In June 1982, Frehley's departure from the band was negotiated, although he did not officially leave until December.

Simmons stated in his autobiography ''Kiss and Make-Up'' that [[Van Halen]] founder [[Eddie Van Halen]] was eager to replace Frehley as Kiss's lead guitarist. Simmons and Eddie's brother [[Alex Van Halen|Alex]] convinced Eddie to remain with Van Halen.<ref>Simmons, ''Kiss and Make-up'', p. 186.</ref> Eddie was willing to break up Van Halen due to tensions between himself and lead vocalist [[David Lee Roth]], who ultimately left the band in 1985.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 514.</ref><ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 243–244.</ref> Paul Stanley, however, has since denied the rumors of Eddie Van Halen wanting to join Kiss.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Paul Stanley explains the truth about Eddie Van Halen almost joining Kiss |date=November 4, 2018 |url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/paul-stanley-truth-eddie-van-halen-joining-kiss/}}</ref> Other notable guitarists who auditioned to replace Frehley included [[Punky Meadows]] of [[Angel (American band)|Angel]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Prato |first1=Greg |url=http://www.alternativenation.net/guitarist-turned-kiss-aerosmith-new-york-dolls/ |title=The Guitarist Who Turned Down Kiss, Aerosmith & New York Dolls |work=alternativenation.net |date=March 2, 2017 |access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Doug Aldrich]] of [[Whitesnake]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nikas |first1=Sakis |last2=Dolas |first2=Yannis |url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=7391&type=1&lang=EN |title=Interviews - Doug Aldrich |work=rockpages.gr |access-date=April 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426105402/http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=7391&type=1&lang=EN |archive-date=April 26, 2012}}</ref> [[Richie Sambora]] of [[Bon Jovi]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guitar.com/articles/richie-sambora-kiss-reject-pop-rock-hero |title=Richie Sambora - Kiss Reject, Pop Rock Hero |work=guitar.com |access-date=April 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521101015/http://www.guitar.com/articles/richie-sambora-kiss-reject-pop-rock-hero |archive-date=May 21, 2011}}</ref> [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] of [[Guns N' Roses]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wearethepit.com/2023/01/when-slash-almost-joined-kiss/ |title=When Slash Almost Joined Kiss |website=wearethepit.com |date=2023-01-21 |access-date=2023-09-30}}</ref> and a then-unknown [[Yngwie Malmsteen]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Ochoa |first=Hugh |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2010/06/24/malmsteen/ |title=Yngwie Malmsteen Interview: Strats, Shreds and Sweeps |work=guitarinternational.com |access-date=April 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402002803/http://guitarinternational.com/2010/06/24/malmsteen/ |archive-date=April 2, 2011}}</ref>

Soon afterward, Kiss made major changes to its business dealings&nbsp;– chief among them was severing ties with its manager of nine years, Bill Aucoin, and cutting back on its unwieldy organizational tree. Although Frehley had already decided to leave the band, he was pictured on the covers of 1982's ''[[Killers (Kiss album)|Killers]]'' and ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'', although he did not participate in the recording of either album.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 255–256.</ref>
[[File:Kiss, Creatures of the Night (1982).png|thumb|Kiss in 1982. L-R: Ace Frehley, Gene Simmons, Eric Carr, Paul Stanley]]
''Creatures of the Night'' was Kiss's heaviest album to date, and although it fared better than ''Music from "The Elder"'', it peaked at only No. 45 on the charts and was not certified Gold until 1994. In Frehley's absence, Kiss utilized a number of guitarists for the recording of the album, especially [[Vinnie Vincent]], who played on six tracks.

Frehley's last appearance with the band (until the 1996 reunion) was in the music video for the single "[[I Love It Loud]]", which was co-written by Vincent. Frehley also appeared on the cover of the original ''Creatures of the Night'' album artwork. When the album was remixed and re-released in 1985 with a non-makeup cover and a slightly different song order, to reflect the band's roster change and abandonment of its makeup and costumes, Vincent was again absent from the album cover, as then-current lead guitarist, [[Bruce Kulick]], appeared instead.<ref name="Music Legends">{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends |url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/bruce-kulick-interview/ |title=Bruce Kulick Interview |access-date=May 8, 2013 |date=March 14, 2011 |last=Saulnier |first=Jason |archive-date=March 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321101951/http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/bruce-kulick-interview/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> The liner notes accompanying the remixed LP, however, credited both Frehley and Vincent with lead guitar performances on the ''Creatures of the Night'' album. Vincent officially replaced Frehley as lead guitarist in December 1982, as the band embarked on its 10th Anniversary Tour.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 493–495.</ref><ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 118–120.</ref>

Vincent originally wanted to use his birth name (Cusano) in the band, but this was vetoed by Simmons on the grounds that it sounded "too ethnic". Specifically, according to Simmons, "it sounded like a fruit vendor". Simmons went on to note that "fairly or unfairly, rock and roll is about the image".<ref name="Simmons, p. 187">Simmons, ''Kiss and Make-up'', p. 187.</ref> Vincent then suggested the name "Mick Fury", but this was also disallowed. Simmons later suggested the name change to "Vinnie Vincent". Vincent started actively pushing to join Kiss as a full member. Despite the misgivings that both Simmons and Stanley harbored about his personality, Vincent was taken into the band. Stanley designed a character, "the Wiz"<ref name="Simmons, Gene 2001 Page 187">Simmons, Gene (2001). Kiss and Make-Up.

From 1982 to 1983, the new lineup of Kiss became Simmons (the Demon), Stanley (the Starchild), [[Eric Carr]] (the Fox) and Vincent (the Wiz).<ref name="Simmons, Gene 2001 Page 187"/><ref name="Simmons, Gene 2001 Page 192"/>

Vincent's personality did not mesh well with either Stanley or Simmons, and he was dismissed from Kiss at the end of the ''Creatures'' tour. He was quickly reinstated before recording started for ''[[Lick It Up]]'' because Simmons and Stanley could not find a new lead guitarist on such short notice. Vincent appeared on the cover of ''Lick It Up'' and was credited as the lead guitarist. He received a writing credit for eight of the ten songs on the album.

Personality issues arose once again, and Vincent was fired following the ''Lick It Up'' tour, due in part to excessive guitar soloing at a 1984 concert in Quebec. He was replaced by [[Mark St. John]]. Vincent was later utilized by Kiss as a songwriter on the 1992 album ''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'', contributing to the songs "[[Unholy (Kiss song)|Unholy]]", "Heart of Chrome" and "[[I Just Wanna (Kiss song)|I Just Wanna]]". Vincent and the band parted ways. Persistent rumors circulated for years among Kiss fans regarding the true reason for Vincent's dismissals from Kiss, with at least one band member refusing to comment except to say that legally it was not up for discussion. Simmons stated in an interview several years later that Vincent's firing was for "unethical behavior", but he did not elaborate:

{{blockquote|Vinnie, for the record, was fired for unethical behavior, not because of lack of talent.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/GeneSimmonsInterview.html |title=Interview With Gene Simmons |website=Classicbands.com |access-date=August 22, 2011}}</ref>}}

===1983–1996: unmasking===

Sensing it was time for a change, Kiss made the decision to abandon their trademark makeup and costumes. The band officially appeared in public without makeup for the first time since their very early days on a September 18, 1983, appearance on MTV, which coincided with the release of ''[[Lick It Up]]''.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 289.</ref> The tour to promote the new album and the unmasked band members began in Lisbon, Portugal, on October 11, 1983, at Pavilhão Dramático de Cascais, the band's first concert without makeup since early 1973. ''Lick It Up'' became Kiss's first Gold record in three years, but the tour was even more sparsely attended than the previous one. Vincent did not get along with Simmons and Stanley, and he left the band at the conclusion of the tour in March 1984. Vincent's replacement was [[Mark St. John]], a session player and guitar tutor.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 294.</ref>

With St. John, Kiss released the album ''[[Animalize]]'' on September 13, 1984. ''Animalize'' followed the success of ''Lick It Up'', and due in part to consistent MTV play for the "[[Heaven's on Fire]]" video, ''Animalize'' was the band's bestselling record in America during the decade, with over two million albums sold. With the success of the album and subsequent tour, Kiss had recaptured some of its earlier glory (though not to the level of its 1970s heyday). St. John, however, came down with [[reactive arthritis]] during tour rehearsals, and performed at a handful of shows before being dismissed from the band in December 1984, with one of these shows being at the [[Mid-Hudson Civic Center]] in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] which was recorded on November 28, 1984.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wardlaw |first1=Matt |title=Kiss to Release Rare 1984 Mark St. John Show as Next Live Album |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-mark-st-john-live-album/ |website=Ultimateclassicrock.com |date=January 27, 2023 |publisher=Matt Wardlaw}}</ref> The band hired [[Bruce Kulick]] to replace St. John. Kulick had previously filled in for St. John during the first two months of the ''Animalize'' tour. Kulick was Kiss's fourth lead guitarist in less than three years, but he stayed with the band for 12 years.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 139–140.</ref> Kulick became one of the band's longest-serving members, with the longest continuous tenure of anyone other than Simmons and Stanley, until Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer broke his record in 2014 and 2016 respectively.

''End of the Road World Tour Program'', p. 21.</ref>}}

[[File:Kiss (1988).png|thumb|Kiss in 1988. L-R: Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Eric Carr, Bruce Kulick]]

One of the first concerts Kulick played as an official member of the band was at Detroit, Michigan's [[Cobo Hall]]. It was filmed for the MTV special ''[[Animalize Live]]''.

The lineup of Stanley, Simmons, Carr and Kulick turned out to be the most stable since the original, and for the rest of the 1980s, Kiss released a series of Platinum albums: 1985's ''[[Asylum (Kiss album)|Asylum]]'', 1987's ''[[Crazy Nights]]'' and the 1988 greatest hits compilation ''[[Smashes, Thrashes & Hits]]''. ''Crazy Nights'', in particular, was one of Kiss's most successful albums overseas. The single "[[Crazy Crazy Nights]]" reached No. 4 on the singles chart in the United Kingdom, the band's highest-charting single in that country.<ref name="charts">{{cite web |url=http://www.kissfaq.com/charts/scharts.html |title=Singles Chart Action |work=The Kiss FAQ |access-date=July 30, 2006}}</ref>

Kiss ended the decade with the October 1989 release ''[[Hot in the Shade]]''. Although the album failed to achieve Platinum status, it spawned the hit ballad "[[Forever (Kiss song)|Forever]]", co-written by [[Michael Bolton]]. Peaking at No. 8 in the US, it was the group's highest-charting single since "Beth" and was the band's second Top 10 single.<ref name="charts"/>

During this time, Kiss struggled with its identity and fan base. Simmons, arguably the driving force in Kiss during the 1970s, became less involved with the group in the 1980s as he pursued outside interests, most notably a film career. Stanley took a more prominent role as a result.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 311–312.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 360–363.</ref>

In February 1991, the band decided to once again enlist Ezrin to produce its next album. Before recording could begin in earnest, however, tragedy struck. In March 1991, it was discovered that Carr had a [[tumor]] on his heart. It was successfully removed the following month, but more tumors were soon discovered in his lungs. Carr received [[chemotherapy]] and was pronounced cancer-free in July. However, in September he suffered the first of two [[cerebral hemorrhage]]s. He died on November 24, 1991, at the age of 41.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 107.</ref><ref name="carrobit">{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1DE123DF935A15752C1A967958260 |title=Eric Carr, 41, Is Dead; Rock Band's Drummer |date=November 26, 1991 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 16, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Kiss' Gene Simmons: Why We Fired Eric Carr On His Deathbed |url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/kiss-gene-simmons-why-we-fired-eric-carr-on-his-deathbed |website=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=March 29, 2024 |date=November 18, 2002}}</ref>

Despite the tragic loss of a longtime member, Kiss continued, introducing veteran drummer [[Eric Singer]]. Singer had played with Paul Stanley previously, as part of Stanley's backing band during a 1989 solo tour.

Kiss released ''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'' on May 19, 1992. It featured a leaner, harder-edged sound, as indicated by the first single, "[[Unholy (Kiss song)|Unholy]]". In a surprise move, Kiss enlisted Vincent to help with songwriting duties. The album debuted in the Top 10 and went Gold. Kiss embarked on a brief club tour of the U.S. in the spring of 1992, before beginning an American tour in September 1992. The tour was documented on the album ''[[Alive III]]'', released on May 14, 1993. Four days later, Kiss were inducted into [[Guitar Center#Hollywood.27s RockWalk|Hollywood's RockWalk]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockwalk.com/inductees |title=Guitar Center's Hollywood Rockwalk |website=Rockwalk.com |access-date=October 11, 2011 |archive-date=September 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928050734/http://www.rockwalk.com/inductees/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1995, the group released the book ''[[Bibliography of Kiss#Kisstory|Kisstory]]'', a 440-page, {{convert|9|lb|kg}}, detailed chronicle of the group's history to that point. That same year, the band embarked on a unique and well-received Worldwide Kiss Convention Tour. The conventions were all-day events, featuring displays of vintage Kiss stage outfits, instruments and memorabilia; performances by Kiss cover bands; and dealers selling Kiss merchandise from every stage of the band's career. Kiss appeared live at the conventions, conducted question and answer sessions, signed autographs, and performed a two-hour acoustic set composed mostly of spontaneous fan requests. On the first U.S. date (June 17, 1995), Criss appeared onstage with Kiss to sing "Hard Luck Woman" and "Nothin' to Lose". It was the first time Criss had performed publicly with the band in nearly 16 years.<ref name="Sharp, pp. 108">Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 108–110.</ref><ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 217.</ref>

===1996–2001: original lineup reunion tour and remasking===
[[File:Kiss - Utrecht 1997.jpg|thumb|left|Kiss original lineup performing in Utrecht in 1997]]

On August 9, 1995, Kiss joined the long line of musicians to perform on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. The band contacted Criss and Frehley and invited them to participate in the event.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kelley |first1=Ken |title=When Kiss Reunited, Then Went Acoustic, on 'Unplugged' |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-unplugged/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=January 24, 2022 |date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> Both joined Kiss on stage for several songs at the end of the set: "Beth", "2000 Man", "Nothin' to Lose" and "Rock and Roll All Nite".<ref name="Sharp, pp. 108"/> The ''Unplugged'' appearance set off months of speculation that a possible reunion of the original Kiss lineup was in the works. In the weeks following the ''Unplugged'' concert, however, the band (with Kulick and Singer) returned to the studio for the first time in three years to record a follow-up to ''Revenge''. ''[[Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions]]'' was completed in February 1996, but its release was delayed for almost two years. [[Bootleg recording|Bootleg]] copies of the album circulated widely among fans.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 403–404.</ref> While Kiss continued to exist publicly as Simmons, Stanley, Kulick and Singer, arrangements for a reunion of the original lineup were in the works. These efforts culminated with a public event as dramatic as any the band had staged since its 1983 unmasking on MTV. With the following statements, [[Tupac Shakur]] introduced the original Kiss lineup, in full makeup and ''Love Gun''-era stage outfits, to a rousing ovation at the [[38th Annual Grammy Awards]]:<ref name="grammy">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/news_feature_grammyflashback/1996/ |title=Grammy Flashback 1996 |publisher=MTV |access-date=July 30, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020222002510/http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/news_feature_grammyflashback/1996/ |archive-date=February 22, 2002}}</ref>

On April 16, the band members held a press conference aboard the {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|6}} in New York City, where they announced their plans for a full-fledged reunion tour, with the help of new manager [[Doc McGhee]]. The conference, MC'd by [[Conan O'Brien]], was simulcast to 58 countries.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Browne |first1=David |title=Flashback: Kiss and Conan O'Brien Announce the Band's 1996 Reunion |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kiss-reunion-tour-announce-1996-conan-o-brien-1155283/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=April 16, 2021}}</ref> On April 20, nearly 40,000 tickets for the tour's first show sold out in 47 minutes.<ref name="Suhs, p. 224">Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 224.</ref>

The first public concert featuring the newly reunited Kiss was an hour-long warm-up show on June 15 for the annual [[KROQ Weenie Roast]] in [[Irvine, California]], during which the band nearly ignited the stage of the [[Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre (Irvine, California)|Irvine Meadows Amphitheater]].<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 225.</ref> On June 28, the Kiss Alive/Worldwide Tour began at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in Detroit in front of a sold-out crowd of 39,867 fans.

{{blockquote|There were many many nights when I was looking around the stage and going "This is magic." This is beyond anybody's wildest fantasies. What was important about these shows is we had a much bigger task than people understood. Our biggest competition was our history. We didn't have to be as good as we used to be. We had to be as good as people thought we were. The show wasn't to be a replica of what we've done, it was to be what people imagined we had done. We had to be totally committed, and also totally sure that we could not only live up the legend but also surpass it. In terms of the stage show for the reunion tour,  what we wanted to do was look at the '77 show in a sense as a pinnacle. That is what we chose to build on but not copy. There are also elements from other shows too in the sense that there's bombs and the flying rig and the breaking of the guitars. At that time, it was the ultimate Kiss show in the sense that we looked at the show, which we thought was our best and said, "Top this."|Paul Stanley<ref>(2019). ''End of the Road World Tour Program'', p. 29.</ref>}}

[[Image:Kiss 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Kiss performing in Paris on March 21, 1999]]

In September 1998, the reunited group issued ''[[Psycho Circus]]''. Although it was the first album with the original lineup since 1979's ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'', the contributions of Frehley and Criss were minimal. While the images of Frehley and Criss are featured prominently on the album, most of the lead guitar work was later revealed to have been performed by future band member [[Tommy Thayer]]. Former member Kulick made an appearance on the intro of the song "Within". Most drum duties were handled by session musician Kevin Valentine. Despite the controversy, the album achieved a No. 3 chart debut, the highest position for a Kiss album until ''[[Sonic Boom (Kiss album)|Sonic Boom]]'' debuted at No. 2 in 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267069/michael-buble-beats-kiss-on-billboard-200 |title=Michael Buble Beats Kiss On Billboard 200 |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |date=October 14, 2009 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=December 23, 2009}}</ref> The [[Psycho Circus (song)|title track]] received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.<ref name="psychogrammy">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/specials/1999/grammys/bigpicture.html |title=41st annual Grammy nominees and winners |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=July 30, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218161056/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/specials/1999/grammys/bigpicture.html |archive-date=December 18, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Psycho Circus Tour opened at [[Dodger Stadium]] in Los Angeles on Halloween in 1998, and was simulcast on FM radio across the U.S. It proved to be another success, and was historic for being the first to ever incorporate [[Dimension|3D]] visuals into a stage show.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 112, 115.</ref><ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 245.</ref>

On August 11, 1999, Kiss was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], in the "Recording Industry" category. The next month, the group worked in collaboration with [[World Championship Wrestling]] to produce a Kiss-themed wrestler known as [[Dale Torborg|the Demon]], whose face was painted to resemble Simmons's makeup. The group performed "[[God of Thunder (song)|God of Thunder]]" live on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' to debut the character. The band received $500,000 for the one-night, one-song performance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fightingspiritmagazine.co.uk/article.asp?IntID=66 |title=SummerSlam's Jackass angle may have gone up in smoke, but wrestling has flirted with plenty of other celebs&nbsp;... |work=[[Fighting Spirit Magazine]] |access-date=October 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001043901/http://www.fightingspiritmagazine.co.uk/article.asp?IntID=66 |archive-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref>

===2001–2008: post-reunion===
On the eve of the Japanese and Australian leg of the Farewell Tour on January 31, 2001, Criss suddenly left the band once again, because he and the band could not come to agreement with his contract salary. Taking his place was previous Kiss drummer Singer who assumed Criss's Cat persona as the Farewell Tour continued.<ref name="rosen">{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Craig |date=January 31, 2001 |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054736 |title=Peter Criss Leaves Kiss, Eric Singer Steps In |work=Yahoo!

With the band supposedly set to retire by early 2001, a career-encompassing collection entitled simply ''[[The Box Set (Kiss)|The Box Set]]'', consisting of 94 tracks on five CDs, was released in November of that year, while the summer saw perhaps the most outrageous item of Kiss merchandise yet&nbsp;– the [[Kiss Kasket]]. In introducing the Kiss Kasket, Simmons quipped, "I love livin', but this makes the alternative look pretty damn good."<ref name="kasket">{{cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/06_2001/061401.asp |title=Kiss Introduce Their Latest Merchandising Endeavor: The Kiss Kasket |work=NYRock |access-date=July 30, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110055023/http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/06_2001/061401.asp |archive-date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>

On December 4, 2001, Kiss was one of the honorees at the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] ("The Recording Academy") Heroes Award ceremony, at the NARAS New York Chapter. NARAS has 12 chapters throughout the United States, hence 12 ceremonies throughout the year, with the honorees each being honored by the chapter closest to their residence. By receiving this honor, which NARAS has renamed the "Recording Academy Honors", Kiss effectively received NARAS's second-highest career honor, right behind the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046338 |title=Kiss Honored At Heroes Award Event To Benefit N.Y.C.

Kiss was relatively quiet through the rest of the year, but 2002 started with some controversy as Simmons took part in a controversial interview on [[National Public Radio]] with host [[Terry Gross]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/TerryGrossInterviewWithGeneSimmons |title=Terry Gross interview with Gene Simmons |work=Internet Archive |access-date=August 13, 2009}}</ref> In February 2002, Kiss (with Singer on drums and Frehley on lead guitar) performed during the closing ceremony of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wise |first=Mike |date=February 25, 2002 |title=Olympics: Closing Ceremony; Games End With a Mixture Of Rowdy Relief and Joy |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/25/sports/olympics-closing-ceremony-games-end-with-a-mixture-of-rowdy-relief-and-joy.html |access-date=December 22, 2021 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> which was Frehley's final performance as a member of Kiss.

On March 6, 2002, Kiss performed a private concert at a resort in [[Trelawny Parish|Trelawny]], Jamaica. Frehley, who was no longer under contract, did not perform with the group. He was replaced by Thayer, who donned Frehley's Spaceman makeup and costume for his first live appearance with Kiss.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 269.</ref> That month, the band (with Thayer) taped an appearance on the American sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''.<ref name="sitcom">{{cite web |url=http://www.tommythayer.com/about/ |title=About Tommy Thayer |access-date=January 27, 2007 |archive-date=June 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612221217/http://www.tommythayer.com/about/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> The episode, "That '70s Kiss Show", aired in August 2002. Thayer again performed with the group in April 2002, when Kiss performed "Detroit Rock City" (with pre-recorded music and live vocals) for an appearance on ''Dick Clark's American Bandstand 50th Anniversary'' show, which aired on May 3.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 270.</ref>

In February 2003, Kiss traveled to Australia and recorded ''[[Kiss Symphony: Alive IV]]'' with the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Docklands Stadium|Marvel Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Dome) in Melbourne. Thayer once again replaced Frehley, while Criss returned to the group, as one of the conditions set forth by promoters required the band's lineup to include at least three original members.

Despite claims made prior to the Farewell Tour that it would be the group's last, Kiss toured with Aerosmith in 2003.{{sfn|Brod|2020|p=240}} Frehley announced that his departure from the band was permanent, stating that he believed the Farewell Tour would be Kiss's last,<ref>(July 25, 2003).

Simmons and Stanley did not renew Criss's contract when it expired in March 2004. Criss, on his website, stated that "No one, again, no one has called me, or my attorney about an extension for future touring.

After the conclusion of the Rock the Nation Tour, Kiss performed only sporadically for a number of years. The group played two shows in 2005, and another six in 2006. Four of the 2006 shows were July concerts in Japan, including two dates (July 22 and 23) as a headlining act at the 2006 Udo Music Festival. Kiss performed four July 2007 concerts, three of which were dubbed the Hit 'N Run Tour. Prior to the final show on July 27, Stanley was hospitalized with an extremely rapid heartbeat. In his absence, Kiss performed in concert as a trio for the first time since 1982. This was the first Kiss concert that Stanley had missed during his then 34-year tenure with the group.<ref name="hospital">{{Cite news |title=Paul Stanley Hospitalized Prior To California Gig; Kiss Performs As Three-Piece |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/paul-stanley-hospitalized-prior-to-california-gig-kiss-performs-as-three-piece/ |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=July 28, 2007 |access-date=July 28, 2007}}</ref>

Though Kiss had been eligible for enshrinement in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] since 1999, they were not nominated until 2009 and were not inducted until 2014. While this snub displeased some fans, Stanley and Simmons maintained that it was meaningless to them. Nevertheless, a group of about 200 Kiss fans held a protest rally in front of the Hall of Fame in Cleveland on August 5, 2006. It was the first known organized demonstration seeking the induction of a band into the Hall.<ref name="rally">{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060806/ap_en_mu/rock_hall_kiss_fans |title=Kiss fans protest Rock Hall of Fame snub |date=August 6, 2006 |access-date=August 6, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818043349/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060806/ap_en_mu/rock_hall_kiss_fans |archive-date=August 18, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2007, a new comic book series featuring the band was released by the Kiss Comics Group in association with [[Platinum Studios]], titled ''Kiss 4K: Legends Never Die''.

The band picked up their pace in 2008, embarking on their first proper tour of Europe in nearly a decade. On January 30, 2008, Stanley confirmed that Kiss would launch the [[Kiss Alive/35 World Tour]], playing arena and stadium shows in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. On March 16, 2008, Kiss closed the [[Australian Grand Prix]] at [[Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit]] as well as performing in [[Brisbane]] and Sydney as part of this tour. Kiss played at the [[Rock2Wgtn]] two-day festival held in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, on March 22 and 23, 2008; the festival also featured [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Whitesnake]], Poison, Alice Cooper, [[Lordi]], Sonic Altar and Symphony of Screams, with special effects provided by [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] (of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' fame).<ref>{{cite web |date=November 19, 2007 |url=https://www.infonews.co.nz/news.cfm?l=1&t=90&id=9719 |title='Rock2wgtnÃ¢â'¬â"¢ announces the next big name for festival |work=Infonews.co.nz}}</ref>

Three days later, they headlined the [[Arrow Rock Festival]] in [[Nijmegen, Netherlands]]. On June 28, Kiss headlined the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] in [[Dessel]], Belgium. It was the last show of the European leg of the Kiss Alive/35 Tour. On August 4, Kiss played at Rockin' the Rally at the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]] as part of the tour. [[South Dakota]] Governor [[Mike Rounds]] proclaimed August 4, 2008, to be "Kiss Rock and Roll Day" in South Dakota. In September 2008, both Simmons and Stanley confirmed rumors that the Kiss Alive/35 Tour would continue with extensive tours of North America in the beginning of 2009, as well as South America. The latter tour included shows on April 5 in [[Argentina]], April 7 and 8 in Brazil, April 11 in [[Colombia]], April 14 in [[Peru]], and other concerts in [[Venezuela]] and Chile. That summer, Kiss came back to North America to continue the Alive/35 World Tour, starting on July 18 in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]].<ref>{{cite web |date=April 13, 2009 |url=https://caracol.com.co/radio/2009/04/12/nacional/1239494940_793369.html/ |title=Historia presentación de Kiss en Colombia |work=caracol.com.co }}{{Dead link|date=June 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=February 3, 2009 |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kiss-to-play-peru-for-first-time-in-april/ |title=Kiss To Play Peru For First Time In April |work=Blabbermouth.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=February 7, 2009 |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kiss-to-play-venezuela-for-first-time/ |title=Kiss To Play Venezuela For First Time |work=Blabbermouth.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kissonline.com/news/News/184 |title=Kissonline.com |website=Kissonline.com |access-date=October 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928203044/http://www.kissonline.com/news/News/184 |archive-date=September 28, 2011}}</ref>

===2008–2012: ''Sonic Boom'' and ''Monster''===
More than 10 years after their last studio album, and following years of denials about ever wanting to do a new album, Stanley and Simmons changed their minds. In November 2008, Stanley stated to rock photographer [[Ross Halfin]] that a new Kiss album was in the works. Stanley himself would be the producer, and the album would have a "real 70s Kiss sound" to it. Later that month, Simmons and Stanley both publicly confirmed the information about a new Kiss album:

{{blockquote|We have 4 tunes recorded. If you're a fan of our stuff from about 1977, you'll feel right at home. All of us have taken up the songwriting call to arms in the same spirit we once did&nbsp;– without a care in the world and without outside writers. Nothing to prove to anyone. Just doing what comes naturally. Ignoring fashions, trends and with a personal vow from all of us: no rapping. There are plenty of people out there doing this and they don't need four palefaced guys pretending they're from the hood. Besides, I'm not sure how to correctly pronounce 'wassup.' See you all there ... Or maybe later!<ref name="kissonline.com"/>}}

The band appeared on ''[[American Idol]]'' in May 2009, performing "Detroit Rock City" and "Rock and Roll All Nite" with [[Adam Lambert]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1611891/20090520/kiss.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525082209/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1611891/20090520/kiss.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 25, 2009 |title=Adam Lambert Gets Glammed Up With Kiss |last=Montgomery |first=James |date=May 20, 2009 |publisher=MTV |access-date=October 17, 2009}}</ref>

On September 25, 2009, the Kiss Alive/35 North American Tour kicked off at Cobo Hall in Detroit; both nights were filmed for future DVD release. These were the band's final performances there, as the venue was later closed as part of the renovation of the [[Cobo Center]].

Kiss started the European leg of the [[Sonic Boom Over Europe Tour]] in May 2010. Tragedy struck Kiss for a third time when former manager Aucoin died of cancer on June 28, 2010, at the age of 66. Stanley and Simmons said he was like the fifth member of Kiss. The tour included their first UK arena shows in 11 years and their first visit to [[Slovakia]]. Kiss later played at two dates in US cities [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], Wyoming and the [[North Dakota State Fair]] in [[Minot]], North Dakota, in July 2010. They also played at the [[Indiana State Fair]] in August and the [[Minnesota State Fair]] in September. They also made a brief appearance at the [[Saratoga Performing Arts Center]] in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], on August 17, 2010. On July 23, Kiss started [[The Hottest Show on Earth Tour]] in the United States.

On April 13, 2011, Kiss began recording a new album due for release later in the year.<ref name="18april2011"/> Simmons stated, the album "is gonna be the next step to ''Sonic Boom''.

Simmons said: "Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. You press this button, you don't have to do anything. But analog is the love of your life. You can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible. You need tubes, electricity and thick wood to make that thick sound."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-going-retro-for-monster-recording-sessions/ |title=Kiss Going Retro for 'Monster' Recording Sessions |work=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=November 3, 2011 |access-date=November 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kissonline.com/news?n_id=51488 |title=Kiss Online :: News |website=Kissonline.com|date=December 4, 2024}}</ref>

There had been conflicting stories regarding whether Kiss would record another album. Simmons had said "yes" in interviews, saying that he had songs written and lined up for a new album.

===Makeup designs===
The band is famous for its iconic makeup designs, each of which represents a different character or persona. The original four designs consisted of: the "Starchild", the "Demon", the "Spaceman", and the "Catman". The band formerly included a practice of giving any new members a new persona, such as "the Fox" for Carr and "the Ankh Warrior" for Vincent; this practice was ended after Thayer and Singer took up Frehley's "Spaceman" and Criss's "Catman" personas respectively. When asked on the matter, Simmons stated "Why wouldn't we use the classic makeup? We own it". Criss relinquished his rights to his makeup when he left the band in 2004, which he later regretted, saying "I'm pissed at myself that my makeup slipped through my hands", while Frehley claims he licensed his design to the band and would get it back, a notion which Stanley has called "a fantasy".<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/gene-simmons-on-kiss-makeup-controversy-why-wouldnt-we-use-it-164306/ |title=Gene Simmons Talks Kiss Makeup Controversy |first1=Kory |last1=Grow |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

During 1973–74, Stanley occasionally used an alternative makeup design called the "Bandit" for select photo-shoots and live shows after [[Neil Bogart]], head of Casablanca Records, suggested to him that he use a design that was symmetrical like those of the rest of the band. During this time, he was also still using the Starchild makeup—sometimes even using both designs at the same photo-shoots. In 1974, he stopped using the Bandit design permanently. On the cover of the band's debut album, Criss used a drastically different variation of his Catman makeup (dubbed the "Pantomime Cat") after he allowed the makeup artist at the shoot to use their own ideas instead of following the usual design. Carr was originally going to be the "Hawk", a design which Simmons recalled in his autobiography looked like [[Big Bird]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]''. One photo of Carr wearing this proposed design exists today, and also one of a mannequin Stanley set up wearing the proposed makeup and outfit. Unlike the Bandit and Pantomime Cat, this alternative design was never used in any official capacity. The Hawk design was also considered for Vincent and Singer.<ref>"[http://metaltalk.net/columns_eighteen/chris_dale_undiscovered_kisstory_alternative_makeup.php/metaltalk.net/columns_eighteen/chris_dale_undiscovered_kisstory_alternative_makeup.php Undiscovered Kisstory: Alternative Makeup Designs"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702053035/http://metaltalk.net/columns_eighteen/chris_dale_undiscovered_kisstory_alternative_makeup.php/metaltalk.net/columns_eighteen/chris_dale_undiscovered_kisstory_alternative_makeup.php |date=July 2, 2019}} at Metaltalk.net</ref>
Contrary to a false belief spread among the fan community of the band ("The Ankh Warrior"), the official name for Vincent's persona is "The Wiz", as per his contract, press releases for the ''Creatures of the Night'' tour, magazine interviews, and Simmons's autobiography.<ref name="Simmons, Gene 2001 Page 187"/><ref name="Simmons, Gene 2001 Page 192"/>

St. John and Kulick were members of Kiss only during the non-makeup period. Kulick stated that had he ever worn makeup in the band, he would have liked to have been the "Dog": "I figure that since there's already a cat in the band, I should probably be the dog. I'd have a big circle around one eye and I'd look like Petey from the ''[[Our Gang|Little Rascals]]''. I've actually seen one or two fan renditions of what that might look like, so yeah, I'd be the dog." The four original makeup designs have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with ownership and licensing rights held by Kiss Catalog, Inc (now owned by Pophouse).<ref>[https://wmmr.com/2024/04/04/kiss-catalog-name-logo-makeup-sold/ "Kiss Catalog, Name, Logo, Makeup Rights Sold in 9-Figure Deal"], WMMR Rock News</ref>

There is  debate over whether Kiss copied the Brazilian group [[Secos & Molhados]] in adopting their iconic face paint and this has been a topic of discussion among fans and media. Secos & Molhados, formed in 1971, were known for their extravagant costumes and face paint, debuting their self-titled album in August 1973. Kiss, emerging from New York's glam scene, began performing with their distinctive makeup in early 1973, releasing their debut album in February 1974. While some suggest that Kiss may have been influenced by Secos & Molhados, the timeline indicates that both bands developed their styles independently around the same period. Gene Simmons of Kiss has dismissed claims of copying, comparing them to unfounded legends.

In the broader context of rock history, face paint has been utilized by various artists prior to both bands. Performers like [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]] and [[Alice Cooper]] in the 1960s and early 1970s incorporated face paint into their acts, contributing to the theatricality of rock performances.

While both Secos & Molhados and Kiss employed distinctive face paint and theatrical elements in their performances, the evidence suggests that these similarities arose independently, influenced by the broader trends in the rock and glam scenes of the early 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Redação |title=Afinal, o Kiss copiou o Secos e Molhados para criar suas máscaras? |url=https://rollingstone.com.br/noticia/afina-o-kiss-copiou-o-secos-e-molhados-para-criar-suas-mascaras/ |access-date=2025-02-16 |website=Rolling Stone Brasil |language=pt-br}} </ref>

==Legacy==
The world of concert touring was changed by Kiss's practice of erecting uniquely designed stage sets. Tours got larger, carrying more personnel and equipment, including sets, costumes, sound and lighting gear, and pyrotechnics, all requiring more trucking and the total cost increasing by millions of dollars. Kiss also innovated with a significant expansion of concert merchandising, selling non-musical [[Kiss merchandising|Kiss-branded goods]] to concertgoers. The sales of merchandise helped pay for the concert expenses and bring a profit to the band as well as give them more of a presence without relying solely on radio. Other bands copied Kiss by selling their own branded goods at concerts, a practice which became more of a necessity in the 1980s with increasing costs of touring.<ref name=Konow2009/><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/02/music-wont-pay-the-band/ |title=Music Won't Feed The Band – But Merch Might |last=Van Buskirk |first=Eliot |date=February 23, 2010 |magazine=Wired |access-date=May 28, 2015}}</ref> In addition to concert merchandising, Kiss has extended its influence to include a full Kiss-themed mini-golf course at the [[Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino|Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino]] in Las Vegas, Nevada.<ref>{{cite news |last=Blabbermouth |date=February 1, 2016 |title='Kiss By Monster Mini Golf' Moving To Rio All-Suite Hotel And Casino In Las Vegas |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kiss-by-monster-mini-golf-moving-to-rio-all-suite-hotel-and-casino-in-las-vegas/ |access-date=July 18, 2020 |website=Blabbermouth.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=June 19, 2019 |title=The wackiest and wildest mini-golf courses in Las Vegas |url=https://www.ktnv.com/positivelylv/the-wackiest-and-wildest-mini-golf-courses-in-las-vegas |access-date=July 18, 2020 |website=KTNV}}</ref>
