'''Creed''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Tallahassee, Florida]] formed in 1994. Creed was prominent in the [[post-grunge]] movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, releasing three consecutive [[Music recording certification|multi-platinum]] albums; ''[[Human Clay]]'' (1999), the band's second studio album, received [[RIAA certification|diamond (11× platinum)]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Creed has sold over 28 million records in the United States,<ref>{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Jonathan |date=December 1, 2008 |title=Rock act Creed in talks to reunite |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE4B08WX20081201 |access-date=June 30, 2017 |archive-date=May 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530064125/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE4B08WX20081201 |url-status=live }}</ref> has sold over 53 million albums worldwide,<ref>{{cite web |date=February 11, 2014 |title=Creed's Scott Stapp: From Ruin To Redemption |url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2014/2/11/269389/Creed-s-Scott-Stapp-From-Ruin-To-Redemption.aspx |work=chattanoogan.com |access-date=October 2, 2015 |archive-date=October 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004034812/http://www.chattanoogan.com/2014/2/11/269389/Creed-s-Scott-Stapp-From-Ruin-To-Redemption.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref> and was the ninth best-selling musical act of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yahoo Top 20 sellers of the 2000s |url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-extra-the-top-20-album-sellers-of-the-2000s.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115034358/http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-extra-the-top-20-album-sellers-of-the-2000s.html |archive-date=January 15, 2012 |publisher=YahooMusic}}</ref>

For most of its existence, the band has consisted of lead vocalist [[Scott Stapp]], lead guitarist [[Mark Tremonti]], drummer [[Scott Phillips (musician)|Scott Phillips]], and bassist [[Brian Marshall]]. Creed's first two studio albums, ''[[My Own Prison]]'' (1997) and ''Human Clay'' (1999), were released to commercial success despite generally unfavorable critical reception; Marshall left the band in 2000. ''Human Clay'' contained the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single "[[With Arms Wide Open]]", which also won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]] in 2001. The band's third album, ''[[Weathered]]'', was released in 2001, with Tremonti on bass guitar. Creed disbanded in 2004; Stapp pursued a solo career while Tremonti, Phillips, and Marshall founded the band [[Alter Bridge]] with [[Myles Kennedy]].

Creed reunited in 2009, released their fourth album ''[[Full Circle (Creed album)|Full Circle]]'' that year and toured before going dormant once again in 2012. After an eleven-year hiatus, Creed reunited once more in July 2023 and subsequently announced headlining tours in 2024 and 2025.

==History==
===Early years (1994–1996)===
[[file:Scott Stapp 2016 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Founding member, vocalist [[Scott Stapp]] (pictured in 2016)]]

After multiple discussions and much time spent writing songs, several of which addressed themes of [[Christianity|Christian theology]] and spirituality (due to Stapp's spiritual background as the stepson of a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] minister), the duo held auditions that led to the recruitment of bassist [[Brian Marshall]], drummer [[Scott Phillips (musician)|Scott Phillips]], and rhythm guitarist Brian Brasher completing the quintet. The five-piece band lasted through 1994, with Brasher leaving in 1995. Creed decided to remain as a quartet. The four musicians had already written and collaborated on four songs that would form part of their chart-topping debut album, ''[[My Own Prison]]''. The band found local success, playing shows in bars and small dives in Tallahassee. In 2012, Stapp wrote that Creed first performed under the name "Naked Toddler" at Yianni's in Tallahassee; the name was picked up by Tremonti from a headline in that day's newspaper, but the reaction that night to the name was negative. The group was trying to find ideas for a better name when Marshall said he had been in a band called Mattox Creed. Stapp latched onto the ‘creed’ aspect, and the band agreed.<ref name="Stapp 2012"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNTO2orJs3I| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211103/GNTO2orJs3I| archive-date=November 3, 2021 | url-status=live|title=Creed's Scott Stapp - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?| website=[[YouTube]]|date=February 3, 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===''My Own Prison'' and rise to fame (1997–1998)===
Wanting "a real show at a club", they managed to persuade the owner of a bar in Tallahassee to book them by claiming that they could guarantee an audience of 200 people.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite interview |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Joel_Mark_Interview.html |title= Interview With Joel Mark |publisher= | work= [[HitQuarters]] |first= Joel| last= Mark| date=October 9, 2000| interviewer=  Luci Vazquez |access-date= October 19, 2011 |archive-date= September 27, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154404/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Joel_Mark_Interview.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Owner and manager [[Jeff Hanson (music executive)|Jeff Hanson]] recalled that the band had played mostly cover versions, but two original songs stood out and impressed him so much that he promptly signed them to his management and promotions company and set about developing their act.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite interview| first= Jeff | last=Hanson | interviewer= Jan Blumentrath | url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Jeff_Hanson_Interview.html |title=Interview With Jeff Hanson |publisher= | website= HitQuarters |date= September 13, 2010 |access-date= October 5, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170904051946/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Jeff_Hanson_Interview.html |archive-date= September 4, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For their first recordings he matched the band up with [[John Kurzweg]], a producer and friend of Hanson's who he felt was an appropriate fit. Together they recorded their debut album for $6,000, which was funded by Hanson.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> The album, titled ''[[My Own Prison]]'', was initially self-released on their own label, Blue Collar Records in April 1997, selling 6,000 copies throughout Florida.

''My Own Prison'' had been circulating around the music industry for a while when, in May 1997, [[Diana Meltzer]] from [[Wind-up Records|Wind-Up Records]] heard the album and decided almost immediately that she wanted to sign them to the label,<ref name= "hitquarters3">{{cite interview |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Diana_Meltzer_int.html |title= Interview With Diana Meltzer | first= Diana | last= Meltzer | interviewer= Stefan Sörin |publisher= | website= HitQuarters |date= July 7, 2003 |access-date=October 19, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110908185725/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Diana_Meltzer_int.html |archive-date= September 8, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which had creative issues with [[Baboon (band)|Baboon]] over the latter's reluctance to alter their image and sound to suit the label's demands. Meltzer later said that she heard "an arena band".<ref name="hitquarters3" /> Within the same week, Meltzer, together with Wind-up president Steve Lerner, CEO [[Alan Meltzer]], and [[artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative Joel Mark, flew to Tallahassee to see Creed perform live and decide for certain whether to offer them a contract. "Seeing the energy in the room when Scott Stapp stepped up to the mic, and hearing his powerful voice fill the room, alongside Mark Tremonti's now legendary guitar riffs and that big Creed anthemic rock sound, was all I needed," she told HitQuarters.<ref name="hitquarters3" /> According to Tremonti in his "Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction" video in 2015, Creed had been rejected by Atlantic and Cherry Universal Records before Wind-up flew down to sign them.<ref name="p883">{{cite web | last=Schaffner | first=Lauryn | title=Creed Play 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?' | website=Loudwire | date=April 18, 2024 | url=https://loudwire.com/creed-wikipedia-fact-fiction/ | access-date=June 21, 2024}}</ref> The band signed with Wind-up Records in 1997.
[[file:Brian Marshall from Creed.jpg|thumb|upright|Bassist [[Brian Marshall]]]]
''My Own Prison'' was remixed, given a more radio-friendly sound, and re-released by Wind-up Records in August 1997. Four singles were released from the album: "[[My Own Prison (song)|My Own Prison]]", "Torn", "[[What's This Life For]]", and "[[One (Creed song)|One]]". Each of these songs reached No.&nbsp;1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, making Creed the first band to accomplish such a feat with a debut album.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> With little [[MTV]] exposure, media coverage, or label support, ''My Own Prison'' sold extremely well, moving over six million copies and going six times [[RIAA certification|platinum]]. Creed continued to top year-end charts and was recognized as the Rock Artist of the Year at the 1998 [[Billboard Music Award]]s. ''My Own Prison'' was also the highest-selling heavy music record of 1998 on [[Nielsen SoundScan]]'s Hard Music chart.<ref name="creedfeed">{{cite web |url=http://www.creedfeed.com/band/ |title=Creed Bio |publisher=| website= CreedFeed.com |access-date=February 28, 2013 |archive-date=March 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303211439/http://creedfeed.com/band/ |url-status= live }}</ref> The band's hit song "My Own Prison" was also featured as a live performance on the charity album ''[[Live in the X Lounge]]'' in 1998. The band covered [[Alice Cooper]]'s song "[[I'm Eighteen]]" for ''[[The Faculty]]'' soundtrack in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/songs/creed/646500 |title=Creed |publisher=[[Artistdirect]] |access-date= February 4, 2011 |archive-date= January 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128044344/http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/songs/creed/646500 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Critical reception toward ''My Own Prison'' was mostly favorable. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]] gave it four out of five stars and said that Creed "work well within their boundaries" despite "basically [falling] into the category of post-Seattle bands who temper their grunge with a dose of [[Live (band)|Live]] earnestness."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/my-own-prison-r307727 |title=My Own Prison&nbsp;– Creed |website=[[AllMusic]] |first=Stephen Thomas | last= Erlewine |access-date= February 28, 2013 |archive-date=March 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314091112/http://www.allmusic.com/album/my-own-prison-r307727 |url-status=live }}</ref> The album lyrically deals with themes of questioning and struggling with faith and [[spirituality]].

===''Human Clay'' and Marshall's departure (1999–2000)===
With money made from ''My Own Prison'', the band started to write for their second album, ''[[Human Clay]]''. The album's first single, "[[Higher (Creed song)|Higher]]", spent a record-breaking 17 weeks on the top of the rock radio charts.<ref name="allmusic.com" /><ref name="higher">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4642080-1.html |title=Creed Goes "higher' In The Record Books |first=Mark |last= Marone |magazine=Billboard |date= January 21, 2000 |access-date=February 28, 2013 |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824163510/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4642080-1.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2009, "Higher" was ranked as the 95th greatest hard rock song of all time by [[VH1]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stereogum.com/43591/vh1s_100_greatest_hard_rock_songs/list/ |title=VH1's 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs |date=January 5, 2009 |publisher=| website= Stereogum.com |access-date= February 28, 2013 |archive-date=July 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120717180122/http://stereogum.com/43591/vh1s_100_greatest_hard_rock_songs/list/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The album was released in 1999, when ''My Own Prison'' was still doing reasonably well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/creed/biography/ |title=Creed Biography |first=Steve |last=Huey |publisher=[[Yahoo!

The first three singles topped radio charts, giving Creed a total of seven chart-topping singles.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> The band would later go on to win a [[Grammy Award]] for "With Arms Wide Open" for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] in 2001.<ref name="grammy">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/news_feature_grammy01/grammy01frame.html |title=2001 Grammy Winners |publisher=MTV |access-date= February 4, 2011 |archive-date=November 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106162455/http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/news_feature_grammy01/grammy01frame.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Reviews for ''Human Clay'' were largely positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from [[AllMusic]] said that the record "does make it clear that there is an audience for post-grunge hard rock, as long as it's delivered without pretension and as long as it meets the audience's desire for straight-ahead, hard-hitting music."<ref name="AM">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/human-clay-r429719/review |title=Human Clay&nbsp;– Creed |website=AllMusic | first=Stephen Thomas | last= Erlewine |access-date= February 28, 2013 |archive-date= March 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315101308/http://www.allmusic.com/album/human-clay-r429719/review |url-status=live }}</ref> The lyrical content of ''Human Clay'' is a slight departure from that of ''My Own Prison'', touching on subjects such as fatherhood ("With Arms Wide Open") and [[lucid dream]]ing ("Higher"), as well as darker, more violent themes such as [[sexual abuse]] ("Wash Away Those Years") and [[hostility]] ("What If").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.passionbreedsfollowers.com/media/print/areviews/gtm.shtml |title=Creed&nbsp;– Human Clay |publisher= Passion Breeds Followers |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715050840/http://www.passionbreedsfollowers.com/media/print/areviews/gtm.shtml |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref>

In March 2000, an authorized home video about Creed was announced on the band's website, but never released.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.creednet.com/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000302000906/http://www.creednet.com/ | archive-date=March 2, 2000 | title=The official website of Creed}}</ref> During the summer of 2000, bassist Brian Marshall began a spiral into [[alcoholism]]. The band had a meeting with management to discuss Marshall's future. Stapp and Tremonti supported the idea of Marshall going to rehab and attempted to talk Marshall into going, but he refused. Initially, the public thought Marshall was let go because he criticized [[Pearl Jam]] frontman [[Eddie Vedder]] in a radio interview with [[KNDD]] in June 2000, claiming that Scott Stapp was a better songwriter, and criticized Pearl Jam's recent albums for "having songs without [[Hook (music)|hooks]]."<ref>{{cite web|first1=David|last1=Basham|title=Creed Bassist Disses Pearl Jam in Radio Interview| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1427593/creed-bassist-disses-pearl-jam-in-radio-interview/| publisher= | website = MTV.com |date=June 19, 2000|access-date=December 1, 2014|archive-date=November 8, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141108135241/http://www.mtv.com/news/1427593/creed-bassist-disses-pearl-jam-in-radio-interview/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Stapp later distanced the rest of the band from Marshall's comments and stated, "Yes, we get tired of the PJ question, but there is no excuse for the arrogance and stupidity [of Marshall]. I ask you all not to judge Creed as a band, because the statements made were not the band's feelings, they were Brian's. I'm sorry if Brian offended anyone, and he has already apologized for his comments."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.real.com/music/genre/Christian_Rock/articles/375445/-related-articles-page-5/|title=Christian Rock - Christian/Gospel - Music |website= uk.real.com |date=March 2, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302212304/http://uk.real.com/music/genre/Christian_Rock/articles/375445/-related-articles-page-5/|access-date=August 21, 2021|archive-date=March 2, 2010}}</ref> Tremonti and Stapp were concerned for Marshall and their collective friendships, but soon after the controversy, Marshall formed a new band called Grand Luxx with his old Mattox Creed bandmates.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> Stapp stated that Marshall's leaving was his choice and was unrelated to the Pearl Jam comments.<ref name="scott stapp interview mtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/s/stapp_scott/news_feature_080904/index2.jhtml |title=Scott Stapp Breaks His Silence |first=Joe |last=D'Angelo |website=MTV.com |date= August 9, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814024301/http://www.mtv.com/bands/s/stapp_scott/news_feature_080904/index2.jhtml |archive-date=August 14, 2004 }}</ref> [[Brett Hestla]], from the band [[Virgos Merlot]], replaced Marshall as a touring member of Creed.

Creed worked on their third album for most of 2001, with Tremonti choosing to play bass on the record to "[preserve] the band's initial core," although Hestla remained in Creed's touring lineup. ''[[Weathered]]'' was released on November 20, 2001. Six singles were released from the album: "[[My Sacrifice]]" (which earned the band a nomination for a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] in 2003), "[[Bullets (Creed song)|Bullets]]", "[[One Last Breath (Creed song)|One Last Breath]]", "[[Hide (Creed song)|Hide]]", "[[Don't Stop Dancing]]", and "[[Weathered (song)|Weathered]]".

This, along with other events, led to a controversial concert on December 29, 2002, at the [[Allstate Arena]] in [[Rosemont, Illinois]], which ultimately led to the band's disunion.

Creed disbanded in June 2004, after more than a year of inactivity. Tremonti cited tensions between Stapp and the rest of the band as the reasoning. He said that the relationship with Stapp had become so strained that the creative juices were no longer flowing. The reality was that Stapp was in [[Maui]] battling his addiction to alcohol and drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488149/creed-have-been-split-up-months.jhtml |title=Creed Break Up: Mark Tremonti blames tensions between band, singer Scott Stapp. |publisher= | website= MTV.com |first=Joe |last=D'Angelo |date=June 4, 2004 |access-date=February 28, 2013 |archive-date=March 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321072516/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488149/creed-have-been-split-up-months.jhtml |url-status=dead }}</ref> Almost simultaneous with the announcement of Creed's break-up, Stapp opted for a solo career.

According to a 1999 piece in ''[[The Washington Post]]'':<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-09/28/010r-092899-idx.html|title=Creed's True Calling|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427213543/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-09/28/010r-092899-idx.html|access-date=August 21, 2021|archive-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref>
<blockquote>The biblical imagery of singer Scott Stapp's lyrics got Creed typed as Christian rock by early listeners, and the band's denial of any religious objective has unsettled some of its more fervent fans. "We are not a Christian band," Stapp insists on the band's website. "A Christian band has an agenda to lead others to believe in their specific religious beliefs. We have no agenda!"</blockquote>
In 2022, Stapp said in an interview,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zce4lSBWPoM&t=2309s|title=Scott Stapp {{!}} This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von #412|website=[[YouTube]] | date=October 11, 2022}}</ref>
<blockquote>I knew I couldn't live the life that someone who was a Christian artist was supposed to live. So Creed was not a Christian band. [...] They didn't want to live with that pressure. And that burden that was not something they signed up for. They signed up to be in a rock and roll band and everything that came with it. [...] I went to the complete polar opposite of what a preacher is, but still, in my writings, could not escape what I knew was right or what I felt was right, and that is to point people to God, to point people to something greater, to point people to a spiritual life in a spiritual realm, which I knew was real, which I had felt as a child, and I've felt on stage thousands of times and continued to, to this day.</blockquote>
Bassist Brian Marshall, who named the band, has noted that Stapp uses spiritual imagery as a [[metaphor]] in his lyrics.<ref name="ny rock">{{cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/creed_int.htm |title=Interview with Creed (NY Rock) |website=Nyrock.com|date=May 1999 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526075050/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/creed_int.htm |archive-date=May 26, 2011 }}</ref>
