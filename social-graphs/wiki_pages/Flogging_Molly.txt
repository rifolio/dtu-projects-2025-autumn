'''Flogging Molly''' is an Irish-American seven-piece [[Celtic punk]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1997, led by Irish vocalist [[Dave King (singer)|Dave King]], formerly of the hard rock band [[Fastway (band)|Fastway]]. They are signed to their own [[record label]], Borstal Beat Records.

==History==
===Early years===
Prior to forming Flogging Molly, [[Dublin]]-born Dave King was the lead singer for the heavy metal band [[Fastway (band)|Fastway]] featuring guitarist [[Eddie Clarke (musician)|"Fast" Eddie Clarke]] of Motörhead in the early to mid-[[1980s in music|1980s]]. He later fronted a hard rock band called Katmandu (1991), featuring [[Mandy Meyer]] of [[Krokus (band)|Krokus]] and [[Asia (band)|Asia]] on guitars. Afterward, King retained a record deal with [[Epic Records]] and began to work on a solo album, but began to reconsider his record deal when the label opposed his idea of bringing in traditional Irish instruments. King negotiated out of his record deal to go his own way musically soon after.

In 1993, King met [[violin]] player Bridget Regan, guitarist [[Ted Hutt]], bassist Jeff Peters and drummer [[Paul Crowder]],<ref name="floggingmolly.com">[http://www.floggingmolly.com Life Is Good Out Now]. Floggingmolly.com, Retrieved on March 13, 2020.</ref> and put together a rock band with a [[Celtic music]] influence. They began to play a mix of Irish traditional and rock music. Putting King's poetic lyrics to rocking melodies, they played weekly at a Los Angeles pub called Molly Malone's, building a small but loyal following. Together, they wrote songs such as "Black Friday Rule" and "Selfish Man", which was the beginning of Flogging Molly's sound. Ted and Jeff then left Flogging Molly because an earlier band of theirs, Reacharound, received a record deal. King and Regan began to find new members and the current band was formed.

They continued a routine of playing every Monday night at Molly Malone's. They put out a live album, ''[[Alive Behind the Green Door]]'', in 1997. In an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine, King stated that the band's name comes from the bar (Molly Malone's) that faithfully supported the band from the very beginning, "We used to play there every Monday night and we felt like we were flogging it to death, so we called the band Flogging Molly." They were signed onto [[SideOneDummy Records]] after a show when the record company's owners attended a concert and noted their intensity.

===Career===
The band’s debut studio album,'' [[Swagger (Flogging Molly album)|Swagger]]'', arrived on March 7, 2000, their first of many with [[SideOneDummy]]. They joined the Vans Warped Tour for the first time that summer alongside [[Green Day]], [[Weezer]], and [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]] (whom they continued touring alongside in the fall).<ref name="Wikipedia">{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Warped_Tour_lineups_by_year |title=List of Warped Tour lineups by year |publisher=Wikipedia |access-date=January 25, 2024}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2024}}

==Musical style==
Flogging Molly's music is influenced by various artists, such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Pogues]], [[Horslips]], [[Johnny Cash]], and [[The Clash]]. The album ''[[Within a Mile of Home]]'' (2004) is dedicated to the memories of Cash and The Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]].{{fact|date=July 2023}}

Their music ranges from boisterous Celtic punk, like the pirate-themed "Salty Dog", "Cruel Mistress", and "Seven Deadly Sins", or the defiant "What's Left of the Flag", "Drunken Lullabies", and "Rebels of the Sacred Heart", to more somber songs like "Far Away Boys", "The Son Never Shines (On Closed Doors)", "Life in a Tenement Square", and "Float". Lyrics typically touch on subjects such as Ireland and its history, drinking, poverty, politics, love, and death and include several references to the [[Catholic Church]]. "What's Left of the Flag" and "The Likes of You Again" were written as tributes to King's father, who died when King was a child.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://intunemusiconline.com/2009/07/27/warped-tour-oceanport-719/ |title = inTuneMusic Online: Warped Tour @ Oceanport 7/19 |access-date=2009-07-28 |last=Ambrose |first=Anthony |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120529174420/http://intunemusiconline.com/2009/07/27/warped-tour-oceanport-719/ |archive-date=2012-05-29 |date=2009-07-27 }}</ref>
