'''The Jam''' were <!-- This article is written is British English, which colloquially treats collective nouns as plural. See WP:ENGVAR for more info. --> an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1972 in [[Woking]], [[Surrey]], consisting of [[Paul Weller]], [[Bruce Foxton]] and [[Rick Buckler]]. They released 18 consecutive top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to their break-up in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, "[[That's Entertainment (The Jam song)|That's Entertainment]]" and "[[Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?]]" remain the best-selling import singles of all time in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

When the group disbanded in 1982, their first 15 singles were re-released and all placed within the top 100.<ref name=":2" />

The band drew upon a variety of stylistic influences over the course of their career, including 1970s [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] and 1960s [[beat music]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. The trio were known for their melodic pop songs, their distinctly English take on social commentary, and their [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] image. The band launched the career of Paul Weller, who went on to form [[the Style Council]] and later started a solo career. Weller wrote and sang most of the Jam's original compositions and played lead guitar, using a [[Rickenbacker 330]]. [[Bruce Foxton]] provided backing vocals and prominent basslines, which were the foundation of many of the band's songs, including the hits "[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]", "[[The Eton Rifles]]", "[[Going Underground]]" and "[[Town Called Malice]]".

==History==
===Formation (1972–1976)===
[[File:Rickenbacker 330JG.jpg|upright=.69|thumb|A [[Rickenbacker 330]]. Weller frequently recorded and performed live with the Jam using this instrument.]]

The Jam formed at [[Sheerwater Secondary School]] in [[Woking]], Surrey, England, in 1972. The line-up consisted of [[Paul Weller]] on bass and lead vocals,<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in The Jam'' {{ISBN|978-1-783-05794-8}} p. 33</ref> with various friends. The name 'The Jam' was reportedly suggested by Weller's sister, Nicky.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Furber |last2=Lo |first2=Hsin-Yi |first1=Simon |title='The Modfather is my little toad of a brother' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3ryz6l6j8o |website=[[BBC News]] |access-date=14 July 2025 |date=6 July 2025}}</ref> They played their first gigs at Michael's, a local club. The line-up began to solidify in the mid-1970s with Weller, guitarist/vocalist Steve Brookes and drummer [[Rick Buckler]]. In their early years, their sets consisted of covers of early American [[rock and roll]] songs by the likes of [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]]. They continued in this vein until Weller discovered the Who's debut album ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' and became fascinated with [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] music. As he said later, "I saw that through becoming a Mod it would give me a base and an angle to write from, and this we eventually did. We went out and bought suits and started playing [[Motown]], [[Stax Records|Stax]] and [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] covers. I bought a [[Rickenbacker]] guitar, a [[Lambretta (motorscooter)|Lambretta]] GP 150 and tried to style my hair like [[Steve Marriott]]'s circa '66."<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web |url=http://underground-network.de/weller.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over ska musik.

===Early recordings (1977)===
On 29 April 1977, Polydor released the Jam's debut single, "[[In the City (The Jam song)|In the City]]", which charted in the Top 40 in the UK.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam,'' p. 65.</ref> On 20 May, the band released their debut album [[In the City (The Jam album)|of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/19770522/7502/|title=Official Albums Chart Top 60 |website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=12 November 2017}}</ref> The album, like those of [[the Clash]] and [[Sex Pistols]], featured fast, loud and pointed songs. What set it apart from the records of those two bands was its more prevalent 1960s rock influences. The Jam covered [[Larry Williams]]'s "[[Slow Down (Larry Williams song)|Slow Down]]" (also covered by [[the Beatles]]) and the [[Batman Theme|theme song]] of the 1960s TV series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam,'' p. 66.</ref>

On 1 May 1977, the Jam joined the Clash's White Riot Tour as an opening act, alongside the [[Buzzcocks]], [[the Slits]], [[Subway Sect]], and [[the Prefects]] at [[Guildford Civic Hall]] and concluded the tour on 30 May 1977 at the 	[[California Ballroom]]	in [[Dunstable]].<ref name=Riot>{{cite web|first=Tim|last=Card|title=On This Day In 1977: The 'White Riot Tour' kicked of at the Roxy in London with The Clash, The Jam and The Buzzcocks.|url=https://blog.eil.com/2016/05/01/on-this-day-in-1977-the-white-riot-tour-kicked-of-at-the-roxy-in-london-with-the-clash-the-jam-and-the-buzzcocks/|publisher=Eil.com|date=1 May 2016|accessdate=30 December 2023}}</ref>

The Jam had political lyrics, condemning [[police brutality]] ("In the City") and expansionist development ("Bricks and Mortar"). One of their most openly political songs, "Time for Truth", bemoaned the decline of the [[British Empire]] and expressed disparaging sentiments about "Uncle Jimmy" (the Prime Minister, [[James Callaghan]]) in no uncertain terms ("Whatever happened to the great Empire?" / "I think it's time for truth, and the truth is you lost, Uncle Jimmy"). These pro-Empire sentiments and ostentatious displays of the [[Union Flag]] began to earn the group the tag of "[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]".<ref name=SLATE>{{cite web |author=David Weigel |title=Margaret Thatcher vs. Pop Culture|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/04/british-musicians-really-hated-margaret-thatcher.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|SLATE]] |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=1 March 2021}}</ref> In 1977 Weller told the ''[[NME]]'' that the Jam would vote Conservative at the next election,<ref>{{Cite book |first=Paolo |last=Hewitt |title=A Beat Concerto: Revised Edition |year=1996 |page=40 |publisher=Boxtree |isbn=0-7522-0269-3}}</ref> but they later visibly changed their attitude.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/04/british-musicians-really-hated-margaret-thatcher.html | title=Margaret Thatcher vs. Pop Culture | magazine=Slate | date=8 April 2013 | last1=Weigel | first1=David }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://revsoc21.uk/2017/03/05/its-up-to-us-to-change-this-town-called-malice-the-politics-of-paul-weller-the-jam-and-the-style-council/ | title=It's up to us to change this Town called Malice: The politics of Paul Weller, the Jam and the Style Council | date=5 March 2017 }}</ref>

After the non-LP single "[[All Around the World (The Jam song)|All Around the World]]" nearly reached the UK Top 10, the Jam, having achieved a notable and loyal following in such a short time,<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in The Jam,'' p. 70.</ref> were pressed to produce more material quickly. Their second album, ''[[This Is the Modern World]]'', was released later in 1977. Bruce Foxton, generally considered a lesser songwriter than Weller, contributed two songs to the LP ("Don't Tell Them You're Sane" and "London Traffic"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/this-is-the-modern-world-mw0000312237 |title=The Jam: This is the Modern World |publisher=allmusic.com |date=24 May 2010 |access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref> both of which attracted criticism. His composing output gradually decreased, leaving Weller firmly established as the band's chief songwriter.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in The Jam,'' {{ISBN|978-1-783-05794-8}}, pp. 94–95.</ref>

===''All Mod Cons'' (1978)===
In March 1978, the Jam released "[[News of the World (song)|News of the World]]", a non-album single that was written and sung by Foxton. It charted at No.&nbsp;27 in the UK, and was the band's second biggest hit to date.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Jam |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14105/the-jam/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614075156/https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14105/the-jam/ |archive-date=14 June 2017 |access-date=2 March 2024 |website=Official Charts}}</ref> This was the only Foxton solo composition to be released as a Jam A-side. When the band went back into the studio to record a third album of primarily Foxton contributions, their songs were dismissed by producers as poor, and they held off recording an album in hopes that Weller would once again find inspiration.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |last=Reed |first=John |title=Paul Weller: My Ever Changing Moods |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=2005 |isbn=1844494918 |edition=4th |pages=78}}</ref> "News of the World" was used in the opening theme of the BBC television show ''[[Mock the Week]]'' during its extended run.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b085z8kv|title=Mock the Week: Christmas Special |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=14 December 2016 |access-date=7 January 2017}}</ref>

The Jam released their next single, the double A-side "[[David Watts (Ray Davies song)|David Watts]]"/"'A' Bomb in Wardour Street". "David Watts" was a cover of a [[The Kinks|Kinks]] song, throughout which Weller and Foxton traded lead vocals. "'A' Bomb in Wardour Street" was a Weller original.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |last=Alexander |first=Phil |date=12 August 2013 |title=The Jam: All Mod Cons Revisited |url=https://www.mojo4music.com/5135/the-jam-all-mod-cons-revisited/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122113827/https://www.mojo4music.com/5135/the-jam-all-mod-cons-revisited/ |archive-date=22 January 2014 |access-date=2 March 2024 |website=Mojo}}</ref> It became their most successful 7" since "[[All Around the World (The Jam song)|All Around the World]]".<ref name=":2" />

It was not until their next single, "[[Down in the Tube Station at Midnight]]", that the Jam really regained their former critical acclaim.<ref name=":4" /> Around this time, the Jam slimmed their team of two producers to one, [[Vic Coppersmith-Heaven]], who helped develop the group's sound.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sweeting |first=Adam |date=2002-04-26 |title=That was the modern world |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/apr/26/shopping.artsfeatures |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613121732/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/apr/26/shopping.artsfeatures |archive-date=13 June 2014 |access-date=2 March 2024 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> In November, the Jam released their third LP, ''[[All Mod Cons]]''. The twelve tracks included three of the tracks previously released as singles ("David Watts", "'A' Bomb In Wardour Street", and "Down in the Tube Station at Midnight") and two songs previously rejected for single release, the manic "Billy Hunt" and the acoustic ballad "English Rose".<ref name=":5" />

===''Setting Sons'' and ''Sound Affects'' (1979–1981)===
Following two successful and critically acclaimed non-LP singles, "[[Strange Town]]" and "[[When You're Young (The Jam song)|When You're Young]]",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/paul-weller/news/paul-weller-three-best-songs-the-jam-changingman/ |title=Paul Weller: I've Written Three Perfect Songs In My Life |publisher=radiox.co.uk |date=10 June 2015 |access-date=14 January 2017 |archive-date=7 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230907154304/https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/paul-weller/news/paul-weller-three-best-songs-the-jam-changingman/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> the band released "[[The Eton Rifles]]" in advance of their new album, ''[[Setting Sons]]'', released in November 1979.<ref name=":2" /> The LP also saw their first chart entry in the US, albeit at 137 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name=":3" /> The album began life as a [[concept album]]<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 131</ref> about three childhood friends, though in the end many of the songs did not relate to this theme.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Armstrong |first=Sam |date=2023-11-16 |title='Setting Sons': Ushering In A New Dawn For The Jam |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/setting-sons-ushers-in-a-new-dawn-for-the-jam/ |access-date=2024-03-02 |website=uDiscover Music}}</ref>

The band's first single of 1980 was intended to be "[[Dreams of Children]]". Due to a labelling error, however, the A- and B-sides of the single were reversed, resulting in the more conventional "[[Going Underground]]", the single's planned flipside, getting much more airplay and attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/dreams-of-children-mt0052556220 |title=The Jam: Dreams of Children |publisher=allmusic.com |date=12 June 2013|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref> The single was eventually officially recognised (and listed) as a double A-side by the time the release reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK.<ref name=":2" />

''[[Sound Affects]],'' released in November 1980, was a No.&nbsp;2 hit in the UK<ref name=":2" /> and peaked at No.&nbsp;72 on the US Billboard charts, the band's most successful album in the US.<ref>{{cite web |date=9 November 2014 |title=Billboard 200 |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/6911760/the-jam/chart |access-date=14 January 2017 |publisher=billboard.com}}</ref> Weller said that he was influenced by [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson album)|Off the Wall]].''<ref>{{Cite book|title = Paul Weller – The Changing Man|last = Hewitt|first = Paolo|publisher = corgi books|year = 2008|isbn = 9780552156097|pages = 132}}</ref> It included the acoustic "[[That's Entertainment (The Jam song)|That's Entertainment]]".

"[[Start!]]", released before the album, became another No.&nbsp;1 single.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 148</ref> Commenting on its similar bassline to The Beatles' ''Revolver'' cut "[[Taxman]]", Foxton said "Basslines like "Start!" just come to you. It’s not an intentional thing...it’s not quite like "Taxman", note-wise – you couldn’t sue me for it."<ref name=":6" />

On 30 October 1982, after a world tour, Weller announced his intention to disband the Jam.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Sexton |first=Paul |date=30 October 2023 |title=The Bitterest Pill: The Breakup Announcement The Jam Fans Dreaded |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/the-jam-announce-split/ |access-date=29 February 2024 |website=uDiscover Music}}</ref> They also made their final appearances on ''Top of the Pops''<ref name=":0" /> and ''[[The Tube (1982 TV series)|The Tube]]'' to promote "Beat Surrender".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Whatley |first=Jack |date=5 November 2021 |title=The best performances from Channel 4's 'The Tube' |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/tube-best-performances-iggy-smiths-jam-fall-r-e-m/ |access-date=29 February 2024 |website=Far Out magazine}}</ref> The tour included five consecutive nights at the [[Wembley Arena]].<ref name=":1" /> The last date on the original itinerary had been scheduled for 9 December 1982 at [[Guildford Civic Hall]], close to the band's hometown of Woking. Due to ticket demand, an additional date was added at the [[Brighton Conference Centre]] on 11 December 1982 for their last performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wells|first1=Simon|title=The Jam: December&nbsp;11th 1982 by Simon Wells|url=http://www.modculture.co.uk/the-jam-december-11th-1982-by-simon-wells/|website=Modculture|access-date=20 December 2016|date=6 September 2011}}</ref>

The decision to split was solely Weller's. Explaining at the time that he disliked the idea of continuing for as long as possible simply because they were successful, he later told ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' in advance of a 2015 Sky documentary on the band, "I wanted to end it to see what else I was capable of, and I'm still sure we stopped at the right time. I'm proud of what we did but I didn't want to dilute it, or for us to get embarrassing by trying to go on forever. We finished at our peak. I think we had achieved all we wanted or needed to, both commercially and artistically."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Halina|title=Paul Weller insists The Jam will never reunite as it's 'against everything we stood for'|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/paul-weller-insists-jam-never-6319736|website=Mirror|access-date=20 December 2016|date=25 August 2015}}</ref>

Weller's decision to move on, announced by his father, the band's manager, at an extraordinary band meeting in the summer of 1982, "came as a shock" to Buckler and Foxton, who wanted to keep the band together. Buckler told the ''Woking News and Mail'' in 2012: "It was like we were going to be driving over a cliff at the end of the year, and you keep thinking 'Well, maybe he'll change his mind'."<ref name=Woking>{{cite web|last1=Rutter|first1=Barry|title=Break-up of The Jam was bitterest pill for Rick Buckler|url=http://www.wokingnewsandmail.co.uk/?p=365|access-date=20 December 2016|date=7 March 2012}}</ref> Both Buckler and Foxton described the experience as bitter, but in later years both expressed understanding, if not complete acceptance.<ref name=Woking /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Foxton|first1=Bruce|title=Bruce Foxton: 'There's no need for the Jam to get back together'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/11736628/Bruce-Foxton-Theres-no-need-for-the-Jam-to-get-back-together.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/11736628/Bruce-Foxton-Theres-no-need-for-the-Jam-to-get-back-together.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=20 December 2016|date=17 July 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Following the split, Foxton did not speak to Weller for over 20&nbsp;years, and Buckler said in 2015 that he still had not spoken to Weller since, despite repeated attempts by Buckler and Foxton in 1983 and 1984 to meet up with and talk to Weller.<ref name=Woking /> As the farewell tour neared its end, [[Polydor]] released a live album titled ''[[Dig the New Breed]]'', a collection of songs from various concert performances over the band's five-year career which, while commercially successful, met with mixed reviews. The month after the final concert in Brighton, Polydor re-released all sixteen of the band's singles, nine of which re-entered the UK charts on 22&nbsp;January 1983.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Jam's Swift Chart Comeback|url=http://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/jams-swift-chart-comeback|website=Udiscovermusic|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref>

==Post-split releases==
''[[Snap!

A five-CD box set ''[[Direction Reaction Creation]]'', featuring all of the Jam's studio material (plus a disc of rarities) peaked at No.&nbsp;8 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] upon its release in 1997;<ref name=":2" /> an unprecedented achievement for a box set. In 2002, [[Virgin Radio]] counted down the top 100 British music artists of all-time as polled by listeners and the Jam were No.&nbsp;5 on the list.

==Post-split careers==
[[File:Paulweller1.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Paul Weller]] performing in the 2000s]]
In early 1983, Weller announced the formation of a new band, [[the Style Council]], a duo with keyboard player [[Mick Talbot]], formerly of the minor [[mod revival]] band [[the Merton Parkas]]. They would eventually split in 1989.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/16/paul-weller-style-council-more-modern-classics-rocks-backpages|title=Paul Weller: 'Most people dislike me anyway … it can only get better'|last=Snow|first=Mat|date=16 April 2014|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref> He subsequently embarked on a successful career as a [[Paul Weller|solo artist]].

Following a short stint recording demos with [[Jake Burns]] and [[Dolphin Taylor]], previously of Irish punk outfit [[Stiff Little Fingers]], Foxton released his debut single "[[Freak (Bruce Foxton song)|Freak]]" on [[Arista Records]]. Entering the [[UK Singles Chart]] at No. 34 on 30 July 1983, it eventually peaked at No. 23<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Freak |title=Freak |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=27 January 2014}}</ref> and secured an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Foxton's solo album ''[[Touch Sensitive (album)|Touch Sensitive]]'' followed in 1984, but subsequent singles "This Is the Way", "It Makes Me Wonder" and "My Imagination (S.O.S.)" failed to enter the Top 40. A final single "Play This Game to Win" was released on [[Harvest Records]] in November 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/har5239 |title=Bruce Foxton – Play This Game To Win / Welcome to the Hero – Harvest – UK – HAR 5239 |publisher=45cat |access-date=27 January 2014}}</ref>

Foxton went on to replace [[Ali McMordie]] in a reformed Stiff Little Fingers in 1990, remaining with the band until January 2006, when he quit to pursue other projects. Later that year he joined [[Simon Townshend]] (Pete Townshend's brother), and [[Mark Brzezicki]] and [[Bruce Watson (Scottish guitarist)|Bruce Watson]] (both of [[Big Country]]) in the band [[Casbah Club]], which released an album called ''[[Venustraphobia]]''.

After the Jam split, Buckler formed [[Time UK (band)|Time UK]] with [[Jimmy Edwards (musician)|Jimmy Edwards]] and Ray Simone,<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in the Jam'' p. 158</ref> formerly of [[Masterswitch]], ex-[[Tom Robinson Band]] guitarist Danny Kustow and (briefly) former [[Radio Stars]]/[[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] bassist [[Martin Gordon]]. The band released three singles "The Cabaret", "Playground of Privilege" and "You Won't Stop" before folding. In 1986, Buckler and Foxton released the single "Entertain Me" under the name [[Sharp (English band)|Sharp]].

In 2006, Buckler, who had not been playing for several years after Sharp quit, formed a band named [[From the Jam|the Gift]], playing material from ''The Jam'' with musicians Russell Hastings and David Moore.<ref>''That's Entertainment: My Life in The Jam'' pp. 189–190</ref> Hastings, who spent many years as a local musician including a couple of years in a Jam tribute band, took on guitar and lead vocal duties.
