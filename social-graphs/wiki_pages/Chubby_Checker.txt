'''Ernest Evans''' (born October 3, 1941), known professionally as '''Chubby Checker''', is an American [[rock 'n' roll]] singer and dancer. He is known for popularizing many dance styles, including [[Twist (dance)|the Twist]], with his 1960 hit cover of [[Hank Ballard]] & [[The Midnighters]]' R&B song "[[The Twist (song)|The Twist]]", and the [[pony (dance)|Pony]], with his 1961 cover of the song "[[Pony Time]]". His biggest UK hit, "[[Let's Twist Again]]", was released one year later (in 1962). That year, he also popularized the song "[[Limbo Rock]]", a previous-year instrumental hit by [[the Champs]] to which he added lyrics and its trademark [[Limbo (dance)|Limbo dance]]. He also introduced other dance styles, such as [[The Fly (Chubby Checker song)|the Fly]]. In September 2008, "The Twist" topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s list of the most popular [[single (music)|singles]] to have appeared in the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] since its debut in 1960, an honor it maintained in an August 2013 update of the list.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs|title=Hot 100 55th Anniversary: The All-Time Top 100 Songs|magazine=Billboard|access-date=26 October 2017|archive-date=July 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726075338/http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/2155531/the-hot-100-all-time-top-songs|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2014, Checker was inducted into the [[National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame]], and he was selected for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2025.<ref name="rr25">{{cite web |title=The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation unveils electrifying class of 2025 inductees |url=https://rockhall.com/press-release/the-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-foundation-unveils-electrifying-class-of-2025-inductees/ |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame |access-date=28 April 2025}}</ref>

==Early life==
Checker was born Ernest Evans in [[Spring Gully, South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Benjamin V|last=Franklin|title=An Encyclopedia of South Carolina Jazz and Blues Musicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsnYCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT147|date=30 May 2016|publisher=[[University of South Carolina Press]]|location=Columbia, South Carolina|isbn=978-1-61117-622-3|page=147}}</ref> He was raised in [[the projects]] of [[South Philadelphia]], where he lived with his parents, Raymond and Eartle Evans,<ref>UPI Telephoto (NAP 122601), December 1963.</ref> and two brothers.<ref name= Chubby>{{cite web|url=http://www.chubbychecker.com/bio.asp|title=The Official Site|website=ChubbyChecker.com|access-date=2015-08-18|archive-date=May 30, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230530044750/https://www.chubbychecker.com/bio.asp|url-status=dead}}</ref> By age eleven, Evans formed a street-corner harmony group. By the time he entered high school, Ernest had learned to play the piano a little at [[Settlement Music School]]. He entertained his classmates by performing vocal impressions of popular entertainers of the day, such as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Fats Domino]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chubby Checker |url=https://www.biography.com/musician/chubby-checker|website=biography.com|access-date=17 June 2019}}</ref> One of his classmates and friends at [[South Philadelphia High School]] was Fabian Forte, who would become a popular performer of the late 1950s and early 1960s as [[Fabian Forte|Fabian]].<ref name= Chubby />

After school Evans would entertain customers at his various jobs, including Fresh Farm Poultry in the [[Italian Market, Philadelphia|Italian Market]] on Ninth Street and at the Produce Market, with songs and jokes. It was his boss at the Produce Market, Anthony Tambone, who gave Evans the nickname "Chubby". The owner of Fresh Farm Poultry, Henry Colt, was so impressed by the boy's performances for the customers that he, along with his colleague and friend Kal Mann, who worked as a songwriter for [[Cameo-Parkway Records]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/ChubbyCheckerInterview.html |title=Interview With Chubby Checker|website= Classicbands.com|date=1961-02-01|access-date=2015-08-18}}</ref> arranged for young Chubby to do a private recording for ''[[American Bandstand]]'' host [[Dick Clark]]. After hearing Chubby's Fats Domino impression, Clark's wife Barbara suggested that Chubby be called "Chubby [[Checkers|Checker]]" in homage to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/checker.html|title=Chubby Checker|website=Classicbands.com|date=1958-11-11|access-date=2015-08-18|archive-date=May 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511001542/http://www.classicbands.com/checker.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/the-story-behind-how-the-twist-creator-chubby-checker-got-his-name/|title=The Story Behind How "The Twist" Creator Chubby Checker Got His Name|first=Tina|last=Benitez-Eves|date=February 2, 2023|website=American Songwriter}}</ref>

==Career==
===1950s–1960s===
[[File:Chubby Checker 1964.jpg|thumb|Chubby Checker performing in 1964]]
In December 1958, Checker privately recorded a novelty single for Clark in which the singer portrayed a school teacher with an unruly classroom of musical performers. The premise allowed Checker to imitate such acts as [[Fats Domino]], [[The Coasters]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Cozy Cole]], and [[The Chipmunks]], each singing "[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]". Clark sent the song out as his Christmas greeting, and it received such good response that Cameo-Parkway signed Checker to a recording contract.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Jim|url=http://archive.org/details/twiststoryofsong0000daws|title=The twist : the story of the song that changed the world|date=1995|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|others=Internet Archive|isbn=978-0-571-19852-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/twiststoryofsong0000daws/page/30/mode/2up 30-31]}}</ref> Titled "[[The Class (song)|The Class]]", the single became Checker's first release, charting at No. 38 in the spring of 1959.<ref name=":0">{{cite magazine|title=Chubby Checker|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/chubby-checker/|access-date=January 16, 2022|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

Checker introduced his version of "The Twist" at the age of 18 in July 1960 in [[Wildwood, New Jersey]] at the Rainbow Club. "The Twist" went on to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] not just once in 1960, but yet again in a separate chart run in late 1961. The first success was attributed to teens, and the unprecedented second number-one Billboard ranking was driven by older audiences following a spirited live performance<ref>{{cite AV media|date=October 22, 1961|title=Chubby Checker "The Twist & Let's Twist Again" on The Ed Sullivan Show|language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDGprGUreOc|publisher=The Ed Sullivan Show via YouTube|access-date=March 13, 2022}}</ref> of the song by Checker on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]], seen by over 10 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Jim|date=2012|title="The Twist"—Chubby Checker (1960)|url=https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/TheTwist.pdf|url-status=live|website=[[Library of Congress]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017102507/https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/TheTwist.pdf|archive-date=October 17, 2020 }}</ref> ([[Bing Crosby]]'s "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" had also achieved number one twice on ''Billboard''{{'}}s earlier chart.)

"[[The Twist (song)|The Twist]]" had previously peaked at No. 16 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' rhythm and blues chart, in the 1959 version recorded by its author, [[Hank Ballard]], whose band The Midnighters first performed the dance on stage. Checker's "Twist", however, was a nationwide smash, aided by his many appearances on Dick Clark's ''[[American Bandstand]]'', the top 10 ''American Bandstand'' ranking of the song, and the teenagers on the show who enjoyed dancing the Twist. The song was so ubiquitous that Checker felt that his critics thought he could only succeed as a dance demonstrator. Checker later lamented: ""The Twist" really ruined my life. I was on my way to becoming a big nightclub performer, and "The Twist" just wiped it out&nbsp;... It got so out of proportion. No one ever believes I have talent."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Twist: The Story of the Song and Dance That Changed the World|last=Dawson|first=Jim|publisher=[[Faber & Faber]]|year=1995|isbn=9780571198528|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=[https://archive.org/details/twiststoryofsong0000daws/page/26 26]|url=https://archive.org/details/twiststoryofsong0000daws/page/26}}</ref> By 1965 alone, "The Twist" had sold over 15 million copies, and was awarded multiple [[music recording sales certification|gold discs]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London, England|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/122 122–3]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/122}}</ref>

Despite Checker's initial disapproval, he found follow-up success with a succession of up-tempo dance tracks, including "The Hucklebuck" (No. 14), "[[The Fly (Chubby Checker song)|The Fly]]" (No. 7), "Dance the Mess Around" (No. 24), and "[[Pony Time]]", which became his second No. 1 single.<ref name=":0" /> Checker's follow-up "twist" single, "[[Let's Twist Again]]", won the 1962 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock and Roll Recording]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Unterberger|first=Andrew|date=January 26, 2018|title=60 Grammys, 60 Moments: The Greatest Moment From Every Grammys Ceremony So Far|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/greatest-grammy-moments-60-years-8095834/|url-status=live|access-date=January 16, 2022|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220116055342/https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/greatest-grammy-moments-60-years-8095834/|archive-date=January 16, 2022}}</ref> A 1962 duet with [[Dee Dee Sharp]], "Slow Twistin'", reached No. 3 on the national charts. Other substantial hits included "[[Dancin' Party]]", "[[Popeye the Hitchhiker]]", "[[Twenty Miles]]", "[[Birdland (Chubby Checker song)|Birdland]]", "[[Loddy Lo]]", and a Christmas duet with [[Bobby Rydell]], "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]". "[[Limbo Rock]]" reached No. 2 on 22–29 December 1962, becoming Checker's last top ten hit. Checker continued to have top 40 singles until 1965, his last being "[[Let's Do the Freddie]]" (No. 40), a variation on [[Freddie and the Dreamers]]' dance tune "Do the Freddie", with new melody and lyrics. Changes in public tastes, owing mostly to the [[British Invasion]] and [[Music history of the United States in the 1960s#Rock|counterculture era]], ended his hit-making career. He spent much of the rest of the 1960s touring and recording in Europe.

===1970s–1990s===
"The Twist" was recorded for [[Cameo-Parkway Records]] and along with the label's other material, became unavailable after the early 1970s because of the company's internal legal disputes. For decades, almost all compilations of Checker's hits consisted of re-recordings. The 1970s saw a shift and resurgence for his career, including a temporary stint as a [[disco]] artist. Checker continued to be a superstar in Europe with television and records.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} A dance-floor cover version of [[the Beatles]]' "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]" released in 1969 on [[Buddah Records]], his first chart entry in three years, reached No. 82.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Billboard Hot 100, May 3, 1969|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1969-05-03|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=July 8, 2017|archive-date=August 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826092100/http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1969-05-03|url-status=live}}</ref> It was Checker's last chart appearance until 1982 when he hit No. 91 with "Running".<ref name=":0" />

In 1971, Checker at his own insistence recorded a [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] album filled with music he felt was "current" that was initially only released in Europe. Originally named ''[[Chequered!]]'', it was renamed over the years in subsequent re-releases as ''New Revelation'', ''The Other Side Of Chubby Checker'', and sometimes as ''Chubby Checker''. The songs were all written by Checker and produced by former [[Jimi Hendrix]] producer [[Ed Chalpin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/ed-chalpin-mn0001538682|title=AllMusic – Ed Chalpin Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref> but the studio musicians' names are unknown.

Later in the decade, he recorded an album of "audiophile re-creations" of his greatest hits, for producer Stan Shulman.

In 1988, Chubby teamed up with hip-hop trio [[The Fat Boys]] with their version of ''The Twist (Yo, Twist)'': this reached No 2 in the UK.

===2000s and beyond===
Checker had a single at No. 1 on ''Billboard's'' dance [[record chart|chart]] in July 2008 with "Knock Down the Walls". The single also made the top 30 on the Adult Contemporary chart.<ref name=":0" /> [[Roger Filgate]] of [[Wishbone Ash]] is featured on lead guitar.<ref>{{cite web|date=2009-09-17|title=Guitarist Filgate performs with Chubby Checker in Danbury|url=https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Guitarist-Filgate-performs-with-Chubby-Checker-in-132067.php|access-date=2022-01-16|website=NewsTimes|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2002, Checker protested outside of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony, over the lack of radio airplay of his hit "[[The Twist (song)|The Twist]]" and his perception that the Hall of Fame had snubbed him.
