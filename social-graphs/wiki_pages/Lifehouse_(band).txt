==History==
===1996–1999: Blyss and formation===
[[Jason Wade]] had been writing songs as a coping mechanism since his parents' divorce. After moving to Los Angeles in 1995, he met bassist Sergio Andrade, his next-door neighbor.<ref name="Wolfe">{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/l/p/Lifehouse.htm|title=Lifehouse|last=Wolfe|first=Daniel|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=August 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825201301/http://top40.about.com/od/l/p/Lifehouse.htm|archive-date=August 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The following year, Wade, Andrade, and Jon "Diff" Palmer formed Blyss, the forerunner of Lifehouse, and began to play live shows at high schools and colleges.<ref name="Wolfe"/><ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1654377/bio|title=Jason Wade (II) – Biography|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=August 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name="JesusFreakHideout">{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/Lifehouse2006.asp|title=Lifehouse Interview 2006|website=Jesusfreakhideout.com|access-date=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Later, Collin Hayden and Aaron Lord were added to the band.<ref name="IdolMe">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolme.com/artist/lifehouse.html|title=Lifehouse Biography|publisher=IdolMe.com|access-date=August 5, 2012}}</ref>

Soon thereafter, word-of-mouth reached producer [[Ron Aniello]], who introduced Jason to [[Jude Cole]], who in turn introduced him to [[DreamWorks Records]] principal Michael Ostin.<ref name="IMDB"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nctimes.com/entertainment/music/article_4670fce4-d32a-5f12-9f7a-82ac75b12538.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130208133725/http://www.nctimes.com/entertainment/music/article_4670fce4-d32a-5f12-9f7a-82ac75b12538.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 8, 2013|title=Lifehouse responds to low point with vigor|last=Moeller|first=Sean|publisher=[[North County Times]]|access-date=August 5, 2012}}</ref> In 1998, Aniello produced Blyss's first demos, with the financial backing of DreamWorks Records. Some of these recordings would form the 1999 EP ''[[Diff's Lucky Day]]'', which would be sold at live concerts or distributed among friends and music industry contacts.<ref name="IdolMe"/>

===2000–2001: ''No Name Face''===
{{Main|No Name Face}}
In 2000, Blyss re-recorded, remixed, and released 12 of the 15 ''Diff's Lucky Day'' session demos as ''[[No Name Face]]'', their debut major label release under the name of Lifehouse.<ref name="JesusFreakHideout"/><ref name="IdolMe"/> On their choosing the band name, frontman Jason Wade said, "It's about what we do as a band and for me personally. Most of this record is about my life and about life's circumstances. Not only my life, but other people's lives. We thought Lifehouse was a good name for it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertlivewire.com/interviews/lifehouse.htm|title=Lifehouse Sees the Summit: Livewire's Exclusive Interview with Jason Wade of Lifehouse|publisher=Concert Livewire|access-date=August 5, 2012}}</ref> 

''No Name Face'' met significant commercial success and established the band, and eventually would sell in excess of four million copies worldwide.<ref name="IMDB"/> This was in part due to the success of "[[Hanging by a Moment]]", Lifehouse's first commercial single. Due to the charisma and talent of frontman Wade, DreamWorks Records' focus was primarily on him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Lifehouse/e/B000AR7ZRO/ref=ac_dpt_sa_link|title=Amazon.com: Lifehouse: Bio|publisher=Amazon.com|access-date=August 5, 2012}}</ref> "Hanging by a Moment" was the third song in chart history to be named the "No. 1 Song of the Year" on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] despite not having reached No. 1 on any weekly ''Billboard'' Hot 100 survey (after [[Sam the Sham|Sam the Sham & The Pharaohs]]' "[[Wooly Bully]]" in 1965 and [[Faith Hill]]'s "[[Breathe (Faith Hill song)|Breathe]]" in 2000).{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The second single from the album, "[[Sick Cycle Carousel]]", was not as commercially successful as "Hanging by a Moment", peaking at No. 21 on the ''Billboard'' Modern Rock chart; the third and final single was "[[Breathing (Lifehouse song)|Breathing]]", a reworking of a song featured on ''Diff's Lucky Day''.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The song "Everything" was the first of many Lifehouse songs to be featured in [[The WB]]'s future hit series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.<ref name="IdolMe"/> It was used in the [[Pilot (Smallville)|series pilot]] and [[Tempest (Smallville)|season 1 finale]], and again in the series' 200th episode "Homecoming" in the show's [[Smallville (season 10)|10th and final season]], as an homage to its [[Smallville (season 1)|season 1]] episodes nine years prior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kryptonsite.com/smallvillemusicseason1.htm|title=KryptonSite's Smallville Music Guide: Season 1|publisher=KryptonSite.com|access-date=August 5, 2012}}</ref> The song "[[You and Me (Lifehouse song)|You and Me]]" from the band's [[Lifehouse (album)|eponymous third album]] would be released on Smallville's second [[soundtrack]], ''[[Smallville: The Metropolis Mix]]'', in an extended form subtitled "You and Me (Wedding Version)", and the band itself would perform the song live as a [[guest appearance|special guest appearance]] in the [[school prom]] scene at the end of the [[Smallville (season 4)|season 4]] episode "Spirit". Seven of the band's songs would be featured in episodes of the series' first four seasons.

The song "Somewhere in Between", also from ''No Name Face,'' was featured in the first-season episode of ''[[Falcon Beach]]'', "The Blame Game".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.falconbeach.ca/index.aspx?go=/episode_108.aspx |title=The official Falcon Beach website |publisher=Falconbeach.ca |date=December 4, 1999 |access-date=August 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728004537/http://www.falconbeach.ca/index.aspx?go=%2Fepisode_108.aspx |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

By the time Lifehouse's first album was released, Palmer had left the band, and Wade and Andrade were the only remaining founding members.<ref name="IMDB"/> Soon after recording ''No Name Face'', Wade and Andrade met [[Rick Woolstenhulme]], who auditioned for the needed drummer part and joined the band as full-time drummer.<ref name="IMDB"/> Before the audition, Woolstenhulme had been rehearsing in an adjacent room to Lifehouse and frequently he and Wade would pass each other without meeting the other.<ref name="JesusFreakHideout"/>

=== 2002–2004: ''Stanley Climbfall'' ===
{{Main|Stanley Climbfall}}
Shortly after a long tour for ''No Name Face'', Lifehouse reentered the studio to cut their second album, ''Stanley Climbfall''. The album's initial success was short-lived and its singles, 2002's "[[Spin (song)|Spin]]" and 2003's "[[Take Me Away (Lifehouse song)|Take Me Away]]", were vastly overshadowed by the success of the first album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/l/p/Lifehouse.htm|title=Top 40 About: Lifehouse|access-date=January 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825201301/http://top40.about.com/od/l/p/Lifehouse.htm|archive-date=August 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Shortly after the album debuted, Rick's brother Sean Woolstenhulme (of [[The Calling (band)|The Calling]]) officially became the fourth member of the band in June 2002. He had previously toured with Lifehouse.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In April 2004, Sergio Andrade confirmed that he had decided to leave the band to pursue individual projects. Shortly after his departure, Sean also left the band to pursue other musical projects such as [[Abandoned Pools]] and [[The Jimmy Chamberlin Complex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcall.com/2005/05/27/new-moments-on-the-way-for-retooled-lifehouse/|title=New Moments on the Way for Retooled Lifehouse|website=Articles.mcall.com|date=May 27, 2005 |access-date=January 16, 2015}}</ref>

{{Main|Lifehouse (album)}}
Jason Wade and Rick Woolstenhulme remained the active members of Lifehouse. In September 2004, [[Bryce Soderberg]] (previously of AM Radio) signed on as Lifehouse's new bassist. On July 6, 2004, they went to [[Maryland]] to begin work on their eponymous third album, spending less than two months in the studio to record thirteen songs produced by [[John Alagia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popentertainment.com/lifehouse.htm|title=Lifehouse hanging on the charts|website=Popentertainment.com |date=May 28, 2005 |access-date=January 16, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Lifehouse (album)|Lifehouse]]'' was released on March 22, 2005.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

It was written several years prior and was originally performed by Jason Wade for the 2000 independent film ''All Over Again''.
