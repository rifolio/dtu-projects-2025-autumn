'''Crosby, Stills & Nash''' ('''CSN''') was a [[folk rock]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] composed of the American singer-songwriters [[David Crosby]] and [[Stephen Stills]] and the English-American singer-songwriter [[Graham Nash]]. When joined by the Canadian singer-songwriter [[Neil Young]], they were known as '''Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young''' ('''CSNY'''). They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies and lasting influence on [[Music of the United States|American music]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|culture]], their political activism and their tumultuous relationships.

CSN formed in 1968 shortly after Crosby, Stills and Nash performed together informally, discovering they harmonized well. Crosby had been asked to leave [[the Byrds]] in late 1967, Stills's band [[Buffalo Springfield]] had broken up in early 1968, and Nash left his band [[the Hollies]] in December. They signed a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]] in early 1969. Their first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'' (1969) produced the [[Top 40]] hits "[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]" and "[[Marrakesh Express]]". In preparation for touring, the trio added Young, Stills's former Buffalo Springfield bandmate, as a full member, along with the touring members [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] (drums) and [[Greg Reeves]] (bass). As Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, they performed at the [[Woodstock]] festival that August.

The band's first album with Young, ''[[Déjà Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|Déjà Vu]]'', reached number one on several international charts in 1970. It remains their best-selling album, selling more than eight million copies and producing the hit singles "[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]", "[[Teach Your Children]]", and "[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]". The group's second tour, which produced the live double album ''[[4 Way Street]]'' (1971), was fraught with arguments between Young and Taylor, which resulted in Taylor being replaced by [[John Barbata]], and tensions with Stills. At the end of the tour they disbanded. The group reunited several times, sometimes with Young, and released eight studio and four live albums. CSN's final studio album was 1999's ''[[Looking Forward]]'', and they remained a performing act until 2015. Crosby died in 2023.

Crosby, Stills & Nash were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997 and all three members were also inducted for their work in other groups: Crosby for [[the Byrds]], Stills for [[Buffalo Springfield]] and Nash for [[the Hollies]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/alphabetical/ |title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=April 15, 2013 |access-date=August 24, 2015 |archive-date=November 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115021528/https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/alphabetical |url-status=live }}</ref> Young was also inducted as a solo artist and as a member of Buffalo Springfield.

==History==
===CSN formation and debut album: July 1968 – May 1969===
CSN was born with members from two prominent bands and the split of a third. David Crosby played guitar, sang, and wrote songs with [[the Byrds]]; Stephen Stills had been a guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist, and songwriter in the band [[Buffalo Springfield]] (which also featured Neil Young); and Graham Nash had been a guitarist, singer, and songwriter with [[the Hollies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/crosby-stills-nash-young-mn0000130036/biography|work=allmusic.com|author=William Ruhlmann|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young Biography by William Ruhlmann|access-date=February 2, 2020|archive-date=July 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729000243/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/crosby-stills-nash-young-mn0000130036/biography|url-status=live}}</ref>

Crosby had been sacked from the Byrds in October 1967 due to disagreements over his songwriting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZBKDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT93|page=93|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|publisher=Hachette UK|date=September 23, 2008 |isbn=9780786726110}}</ref> At the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], Crosby stood in for Neil Young (who quit the band before the gig) with Buffalo Springfield. By early 1968, Buffalo Springfield had disintegrated, and, after aiding in putting together the band's final album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'', Stills was unemployed. Following the Monterey gig, Stills and Crosby began meeting informally and jamming. The result of one encounter in Florida on Crosby's [[schooner]] was the song "[[Wooden Ships]]", composed in collaboration with another guest, [[Paul Kantner]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 65</ref>

Graham Nash had known Crosby since the Byrds' UK tour of 1966. Two years later, when the Hollies relocated to California in 1968, Nash resumed his acquaintance with him.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 103</ref> Nash met Stills at a party at [[Peter Tork]]'s house in Laurel Canyon. He was captivated by Stills "banging the shit out of" a piano in a "[[Music of Brazil|Brazilian]], and [[Latin music|Latin]], and [[Boogie-woogie|boogie woogie]], and rock and roll" style. In July 1968, over dinner at a party at another Laurel Canyon house (the home of either [[Joni Mitchell]] or [[Cass Elliot]]—accounts by the three members differ<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pp. 72–3</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|author=Lisa Robinson|title=An Oral History of Laurel Canyon, the Sixties and Seventies Music Mecca|language=en|magazine=Vanity Fair|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/02/laurel-canyon-music-scene|access-date=September 11, 2017|archive-date=September 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911234130/https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/02/laurel-canyon-music-scene|url-status=live}}</ref>), Nash invited Stills and Crosby to perform a Stills composition, "You Don't Have to Cry".  They did so twice, after which Nash had learned the lyrics and improvised a new harmony part on a third rendition. The vocals gelled, and the three realized that they had a very good vocal chemistry. While singing the third time, they broke out in laughter. The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, and the Hollies had all been successful harmony bands: as Nash said in a 2014 interview, "We knew what we were doing". He continued, "Whatever sound Crosby, Stills, and Nash has was born in 30 seconds. That's how long it took us to harmonize."

Creatively frustrated with the Hollies, Nash decided to quit the band in December 1968 and flew to Los Angeles two days later. The trio traveled to London in early 1969 to rehearse for what turned out to be an unsuccessful audition with [[the Beatles]]' [[Apple Records]]. However, back in California, [[Ahmet Ertegun]], who had been a fan of Buffalo Springfield and was disappointed by that band's demise, signed them to [[Atlantic Records]].<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 144.</ref> From the outset, given their previous experiences, the trio decided not to be locked into a group structure. They used their surnames as identification to ensure independence and a guarantee that the band could not continue without one of them, unlike both the Byrds and the Hollies. They picked up a management team in [[Elliot Roberts]] and [[David Geffen]], who got them signed to Atlantic and helped to gain clout for the group in the industry.<ref>McDonough, p. 252.</ref> Roberts kept the band focused and dealt with egos, while Geffen handled the business deals, since, in Crosby's words, they needed a "shark" and Geffen was it.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pg. 79</ref>

The band then ran into a problem. Stills was already signed to Atlantic Records through his Buffalo Springfield contract. Crosby had been released from his Byrds deal with Columbia, as he was considered to be unimportant and too difficult to work with. Nash, however, was still signed to [[Epic Records]] through the Hollies. Ertegun cut a deal with [[Clive Davis]] to essentially trade Nash to Atlantic in exchange for [[Richie Furay]] (who was also signed to Atlantic by virtue of his membership in Buffalo Springfield) and [[Poco (band)|Poco]], his new band.<ref>Robert Greenfield. ''The Last Sultan: The Life and Times of Ahmet Ertegun.'' Simon and Schuster. 2011. 202-3.</ref>

The trio's first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'', was released in May 1969. The eponymously titled album was a major hit in the United States, peaking at No. 6 on the ''Billboard'' album chart during a 107-week stay that spawned two [[Top 40]] hits ("[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]" [#21] and "[[Marrakesh Express]]" [#28]) and significant airplay on [[FM radio]]. The album ultimately earned a RIAA [[platinum album|triple platinum]] certification in 1999 and [[platinum album|quadruple platinum]] certification in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=379|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash – Chart history – Billboard|website=Billboard.com|access-date=February 20, 2017|archive-date=February 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221005737/http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=379|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=305|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash – Chart history – Billboard|website=Billboard.com|access-date=February 20, 2017|archive-date=February 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220172552/http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=305|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=crosby,%20stills&col=certification_date&ord=asc#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum – RIAA|website=Riaa.com|access-date=April 8, 2017|archive-date=December 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211226101147/https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=crosby,%20stills&col=certification_date&ord=asc#search_section|url-status=live}}</ref>

===CSNY: Déjà Vu to 4 Way Street, August 1969 – April 1971===
With the exception of drum parts (primarily performed by [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]]) and a handful of rhythm and acoustic guitar parts from Crosby and Nash, Stills (accorded the moniker "Captain Many Hands" by his bandmates) handled most of the instrumentation (including every lead guitar, bass and keyboard part) on the album, which left the band in need of additional personnel to be able to tour, a necessity given the debut album's commercial impact. Retaining Taylor, the band tried initially to hire a keyboard player. Stills initially approached virtuoso multi-instrumentalist [[Steve Winwood]], who was already occupied with the newly formed group [[Blind Faith]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 92</ref> Ertegun suggested former Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young, also managed by Elliot Roberts, as a fairly obvious choice; though principally a guitarist, Young was a proficient keyboardist and could alternate on the instrument with Stills and Nash in a live context.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 163–4</ref> Stills and Nash initially objected, Stills because of his history with Young in Buffalo Springfield and Nash because of his personal unfamiliarity with Young. Despite that, the trio expanded to a quartet with Young a full partner. The terms of the contract allowed Young full freedom to maintain a parallel career with his new band, [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]].

They initially completed the rhythm section with former Buffalo Springfield bassist [[Bruce Palmer]]. However, Palmer was let go due to his persistent personal problems following rehearsals at the [[Cafe au Go Go]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]]; according to Crosby, "Bruce Palmer was into [[drug injection|another instrument]] and his head was not where it should have been."<ref name="Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94">Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94</ref> Teenaged [[Motown]] session bassist [[Greg Reeves]] joined in Palmer's place at the recommendation of [[Rick James]], a friend and former bandmate of Neil Young.<ref name="Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94"/>

The now expanded group embarked on a four-leg, 39-date tour that ended with three European concerts in January 1970. Their first major public gig was on August 16, 1969, at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago, with [[Joni Mitchell]] as their opening act. They mentioned they were going to someplace called [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] the next day, but that they had no idea where it was. Their one-hour show at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning of August 18, 1969, was a [[baptism by fire]]. The crowd of industry friends looking on from offstage was intimidating and prompted Stills to say, "This is the second time we've ever played in front of people, man. We're scared shitless." Their appearance at the festival and in the subsequent movie ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'',<ref>Neil Young is notably absent from the documentary film. In an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeEWMnRcrTY interview in 2000 for VH1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116154159/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeEWMnRcrTY |date=November 16, 2019 }}, he revealed that he objected to being photographed at close quarters, so the cameras avoided him. In February 2019, [https://www.jambase.com/article/woodstock-documentary-bill-gerber-neil-young-janis-joplin it was reported] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829025223/https://www.jambase.com/article/woodstock-documentary-bill-gerber-neil-young-janis-joplin |date=August 29, 2019 }} that plans to release a restored version of the film would include footage of Young.</ref> along with recording the Joni Mitchell [[Woodstock (song)|song memorializing Woodstock]], boosted the visibility of the quartet. CSNY appeared at other prominent festivals that year. Footage from two performances from the [[Big Sur Folk Festival]] (held on the grounds of the [[Esalen Institute]] on September 13–14, 1969) appears in the movie ''[[Celebration at Big Sur]]''. They also appeared at the violence-plagued [[Altamont Free Concert]] on December 6, 1969, alongside [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], and the headlining [[Rolling Stones]]. During Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's set, Stills was reported to be repeatedly stabbed in the leg by a "stoned-out" Hells Angel, with a sharpened bicycle spoke.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/music/inside-altamont-new-book-looks-back-at-rocks-darkest-day-8690359|title=Inside Altamont: New Book Looks Back at Rock's "Darkest Day"|last=Ruggiero|first=Bob|date=2016-08-24|website=Houston Press|access-date=2019-09-20|archive-date=September 28, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928120454/https://www.houstonpress.com/music/inside-altamont-new-book-looks-back-at-rocks-darkest-day-8690359|url-status=live}}</ref> At the band's request, their performance was not included in the subsequent film ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' (1970).

Great anticipation had built for the expanded supergroup and their first album with Young, ''[[Déjà Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|Déjà Vu]]'', which arrived in stores in March 1970. It topped the charts during a 97-week stay in the United States and generated three hit singles, including the Stills-sung cover of Mitchell's "[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]" (#11) and both of Nash's contributions ("[[Teach Your Children]]" [#16] and "[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]" [#30]). Certified [[Multi-platinum|septuple platinum]] by [[RIAA]], the album's domestic sales currently sit at over 8 million copies; as of 2017, it remains the highest-selling album of each member's career.<ref name="greasylake.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.greasylake.org/the-circuit/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F106260-neil-young-bob-seger-and-crosby-stills-nash-youngusa-album-sales%2F|title=NEIL YOUNG, BOB SEGER and CROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG.....USA album sales|website=Greasy Lake Community|access-date=February 20, 2017|archive-date=March 1, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301045631/https://www.greasylake.org/the-circuit/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F106260-neil-young-bob-seger-and-crosby-stills-nash-youngusa-album-sales%2F|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Déjà Vu'' was also the first release on the Atlantic Records SD-7200 "superstar" line, created by the label for its highest-profile artists; subsequent solo albums by Crosby, Stills, and Nash were the next releases in this series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/atlantic7200.html |title=Atlantic Album Discography, Part 6 |publisher=Bsnpubs.com |date=October 6, 2005 |access-date=August 24, 2015 |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194912/http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/atlantic7200.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In consultation with other band members, Stills fired Reeves from the group shortly before the beginning of their second American tour in April 1970 "because [he] suddenly decided he was an [[Apache]] [[witch doctor]]."<ref name=csn124>''Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Authorized Biography''. Zimmer & Diltz, pp. 124.</ref> He further opined that "[Reeves] freaked too much on the bass and no one could keep up because [he] did not play one rhythm the same… he could play bass imaginatively, but he has to be predictable as well," while "Greg also wanted to sing some of his songs on the CSN&Y show, which I thought was ludicrous, only because the songs weren't great. We'll sing any song if it's great, but not just because it happens to be written by our bass player."<ref name=csn124 /> He was replaced by [[Calvin "Fuzzy" Samuels]], a homeless West Indian musician recently discovered by Stills at [[Island Records]]' London studios. Shortly thereafter, Taylor (who frequently clashed with Young over the band's tempos during the first tour and ''Déjà Vu'' sessions) was also dismissed when Young threatened to leave the group following the first performance of the tour at the [[Denver Coliseum]] on May 12, 1970. Notwithstanding these previous tensions, Taylor later asserted that his dismissal stemmed from a flirtation with Young's first wife (Topanga Canyon restaurateur Susan Acevedo) amid renewed conflict between Stills and Young in the aftermath of Reeves' firing. Shortly thereafter, drummer [[John Barbata]] (formerly of [[The Turtles]]) was hired for the remainder of the tour and associated recordings.

A week before the Denver performance, Young and Crosby were staying at a house near [[San Francisco]] when reports of the [[Kent State shootings]] arrived, inspiring Young to write the protest song "[[Ohio (1970 song)|Ohio]]". Recorded and rush-released weeks later with the new rhythm section, it peaked at No. 14 in August 1970, providing another American [[Top 20]] hit for the group.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 127</ref> Their previously recorded song "[[Teach Your Children]]" was still climbing the chart, yet the group insisted that it be rushed to release. Crosby later stated in an interview that his callbacks "how many more?" in the final stages of the song was ad-libbed, bringing out his pure frustration.

As the 23-show tour progressed, the tenuous nature of the partnership was strained by Stills's alcohol and cocaine abuse, culminating in an extended solo set not countenanced by the other band members at the [[Fillmore East]], when he was informed that [[Bob Dylan]] was in the audience. In this turbulent atmosphere, Crosby, Nash and Young decided to quit the tour during a two-night return engagement at Chicago's Auditorium Theatre in July 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-actual-honest-to-god-reunion-of-crosby-stills-and-nash-19770602|title=The Actual, Honest-to-God Reunion of Crosby, Stills and Nash|date=June 2, 1977|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=August 26, 2017|archive-date=June 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620051036/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-actual-honest-to-god-reunion-of-crosby-stills-and-nash-19770602|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/wild-tales-graham-nash-opens-sex-drugs-music-behind-crosby-stills-nash-young-article-1.1442620|title=In 'Wild Tales,' Graham Nash opens up about sex, drugs and music behind Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|website=Nydailynews.com|date=September 2013 |access-date=July 15, 2014|archive-date=December 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211226101201/https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/wild-tales-graham-nash-opens-sex-drugs-music-behind-crosby-stills-nash-young-article-1.1442620|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarmtn.org/year.php?year=1970|title=Sugar Mountain|website=Sugarmtn.org|access-date=February 20, 2017|archive-date=December 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223070108/http://sugarmtn.org/year.php?year=1970|url-status=live}}</ref> Singer [[Rita Coolidge]] had been romantically involved with Stills, and her leaving him for Nash has also been cited as a contributing factor behind the breakup of the band.<ref>Zimmer, Dave, and Diltz, Henry (1984).

Between September 1970 and May 1971, each of the quartet released high-profile solo albums: Young's ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' in September (which peaked at No. 8 and included his first Top 40 solo hit, "Only Love Can Break Your Heart" [#33]); Stills's [[Stephen Stills (album)|eponymous debut]] in November; Crosby's ''[[If I Could Only Remember My Name]]'' in February, and Nash's ''[[Songs for Beginners]]'' in May. Although all four solo LPs placed in the Top 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], Stills's entry (including two Top 40 hits, "Love the One You're With" [#14] and "Sit Yourself Down" [#37]) peaked the highest at No. 3. Stills was the first to release a second post-CSNY solo album, 1971's ''[[Stephen Stills 2]]'', which included two minor hits ("Change Partners" [#43]; "Marianne" [#42]) and peaked at No. 8. He supported this with a solo tour of major arenas (such as [[Madison Square Garden]] and the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|L.A. Forum]]) in the summer of 1971 with Dallas Taylor, Fuzzy Samuels, and [[the Memphis Horns]]. In the fall of 1971, Crosby and Nash embarked on a successful theater tour accompanied only by their acoustic guitars and a piano, as captured on the 1998 archival release ''[[Another Stoney Evening]]''.

1972 proved to be another fruitful year for all the band members in their solo or duo efforts. Young achieved solo superstardom with the chart-topping ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' and two Top 40 singles, the #1 hit "[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]" and "[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]" (#31). Stills joined with former Byrd [[Chris Hillman]] to form the band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]], releasing a self-titled double album; although it did not generate any significant hits, counting the three CSN/CSNY records, ''[[Manassas (album)|Manassas]]'' became Stills's sixth Top Ten album in a row, peaking at No. 4 and being certified gold in the US a month after release. Nash and Young released Young's "[[War Song]]" as a joint single to support [[George McGovern]]'s presidential campaign; despite their intentions, the single failed to make a serious impression. Meanwhile, Nash's and Crosby's touring was so successful and pleasant for them that they recorded and released their first album as a duo, ''[[Graham Nash David Crosby]]'', which eclipsed their recent solo efforts with a Top 40 hit (Nash's "[[Immigration Man]]", #36); it peaked at No. 4 and was certified gold in the US.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 151</ref>

The group members fared less well in 1973. Young recorded two dark albums. The first, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'', chronicled his winter tour that followed the death of his Crazy Horse bandmate [[Danny Whitten]] from an alcohol/[[Valium]] overdose, a tour Crosby and Nash joined mid-way. A critical success despite his personal misgivings, it attained a RIAA gold certification before stalling at No. 22. The second album, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'', inspired by the death of CSNY roadie Bruce Berry, was so dark that [[Reprise Records]] refused to release it until 1975. Although it is widely regarded as his [[magnum opus]], it only reached No. 25. Crosby spearheaded and produced a [[Byrds (album)|reunion album]] of the original Byrds quintet which was a notable critical failure upon its release in March 1973. The most commercially successful Byrds album since 1966, it sold only marginally well by CSNY's standards, peaking at No. 20. Stills released a [[Down the Road (Manassas album)|second Manassas record]] in April 1973 and Nash recorded his second solo album ''[[Wild Tales (album)|Wild Tales]]'' (released in January 1974); again, neither disc sold to expectations, peaking respectively at No. 26 and No. 34. Apart from ''Time Fades Away'', none of the CSNY-related albums in 1973 were certified gold in the US, a first for the band.

===CSNY, reconciliation and further estrangement: 1973–1976===
[[Image:CSNY 8-1974 (1).jpg|thumb|right|Stills (left), Crosby and Nash in 1974]]

In June and July 1973, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young met at Young's ranch in California and a recording studio in Hawaii for a working vacation, ostensibly to record a new album, tentatively titled ''[[Human Highway (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|Human Highway]]''. However, the bickering that had sunk the band in 1970 quickly resumed, scattering the group again. After spontaneously reconvening for an acoustic set at a Manassas concert at San Francisco's [[Winterland Ballroom]] in October, the quartet failed once again to commit to a reunion; however, three days later, the CSN configuration performed an acoustic set at another Manassas Winterland show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-04-1973.html|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert|website=Concertvault.com|access-date=September 20, 2017|archive-date=September 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921000504/http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-04-1973.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-07-1973.html|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert|website=Concertvault.com|access-date=September 20, 2017|archive-date=September 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921000506/http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-07-1973.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Over the next few months, Roberts finally prevailed upon the group to realize their commercial potential, culminating in Stills announcing a CSNY summer tour and the projected studio album at a solo concert in March 1974.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRB6NnYW7_IC&q=%22big+tour%22|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|date=September 23, 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780786726110|via=Google Books}}</ref> The quartet [[CSNY 1974|reassembled]] in earnest that summer, with sidemen [[Tim Drummond]] on bass, [[Russ Kunkel]] on drums, and [[Joe Lala]] on percussion, to rehearse at Young's ranch near [[Woodside, California]] before embarking on the two-month, 31-date tour.

The tour was directed by San Francisco-based impresario [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]. Opening acts consisted of well known performers, including Joni Mitchell (who occasionally sat in during the acoustic and semi-acoustic interlude that bridged two electric sets), [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[the Band]], [[the Beach Boys]], and [[Jesse Colin Young]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p.; 173</ref> The band typically played up to three and a half hours of old favorites and new songs. Crosby, in particular,  was disillusioned by the bombastic nature of the performances, which he collectively dubbed the "Doom Tour": "We had good monitors, but Stephen and Neil were punching well over 100 db from their half stacks. Graham and I simply couldn't do the harmonies when we couldn't hear ourselves. Also, when you play a stadium you almost have to do a [[Mick Jagger]] where you wave a sash around and prance about. I can't quite do that. We did what we could, but I don't know how many people in the audience really got it. A lot of them were there for the tunes.

[[File:CSNY Norfolk Virginia Aug 27 1974.jpg|thumb|right|Crosby, Stills & Young outdoor stadium tour at [[Foreman Field]], [[Old Dominion University]], Norfolk&nbsp;VA. (August 17, 1974)]]

While the foursome would have the press believe that their characteristic arguments were a thing of the past, excesses typical to the era took their toll. Under the stewardship of Graham's production company, the tour was plagued by profligate spending, exemplified by pillowcases embroidered with the band's new Mitchell-designed logo and the routine chartering of helicopters and private jets in lieu of ground transportation. Nash later recalled that "the tour made just over eleven million dollars, which of course was a lot of money in those days. We all got less than a half million each. It was obvious that between Bill Graham, the promoters and a bunch of others, they all had a good time. Let's just put it that way."<ref name="rollingstone.com"/> According to road manager Chris O'Dell, "One time they spilled cocaine on the carpet. They just got down on the floor and sniffed it off the carpet. I just went, 'Oh my God, this is so weird.' I'd never seen anything like it. They probably don't remember that."<ref name="rollingstone.com"/> The relatively abstemious Nash "started taking [[Percocet]] and [[Percodan]]. I call them 'I Don't Give A Shit' pills.

Stills—who befuddled his colleagues by claiming to have participated in clandestine [[Vietnam War]] missions as a member of the [[United States Marine Corps]] during his tenure in Buffalo Springfield—began supplementing his trademark wardrobe of football jerseys with military fatigues while performing and fraternizing with his personal manager, [[Green Berets]] veteran Michael John Bowen.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Joseph Hudak |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/10-classic-drugged-out-performances-from-santana-to-green-day-20130606/8-crosby-stills-nash-and-young-at-wembley-stadium-1974-cocaine-0467579 |title=8.

This chagrined several employees and band members; according to Nash, "Often I would knock on his hotel door, which he kept propped open with a security jamb, and he'd be getting [[fellatio|blown]] by both of those girls, all while he was talking and doing business on the phone and rolling joints and smoking and having a drink. Crosby had incredible sexual energy. It got to be such a routine scene in his room, I'd stop by with someone and go, "Aw, fuck, he's getting blown again.

Although each member performed new songs that later appeared on solo and duo studio releases, Young premiered more than a dozen songs (including several from ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On The Beach]]'', which was released during the tour) in one of the most creatively fertile phases of his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sugarmtn.org/year.php?year=1974 |title=Sugar Mountain – Neil Young Set Lists |publisher=Sugarmtn.org |access-date=August 24, 2015 |archive-date=September 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922092249/http://www.sugarmtn.org/year.php?year=1974 |url-status=live }}</ref> Vexed by the diminished prolificacy of the trio, he isolated himself from the group, travelling separately in an RV with his son and entourage. He later asserted to biographer [[Jimmy McDonough]] that "the tour was disappointing to me. I think CSN really blew it... they hadn't made an album, and they didn't have any songs. How could they just stop like that?"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrd20PZoLFYC&q=1974 |title=Shakey: Neil Young's Biography – Jimmy McDonough – Google Books |date= May 13, 2003|isbn=9781400075447 |access-date=August 24, 2015|last1=McDonough |first1=Jimmy |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing }}</ref> Atlantic Records issued the compilation ''[[So Far (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|So Far]]'' to have something to promote during the tour. While Nash viewed the re-shuffling of items from only two albums and one single (typified by the exclusion of his "Marrakesh Express", a Top 40 hit) as absurd, it eventually topped the ''Billboard'' album chart in November.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 176</ref>

Surmounting Young's interpersonal distance and new ebbs in their respective relationships with Stills, the quartet reconvened with [[The Albert Brothers]] at Rudy Records (Nash's San Francisco home studio) in November to finish the long-gestating follow-up to ''Déjà Vu''. Renewed tensions were exacerbated by the relatively incommodious basement space, prompting the group to soon relocate to the [[Record Plant]] in nearby [[Sausalito, California]]. While several songs were completed and recorded (including Young's "Human Highway"; a take of Crosby's "Homeward Through the Haze" with the singer-songwriter on piano and [[Lee Sklar]] on bass; and Nash's [[anti-whaling]] opus "Wind on the Water"), Young left once again following a tumultuous argument. As the remaining members (augmented by a variety of session musicians, including Sklar and Kunkel) attempted to complete the album under the CSN name, the feud between Stills and Nash resurfaced, resulting in Stills destroying the master of "Wind on the Water" with a razor blade after Crosby and Nash objected to a harmony part on Stills's "Guardian Angel". Even though Stills characterized the incident as a joke, the sessions promptly dissolved.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRB6NnYW7_IC&q=homeward+through+the+haze|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|date=September 23, 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780786726110|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Shortly thereafter, Crosby and Nash signed a separate contract with [[ABC Records]] and began to tour regularly again, playing a more intimate array of sports arenas, outdoor festivals and theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.setlist.fm/search?query=artist:%28Crosby+%26+Nash%29+date:%5B1975-01-01+TO+1975-12-31%5D |title=Search for setlists: artist:(Crosby & Nash) date:[1975-01-01 TO 1975-12-31 |publisher=setlist.fm |access-date=August 24, 2015 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050850/http://www.setlist.fm/search?query=artist:(Crosby+%26+Nash)+date:%5B1975-01-01+TO+1975-12-31%5D |url-status=live }}</ref> During this period they produced two studio albums, ''[[Wind on the Water]]'' (No. 6) in 1975 and ''[[Whistling Down the Wire]]'' (No. 26) in 1976 (both being certified gold in the US), and the 1977 concert album ''[[Crosby-Nash Live]]'' (No. 52). Along with Drummond (retained from the 1974 CSNY tour), they continued to use the sidemen from the ensemble known as [[The Section (band)|The Section]] from their first LP. This crack session group (wryly rechristened The Mighty Jitters by Crosby in a nod to the era's endemic cocaine use) contributed to records by myriad other Los Angeles-based artists in the seventies, such as [[Carole King]], [[James Taylor]], and [[Jackson Browne]]. Throughout the mid-70s, Crosby and Nash also lent their harmonies to a range of recordings, including Taylor's "Mexico", Joni Mitchell's "[[Free Man in Paris]]" and [[Elton John]]'s ''[[Blue Moves]]''.

Meanwhile, Stills and Young returned to their own careers. Stills released [[Stills (Stephen Stills album)|an eponymous album]] in June 1975 (No. 19), a live album in December 1975 (''[[Stephen Stills Live]]'', No. 42) and in May 1976 another studio album (''[[Illegal Stills]]'', No. 31). Young, in 1975, belatedly released ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' at the recommendation of Band bassist/vocalist [[Rick Danko]] (No. 25) and thence ''[[Zuma (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Zuma]]'' (No. 25), a new album primarily recorded with Crazy Horse that also featured one song recorded by CSNY in the June 1974 sessions. None of these solo albums initially attained RIAA certification in the United States, although ''Zuma'' was ultimately certified gold in 1997. Following the lead of Crosby and Nash, they briefly united for a one-off album and tour credited to the Stills-Young Band, ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (1976, No. 26), which was certified gold in 1977. Although the [[Miami]]-based sessions for this album briefly metamorphosed into the third attempt at a CSNY reunion album, Stills and Young wiped the vocal contributions of the other pair off the [[master recording|master tape]] when Crosby & Nash were obligated to leave the sessions to finish ''Whistling Down the Wire'' in Los Angeles.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pp. 185–6</ref> As Stills and Young embarked on a tour to promote the album in the summer of 1976, the old tensions between the pair resurfaced, exemplified by Stills's insistence that professional studio musicians back them rather than Young's preferred Crazy Horse. After a July 20, 1976, show in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], Young's tour bus took a different direction from Stills'. Waiting at their next stop in [[Atlanta]], Stills received a laconic telegram: "Dear Stephen, Funny how things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach. Neil."<ref>McDonough, pp. 501–2</ref> Young's management claimed that he was under doctor's orders to rest and recover from an apparent throat infection, though he made up dates with Crazy Horse later in the year. Stills was contractually bound to finish the tour alone.

===CSN reform: 1976–1985===
Later in 1976, Stills approached Crosby and Nash during a performance at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] in Los Angeles, setting the stage for the return of the trio.

Less than a year after reforming, Crosby, Stills & Nash released ''[[CSN (album)|CSN]]''. Recorded at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami under the aegis of Ron and Howard Albert throughout late 1976 and early 1977, the album exemplified the meticulously stylized [[soft rock]] production ethos of the epoch and contained the band's highest-charting single, Nash's "[[Just a Song Before I Go]]" (#7); Stills's "Fair Game" also peaked at #43. The album peaked at No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' chart in the summer of 1977 during a 33-week stay, remaining at that position for the month of August (behind one of the best-selling LPs of all time, [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'') and ultimately earning a RIAA [[platinum album|quadruple platinum]] certification.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/csn-mw0000676437/awards |title=CSN – Crosby, Stills & Nash &#124; Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=June 17, 1977 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-date=March 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310145649/http://www.allmusic.com/album/csn-mw0000676437/awards |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database|title=Gold & Platinum – RIAA|website=Riaa.com|access-date=September 24, 2016|archive-date=January 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103185214/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database|url-status=live}}</ref> As of 2017, it remains the trio configuration's best-selling album, outselling their debut by 200,000 records.<ref name="greasylake.org"/>

On June 21, 1978, Crosby, Stills & Nash received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for their contributions to the music industry, located at 6666 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/crosby-stills-and-nash|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=Walkoffame.com|access-date=December 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219004954/http://www.walkoffame.com/crosby-stills-and-nash|archive-date=February 19, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/crosby-stills-nash/|title=Crosby Stills & Nash – Hollywood Star Walk|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=December 1, 2016|archive-date=December 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202034527/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/crosby-stills-nash/|url-status=live}}</ref>

After successful arena tours in 1977 and 1978, further work as a group was complicated by Crosby's newfound dependence on [[crack cocaine|freebase cocaine]]. ''[[Earth & Sky (album)|Earth & Sky]]'', a 1980 Nash album that failed to chart in the Top 100, was envisaged as a Crosby & Nash project (itself spawned by aborted 1978 CSN sessions) until Nash determined that Crosby was not in shape to participate after his colleague stopped a jam because his freebase pipe had fallen off of an amp and broken.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 314</ref>

Juxtaposing recent [[disco]]-inflected material (including the [[Andy Gibb]] showcase "What's the Game" and "Can't Get No Booty", co-written with [[Danny Kortchmar]] during a lull in the 1978 CSN sessions) against more conventional acoustic and blues rock arrangements (such as the Manassas-era title track), Stills's ''[[Thoroughfare Gap]]'' stalled at No. 83 following its release in October 1978. Stills's 1979 support tour with the California Blues Band (including a performance at the historic [[Havana Jam]]) was dominated by theater bookings and largely overshadowed by such tabloid-friendly stories as a brawl with [[Elvis Costello]] (instigated by the younger singer-songwriter's use of the word [[nigger]] in deprecatory assessments of [[James Brown]] and [[Ray Charles]])<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/elvis-costello-racist-remarks/ |title=That Time Elvis Costello Incited a Brawl With Racist Remarks |work=Ultimateclassicrock.com |last=Wawzenek |first=Bryan |date=March 15, 2015 |access-date=July 30, 2021 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316153854/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/elvis-costello-racist-remarks/ |archive-date=March 16, 2014 }}</ref> amid his brief engagement to television actress [[Susan St. James]], reflecting his diminished critical and commercial stature. The tour's opening concerts at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] in Los Angeles marked Stills's final full performances with onetime key collaborator Dallas Taylor, by then long addicted to heroin and cocaine. After entering recovery in 1985, Taylor worked as an interventionist and [[sober companion]] until his death in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thefix.com/content/dallas-taylor-1948-2015 |title=Farewell Dallas Taylor, CSNY Drummer and Recovery Advocate |website=The Fix |last=Greenwald |first=Matthew |date=February 2, 2015 |access-date=July 30, 2021 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203212959/http://www.thefix.com:80/content/dallas-taylor-1948-2015 |archive-date=February 3, 2015 }}</ref>

With little recourse and a rapport that still evinced strain from the Rita Coolidge affair, Stills and Nash convened in 1980–1981 to record ''[[Daylight Again]]'' as a self-funded duo; however, Atlantic Records executives (led by Ahmet Ertegun, who seldom intervened in the band's affairs) refused to reimburse their expenses or release the LP until Crosby was reinstated.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 353–4</ref> Crosby contributed "Delta" (his last original composition for several years) and a cover of [[Judy Henske]]'s and [[Craig Doerge]]'s "Might as Well Have a Good Time" along with some additional vocals on other tracks. Despite Crosby's condition and the relatively démodé nature of the group in the wake of the ascendancy of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[contemporary R&B]], ''Daylight Again'' reached No. 8 in 1982 during a 41-week chart stay. The album contained two major hits: Nash's "Wasted on the Way" (#9) and Stills's "[[Southern Cross (Crosby, Stills and Nash song)|Southern Cross]]" (#18); Stills's "Too Much Love to Hide" also charted at #69. While the album ultimately failed to sell as well as its predecessors in the new musical climate, it received a RIAA platinum certification in early 1983.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/daylight-again-mw0000189646/awards |title=Daylight Again – Crosby, Stills & Nash &#124; Awards |website=AllMusic |date=June 21, 1982 |access-date=July 10, 2014 |archive-date=October 1, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001172403/http://www.allmusic.com/album/daylight-again-mw0000189646/awards |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=daylight%20again#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum|publisher=RIAA|access-date=April 8, 2017|archive-date=December 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211226101149/https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=daylight%20again#search_section|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although the success of ''Daylight Again'' inaugurated a new tradition of near-annual touring that persisted for over thirty years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/stats/crosby-stills-and-nash-33d6f8a1.html|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash Tour Statistics|website=Setlist.fm|access-date=September 24, 2016|archive-date=December 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211226101200/https://www.setlist.fm/stats/crosby-stills-and-nash-33d6f8a1.html|url-status=live}}</ref> the bottom soon fell out for Crosby, who was arrested and jailed on drug and weapons charges in [[Texas]] in May 1982. Having recorded a potential title song for the film ''[[WarGames]]'' that was never used, the band released it as a single and hastily assembled concert recordings around two studio tracks for the album ''[[Allies (CSN album)|Allies]]'', their lowest-charting record to date. Crosby was sentenced to two terms, but the conviction was overturned; arrested several more times, he finally turned himself in to the authorities in December 1985.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 438–9</ref> He spent eight months in prison.

===CSNY again: 1988–2015===
Based on a promise he made to Crosby should he clean himself up, Young agreed to rejoin the trio in the studio upon Crosby's release from prison for ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9aLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA318|page=318|title=CSNY: Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young|author=Peter Doggett|publisher=Simon and Schuster|date= April 2, 2019|isbn=9781501183027}}</ref> Stills and Crosby (enfeebled by health problems from his fallow period that culminated in a 1994 liver transplant) were barely functioning for the making of the album, and the late eighties production completely swamped the band.<ref>McDonough, p. 625</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7n38EhI2JaoC&q=stills+freebase+american+dream&pg=PA263 |title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young ... – Barney Hoskyns – Google Books |date= December 9, 2010|isbn=9781118040508 |access-date=July 10, 2014|last1=Hoskyns |first1=Barney |publisher=Wiley }}</ref> It did make it to No. 16 on the ''Billboard'' chart during a 22-week stay, but the record received poor critical notices, and Young refused to support it with a CSNY tour. The band did produce a video for Young's title-song single, wherein each member played a character loosely based on certain aspects of their personalities and public image. Several years later, CSNY reunited to play the Bill Graham memorial concert ("Laughter, Love and Music") at [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco on November 3, 1991.

CSN recorded two more studio albums in the 1990s, ''[[Live It Up (CSN album)|Live It Up]]'' (1990) and ''[[After the Storm (CSN album)|After the Storm]]'' (1994); both albums sold poorly by previous standards and failed to attain RIAA certifications. A [[CSN (box set)|box set]] arrived in 1991, four [[compact disc|discs]] of expected group highlights amidst unexpected better tracks from various solo projects. Owing to certain difficulties, manager Roberts, no longer with the trio but still representing Young, pulled most of Young's material earmarked for the box. Ultimately, nineteen tracks out of the seventy-seven in the set were credited to CSNY. Intended for inclusion, the 1976 CSNY version of "Human Highway" was leaked to the internet several years later<ref>McDonough, p. 248</ref> before receiving an official release on the ''[[Neil Young Archives Volume II: 1972–1976]]'' box set in 2020.

In 1994, CSN collaborated with [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Alison Krauss]], and [[Kathy Mattea]] to contribute "[[Teach Your Children]]" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

By the late 1990s, CSN found themselves without a record contract. They began financing recordings themselves, and in 1999 Stills invited Young to guest on a few tracks. Impressed by their gumption, Young increased his level of input, turning the album into a CSNY project, ''[[Looking Forward]]''. The album was released at Young's behest{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} via [[Reprise Records]] in October 1999. With writing credits mostly limited to band members, the disc was better received than the previous three albums from a critical standpoint. It also fared relatively well commercially, peaking at No. 26 (the group's highest chart placement since ''American Dream'') during a 9-week stay. However, in a reflection of the shifting financial landscape of the music industry, ''Looking Forward'' was most notable for laying the groundwork for the ensuing CSNY2K Tour (2000) and the CSNY Tour of America (2002), both of which were major money-makers.

CSN were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997; CSNY is the first band to have all its members inducted into the hall twice, although Young was inducted for his solo work (1995) and for Buffalo Springfield (1997). A year later, in 1998, CSN were inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash|url=http://vocalgroup.org/inductees/crosby-stills-nash/|access-date=2022-01-14|website=The Vocal Group Hall of Fame|language=en-US|archive-date=January 14, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220114000124/http://vocalgroup.org/inductees/crosby-stills-nash/|url-status=live}}</ref> The CSN logo that Crosby, Stills and Nash used from the mid-1970s onward was designed by actor and comedian [[Phil Hartman]] during his first career as a graphic designer.

Various compilations of the band's configurations have arrived over the years, the box set being the most comprehensive, and ''So Far'' being the most commercially successful. Individual retrospective box sets have also been released. In 2007, David Crosby's ''Voyage'' chronicled his work with various bands and as a solo artist. Graham Nash's ''Reflections'' appeared in early 2009 under the same auspices, quite near his 67th birthday. The box set for Stephen Stills, ''[[Carry On (Stephen Stills album)|Carry On]]'', was released in February 2013. Compilation and oversight of these releases has largely been managed by Nash.<ref>[http://www.4waysite.com/index5.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211015258/http://www.4waysite.com/index5.htm|date=December 11, 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young set off on their Freedom of Speech Tour in support of ''[[Living with War]]'', a Young solo album written in response to the [[Iraq War]]. The long setlists included the bulk of the new protest album as well as material from Stills's long-delayed solo album ''[[Man Alive!

The trio performed "Teach Your Children" on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on July 30, 2008, with host [[Stephen Colbert]] filling in the fourth harmony (Neil Young's portion) and wearing a Young-mocking outfit and being referred to by Nash as "Neil". In 2009, Crosby, Stills & Nash released ''[[Demos (CSN album)|Demos]]'', an album made up of demo recordings of popular group and solo songs. In June 2009 Crosby, Stills and Nash performed at the [[Glastonbury Festival]].

CSN convened with producer [[Rick Rubin]] to record a projected covers album (tentatively titled ''Songs We Wish We'd Written'') for [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 2010; seven songs were completed before the dissolution of the sessions due to the increasingly acrimonious relationship between Rubin and Crosby, who perceived the former as a disruptive and autocratic figure in the creative process.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/graham-nash-says-csn-sessions-with-rick-rubin-were-contentious-20120726 |title=Graham Nash Says CSN Sessions With Rick Rubin Were Contentious |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=July 26, 2012 |access-date=August 24, 2015 |archive-date=August 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820040403/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/graham-nash-says-csn-sessions-with-rick-rubin-were-contentious-20120726 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By 2012, CSN had completed five self-produced re-recordings in anticipation of a potential rights dispute over the Rubin sessions with Sony.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/crosby-stills-nash-covers-album-restart/ |title=Crosby, Stills and Nash Resume Work on Covers Album |date=June 26, 2014 |publisher=Ultimateclassicrock.com |access-date=August 24, 2015 |archive-date=September 19, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919070348/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/crosby-stills-nash-covers-album-restart/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.4waysite.com/news-rumors-2014/ |title=4WAYSITE |publisher=4WAYSITE |access-date=August 24, 2015 |archive-date=August 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820001955/http://www.4waysite.com/news-rumors-2014/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Political activism==
[[File:CSNY diromg 2006 tour.jpg|thumb|CSNY during their 2006 tour; L to R: [[Graham Nash]], Tom Bray, [[Stephen Stills]], [[Neil Young]], [[Rick Rosas]], and [[David Crosby]]]]

CSNY's music reflected the tastes and viewpoints of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. With protest against the [[Vietnam War]] gearing up in 1970, the group (and Crosby in particular) made no secret of their political leanings.

As a group, they recorded one hit song in response to political events although they recorded other political songs as solo artists and in various combinations.  The song, "Ohio", was written in response to the [[Kent State shootings|deaths of four students at Kent State University]].

Between "Ohio", their appearance in both the festival and movie of ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'', and the runaway success of their two albums, the group found themselves in the position of enjoying a level of adulation far greater than experienced with their previous bands, as evidenced by the 27 Platinum certifications they received across seven albums.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The band has been continuously associated with political causes throughout its existence, the latest example being the song "Almost Gone (The Ballad of Bradley Manning)" which focuses on the length and conditions of [[Chelsea Manning]]'s pre-trial confinement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/crosby-stills-nash-playing-hard-rock-148226345.html|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash playing Hard Rock|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=April 20, 2012|archive-date=April 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423140223/http://www.lvrj.com/neon/crosby-stills-nash-playing-hard-rock-148226345.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Legacy and influence==
{{expand section|date=August 2019}}
Allison Rapp of ''[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]'' conferred the title of the "folk rockiest of all the folk rock bands" on Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rapp |first=Allison|date=2024-08-28 |title=Who Are the 'Big 4' of Folk Rock? |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/big-4-folk-rock/?utm_source=tsmclip&utm_medium=referral |access-date=2025-03-22 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |language=en}}</ref>

The band's collective abilities allowed CSNY to straddle all the [[genre]]s of popular music eminent at the time, from [[country rock]] to confessional ballads, from acoustic guitars and voice to electric guitar, and three-part harmony. With the Beatles' break-up made public by April 1970, and with [[Bob Dylan]] in reclusive low-key activity since mid-1966, CSNY found themselves the adopted standard bearers for the [[Woodstock Nation]], serving an importance in society as counterculture figureheads, equaled at the time in rock and roll only by [[the Rolling Stones]] or [[the Who]]. Such was their standing in 1970 that Bill Graham referred to them as "The American Beatles".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Browne|first=David|title=Fire and Rain: The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, James Taylor, CSNY, and the Lost Story of 1970|year=2004}}</ref> Producer [[Peter Fonda]] wanted CSN to create the soundtrack for ''[[Easy Rider]]'', but director [[Dennis Hopper]] nixed the idea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/easy-rider-soundtrack/ |title=45 Years Ago: 'Easy Rider' Soundtrack Roars With Rock Hits |date=July 14, 2014 |publisher=Ultimateclassicrock.com |access-date=August 24, 2015 |archive-date=September 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922061737/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/easy-rider-soundtrack/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Stills's composition, "[[Ohio (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Find the Cost of Freedom]]" (on the flip side of "Ohio"), was the only song known to be offered for the soundtrack.
