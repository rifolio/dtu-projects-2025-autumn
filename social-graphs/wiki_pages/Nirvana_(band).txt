'''Nirvana''' was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Aberdeen, Washington]], in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]], the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably [[Chad Channing]], before recruiting [[Dave Grohl]] in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized [[alternative rock]], and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of [[Generation X]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-17 |title=Nivrana: A Tribute to Nirvana, September 27 |url=https://www.rcreader.com/music/nivrana-nirvana-tribute-redstone-room-sep27 |access-date=2025-01-06 |website=www.rcreader.com |language=en}}</ref> Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence rock culture.

In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle [[grunge]] scene. They released their first album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', for the independent record label [[Sub Pop]] in 1989. Their sound relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to the major label [[DGC Records]] in 1990, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", the first single from its landmark second album, ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, ''Nevermind'' was certified [[Diamond certification|diamond]] and is credited for ending the popularity of [[hair metal]].<ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/12/nirvana-kill-hair-metal|title=Nirvana kill hair metal|first=Keith|last=Cameron|work=The Guardian |date=June 11, 2011|accessdate=February 23, 2025}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/grunge-killed-ended-hair-metal/|title=How Grunge Killed Hair Metal|first=Lauryn|last=Schaffner|date=June 14, 2019|website=Loudwire|accessdate=February 23, 2025}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/myth-grunge-killed-hair-metal/|title=Dispelling the myth that grunge killed hair metal|date=January 10, 2022|website=faroutmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=February 23, 2025}}</ref>

Characterized by a [[Punk subculture|punk]] aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of [[Pop music|pop]] melodies with [[Noise music|noise]], combined with its themes of [[abjection]] and [[social alienation]], brought them global popularity. Following extensive touring and the 1992 compilation album ''[[Incesticide]]'' and EP ''[[Hormoaning]]'', the band released its highly anticipated third studio album, ''[[In Utero]]'' (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain's suicide]] in April 1994. Further releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow, [[Courtney Love]]. The live album ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]'' (1994) won [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Performance]] at the [[1996 Grammy Awards]].

Nirvana is one of [[list of best-selling music artists|the best-selling bands]] of all time, having sold more than 75&nbsp;million records worldwide. During its three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an [[American Music Awards|American Music Award]], [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]], and [[Grammy Award]], as well as seven [[MTV Video Music Award]]s and two [[NME Awards]]. The band achieved five number-one hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs]] chart and four number-one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In 2010, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Nirvana No. 30 in its list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446/nirvana-15-92089/ |title=100 Greatest Artists |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=December 3, 2010 |access-date=January 14, 2025}}</ref> They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2014, their first year of eligibility.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2014-04-11 |title=Nirvana inducted to Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26985223 |access-date=2025-01-06 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}</ref> In 2023, they received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

=== 1987–1988: Formation and early years ===
Singer and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] met while attending [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]] in Washington state.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 209</ref> The pair became friends while frequenting the practice space of the [[Melvins]].<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 36</ref> Cobain wanted to form a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not respond for a long period. Cobain gave him a demo tape of his project [[Fecal Matter (band)|Fecal Matter]]. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. Their first band, the Sellouts, was a [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] tribute band.<ref>{{cite news |title=Everybody Loves John Fogerty |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/09/04/217281876/everyone-loves-john-fogerty |access-date=January 4, 2020 |work=NPR |date=September 4, 2013 |archive-date=April 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200425145921/https://www.npr.org/2013/09/04/217281876/everyone-loves-john-fogerty |url-status=live}}</ref> The project featured Novoselic on guitar and vocals, Cobain on drums, and Steve Newman on bass but only lasted a short time.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 54–55</ref> Another project, this time featuring originals, was also attempted in late 1986.

=== 1988–1990: Early releases ===
Nirvana released its first single, a cover of [[Shocking Blue]]'s "[[Love Buzz#Nirvana cover version|Love Buzz]]", in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label [[Sub Pop]].<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 85</ref> They did their first interview with [[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]] in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', which made their release its single of the week. The following month, the band began recording its debut album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', with local producer [[Jack Endino]].<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 90–1</ref> ''Bleach'' was influenced by the heavy dirge-rock of the Melvins, the 1980s punk rock of [[Mudhoney]], and the 1970s [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] of [[Black Sabbath]].<ref>Fricke, David. "Krist Novoselic". ''Rolling Stone''. September 13, 2001.</ref> The money for the recording sessions for ''Bleach'', listed as {{USD|606.17|long=No}} on the album sleeve, was supplied by [[Jason Everman]], who was subsequently brought into the band as the second guitarist. Though Everman did not play on the album, he received a credit on ''Bleach'' because, according to Novoselic, they "wanted to make him feel more at home in the band".<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 91–2</ref> Prior to the album's release, Nirvana became the first band to sign an extended contract with Sub Pop.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 110–11</ref>

''Bleach'' was released in June 1989, and became a favorite of [[college radio]] stations.

You're kidding me'."<ref>''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', October 2010</ref>

=== 1991–1992: ''Nevermind'' and mainstream breakthrough ===
Disenchanted with Sub Pop, and with the Smart Studios sessions generating interest, Nirvana sought a deal with a major record label since no indie label could buy them out of their contract.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 136–37</ref> Cobain and Novoselic consulted [[Soundgarden]] and [[Alice in Chains]] manager [[Susan Silver]] for advice.<ref name="etruebio">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byoPYMdJ150C&pg=PA191 |title=Nirvana: The Biography |first=Everett |last=True |publisher=Da Capo Press |pages=191–192 |date=March 13, 2007 |isbn=9780786733903 |access-date=January 10, 2020 |archive-date=April 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422200921/https://books.google.com/books?id=byoPYMdJ150C&pg=PA191 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="crcross">{{cite book|first=Charles R.|last=Cross|author-link=Charles R.

After signing, the band began recording its first major label album, ''[[Nevermind]]''. The group was offered a number of producers, but held out for Vig.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 164–65</ref> Rather than record at Vig's Madison studio as they had in 1990, production shifted to [[Sound City Studios]] in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles]], California. For two months, the band worked through a variety of songs. Some, such as "[[In Bloom]]" and "Breed", had been in Nirvana's repertoire for years, while others, including "[[On a Plain]]" and "Stay Away", lacked finished lyrics until midway through the recording process.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. pp. 176–77</ref> After the recording sessions were completed, Vig and the band set out to [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] the album. However, the recording sessions had run behind schedule and the resulting mixes were deemed unsatisfactory. [[Slayer]] mixer [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]] was brought in to create the final mix. After the album's release, members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound that Wallace had given ''Nevermind''.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. pp. 179–80</ref>

''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. April 1993.</ref> However, the first single, "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", quickly gained momentum, boosted by major airplay of the music video on [[MTV]]. As it toured Europe during late 1991, the band found that its shows were dangerously oversold, that television crews were becoming a constant presence onstage, and that "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was almost omnipresent on radio and music television.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 203</ref> By Christmas 1991, ''Nevermind'' was selling 400,000 copies a week in the US.<ref>Lyons, James.

Citing exhaustion, Nirvana did not undertake another American tour in support of ''Nevermind'', and made only a handful of performances later that year.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 256</ref> In March 1992, Cobain sought to reorganize the group's songwriting royalties (which to this point had been split equally) to better represent that he wrote the majority of the music. Grohl and Novoselic did not object, but when Cobain wanted the agreement to be retroactive to the release of ''Nevermind'', the disagreements came close to breaking up the band. After a week of tension, Cobain received a retroactive share of 75 percent of the royalties. Bad feelings about the situation remained within the group afterward.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 257–58</ref>

Cobain described Nirvana's initial sound as "a [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and [[Scratch Acid]] ripoff".<ref name="Azerrad, 1994. p. 294">Azerrad, 1994. p. 294</ref> When Nirvana recorded ''Bleach'', Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the Sub Pop grunge sound to build a fanbase, and suppressed his arty and pop songwriting in favor of a more rock sound.<ref name="Az 102">Azerrad, 1994. p. 102</ref> Nirvana biographer [[Michael Azerrad]] argued, "Ironically, it was the restrictions of the Sub Pop sound that helped the band find its musical identity." Azerrad stated that by acknowledging that they had grown up listening to [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Aerosmith]], they had been able to move on from their derivative early sound.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 103</ref>

Nirvana used dynamic shifts that went from quiet to loud.<ref name="FrickeRS1994" /> Cobain sought to mix heavy and pop musical sounds, saying, "I wanted to be totally [[Led Zeppelin]] in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and then do real wimpy pop songs." When Cobain heard the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]' 1988 album, ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'', after recording ''Bleach'', he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but had been too intimidated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 103–4</ref> Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between "spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals".<ref>Kanter, L.A. "Kurt Cobain's Well-Tempered Tantrums". ''Guitar Player''. February 1992.</ref> Near the end of his life, Cobain said the band had become bored of the "limited" formula, but expressed doubt that they were skilled enough to try other dynamics.<ref name="FrickeRS1994" />
[[File:Kurt Cobain Smashed Guitar MOPOP.jpg|thumb|Bottom half of guitar smashed by Kurt Cobain, displayed at [[Museum of Pop Culture|MOPOP]]]]

===Instrumentation===
Cobain's rhythm guitar style, which relied on [[power chord]]s, low-note riffs, and a loose left-handed technique, featured the key components to the band's songs. Cobain would often initially play a song's verse riff in a clean tone, then double it with distorted guitars when he repeated the part. In some verses, the guitar would be absent to allow the drums and bass guitar to support the vocals, or it would only play sparse melodies like the two-note pattern used in "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Cobain rarely played standard guitar solos, opting to play variations of the song's melody as single-note lines. Cobain's solos were mostly blues-based and discordant, which music writer Jon Chappell described as "almost an iconoclastic parody of the traditional instrumental break", a quality typified by the note-for-note replication of the lead melody in "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and the atonal solo for "Breed".<ref name="Chappel">Chappell, Jon. "Nirvana's music". ''Guitar''. June 1993.</ref> The band had no formal musical training; Cobain said: "I have no concept of knowing how to be a musician at all whatsoever... I couldn't even pass Guitar 101."<ref>{{cite AV media |date=11 December 2013 |title=Kurt Cobain - Nirvana Rare Full Interview Seattle, 1993 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rhotCKLwcQ&t=1m57s |location=[[Seattle]] |time=1m 57s |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210423211808/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rhotCKLwcQ&t=1m57s |archive-date=23 April 2021 |access-date=13 May 2014}}</ref>

Grohl's drumming "took Nirvana's sound to a new level of intensity".<ref>di Perna, Alan. "Nevermore". ''Guitar World''. March 1999.</ref> Azerrad stated that Grohl's "powerful drumming propelled the band to a whole new plane, visually as well as musically", noting, "Although Dave is a merciless basher, his parts are also distinctly musical—it wouldn't be difficult to figure out what song he was playing even without the rest of the music".<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 231–32</ref>

Until early 1992, the band had performed live in [[concert pitch]]. They began tuning down either a half step or full step as well as concert pitch. Sometimes all three tunings would be in the same show. By the summer of that year, the band had settled on the half step down tuning ([[Guitar tunings#E♭ tuning|E♭]]).<ref name="requiem">Cross, Charles R. "Requiem for a Dream". ''Guitar World''. October 2001.</ref> Cobain said, "We play so hard we can't tune our guitars fast enough".<ref name="cheaptricks">Gilbert, Jeff. "Cheap Tricks". ''Guitar World''. February 1992.</ref> The band made a habit of destroying its equipment after shows. Novoselic said he and Cobain created the "shtick" in order to get off the stage sooner.<ref name="classicalbums">''Classic Albums—Nirvana: Nevermind'' [DVD]. Isis Productions, 2004.</ref> Cobain stated it began as an expression of his frustration with previous drummer Channing making mistakes and dropping out entirely during performances.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 140</ref>

=== Songwriting and lyrics ===
[[Everett True]] said in 1989, "Nirvana songs treat the banal and pedestrian with a unique slant".<ref>True, Everett. "Seattle: Rock City". ''[[Melody Maker]]''. March 18, 1989.</ref> Cobain came up with the basic components of each song, usually writing them on an acoustic guitar, as well as the singing style and the lyrics. He emphasized that Novoselic and Grohl had a large part in deciding the lengths and parts of songs, and that he did not like to be considered the sole songwriter.<ref name="making Nevermind">di Perna, Alan. "The Making of ''Nevermind''". ''Guitar World''. Fall 1996.</ref>

Cobain usually wrote lyrics for songs minutes before recording them.<ref name="making Nevermind" /> Cobain said, "When I write a song the lyrics are the least important subject. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all".<ref>Robb, John. "White Heat". ''Sounds''. October 21, 1989.</ref> Cobain told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 1993 that he "didn't give a flying f–k{{sic}}" what the lyrics on ''Bleach'' were about, figuring "Let's just scream negative lyrics, and as long as they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay", while the lyrics to ''Nevermind'' were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to ''In Utero'' were "more focused, they're almost built on themes".<ref name="steinke" /> Cobain did not write in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; he said, "I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [.. The songs are] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most people my age are."<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 210–11</ref>

In 1992, [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Nirvana had made other alternative acts impatient for similar success: "Suddenly, all bets are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions."

[[Michael Azerrad]] argued in his Nirvana biography ''[[Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana]]'' (1993) that ''Nevermind'' marked an epochal generational shift in music similar to the [[Rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] explosion in the 1950s and the end of the [[Baby boomers|baby boomer]] generation's dominance of the musical landscape. Azerrad wrote, "''Nevermind'' came along at exactly the right time. This was music by, for, and about a whole new group of young people who had been overlooked, ignored, or condescended to."<ref>Azerrad, 1994, p. 225</ref> [[Fugazi]] frontman [[Guy Picciotto]] said "It was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had ... It felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did."<ref>Azerrad, 2001. p. 493</ref>
