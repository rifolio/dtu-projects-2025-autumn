'''Theodore Anthony Nugent''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|uː|dʒ|ɪ|n|t}}; born December 13, 1948) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, and political activist.<ref>{{cite news |last= D'Angelo |first= Bob |date=April 21, 2021 |title= 'I thought I was dying': Ted Nugent Tests positive for COVID-19 |url= https://www.fox23.com/news/trending/i-thought-i-was-dying-ted-nugent-tests-positive-for-covid-19/article_43b22333-f651-5747-a920-e20b630395c0.html |work= fox23 |access-date= September 11, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Glor |first= Jeff |date=May 4, 2012 |title=Ted Nugent explodes at notion he's not a moderate|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ted-nugent-explodes-at-notion-hes-not-a-moderate/ |publisher= CBS News |access-date= September 11, 2023}}</ref> He goes by several nicknames, including '''Uncle Ted''', '''the Nuge''', and '''Motor City Madman'''. Nugent initially gained fame as the lead guitarist and occasional vocalist of [[The Amboy Dukes (band)|the Amboy Dukes]], a band formed in 1963 that played [[psychedelic rock]] and [[hard rock]]. After dissolving the band, he embarked on a successful solo career. His first three solo albums, ''[[Ted Nugent (album)|Ted Nugent]]'' (1975), ''[[Free-for-All (Ted Nugent album)|Free-for-All]]'' (1976) and ''[[Cat Scratch Fever]]'' (1977), as well as the live album ''[[Double Live Gonzo!]]'' (1978), were certified [[Platinum sales|multi-platinum]] in the United States. His latest album, ''Detroit Muscle'', was released in 2022. In 2023, he embarked on a farewell tour known as the "Adios Mofo Tour".

Nugent is known for his use of the [[Gibson Byrdland]], his bluesy and frenzied guitar playing, and his energetic live shows.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Moseley |first=Willie G. |url=http://www.vintageguitar.com/1971/ted-nugents-1962-gibson-byrdland/ |title=Ted Nugent's 1962 Gibson Byrdland  |magazine=Vintage Guitar|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://rockrollramble.medium.com/should-politics-be-kept-out-of-music-3bd7f7e743b3 | title=Should Politics be Kept Out of Music? | work=Medium | date=August 12, 2021 | last1=Ramble | first1=Rock }}</ref> Despite possessing a distinctive, wide-ranging singing voice, Nugent recorded and toured with other lead singers during much of his early solo career, including [[Derek St. Holmes]], [[Charlie Huhn]], [[Brian Howe (singer)|Brian Howe]] and [[Meat Loaf]], only taking on full lead vocal duties later on.<ref name="meatloaf">{{cite web |url=http://1041jackfm.cbslocal.com/2010/03/17/ted-nugent-paid-meatloaf-1000-to-sing-on-free-for-all-album/ |title=Ted Nugent Paid Meatloaf $1,000 To Sing on Free For All Album |date=March 17, 2010 |website=104.1 Jack FM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125152619/http://1041jackfm.cbslocal.com/2010/03/17/ted-nugent-paid-meatloaf-1000-to-sing-on-free-for-all-album/ |archive-date=November 25, 2015 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref> His biggest hit was 1977's "[[Cat Scratch Fever (song)|Cat Scratch Fever]]", on which he sang the lead vocals. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was part of the supergroup [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]].

Since the 2000s, Nugent has drawn attention for his outspoken [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political views and his vociferous advocacy of [[hunting]] and [[Gun politics in the United States|gun ownership]] rights.<ref name="Root">{{cite news|last=Root|first=Jay|title=Bearing Arms and Cranking Up the Controversy|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=21A|date=May 4, 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/us/hard-rocking-ted-nugent-cranks-up-the-controversy.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/ted-nugent-romney-expressed-support-controversial-comments/story?id=16276875 | title=Ted Nugent: Romney Camp 'Expressed Support' After Controversial Comments on Obama | date=May 4, 2012 | publisher=[[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]]|location=United States | access-date=February 14, 2013}}</ref> He was a board member of the [[National Rifle Association]] and is a strong supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

===Draft status===
Nugent grew up in a military family; his father was a career army sergeant. Nugent himself never served in the military, although he came of age during the height of the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1977 and 1990 interviews with ''[[High Times]]'' magazine and the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', Nugent claimed he deliberately failed his draft physical by eating nothing but junk food for days beforehand, and urinating and [[defecation|defecating]] in the same pair of pants for one week.<ref name=auto2>{{Cite news|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/nugent.asp|title=Ted Nugent Dodged the Draft?|date=April 20, 2012|website=Snopes.com|access-date=August 15, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=MM>{{cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/26/the-worst-ted-nugent-interview-of-all-time/198607|title=The Worst Ted Nugent Interview of All Time|date=March 25, 2014|website=Media Matters|access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref><ref name=DFP>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/214489436/ted-nugent-grows-up-the-detroit-free-press-magazine-july-15-1990|title="Ted Nugent Grows Up?" The Detroit Free Press Magazine, July 15, 1990|via=Scribd|access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref>

Nugent denied this story in a 2018 appearance on ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]'', claiming that he invented the story for his and his band's amusement, because news sources at the time often published inaccurate information about them, and that he wanted to mess with the "dirtbag" and "[[hippie]]" writers of ''High Times'' (a [[marijuana]]-themed magazine), because he was "hardcore anti-drug".<ref name=MM /><ref name=DFP /><ref name=auto3 /> He further asserted to Rogan that in 1969 he passed his draft physical "with flying colors", and denied that he was given a [[Selective Service System#Classifications|4-F]] draft classification.<ref name=auto3>{{cite web|title=Joe Rogan Experience #1138 – Ted Nugent|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yp6ZdCIE3k |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718041643/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yp6ZdCIE3k |archive-date=2018-07-18 |url-status=dead|via=YouTube|access-date=July 4, 2018|date=June 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=auto2 /><ref name=draftrecord>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/ted-nugent-draft-dodger-467132|title=Gun Enthusiast Ted Nugent Wasn't Anxious To Bear Arms Against Those Pesky Vietcong|date=February 12, 2013|website=[[The Smoking Gun]]}}</ref> 

Nugent's claims to Rogan are contradicted by his [[Selective Service]] record.<ref name=draftrecord /> According to these records, he was given [[student deferment]]s while attending [[Oakland Community College]], and upon leaving the school received a draft rating of I-A, before failing his draft physical on August 28, 1969.<ref name=auto2 /><ref name=draftrecord /> After that physical, he was rated 1-Y ("registrant qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency") until that classification was abolished in 1971.<ref name=auto2 /><ref name=draftrecord /> He was subsequently reclassified 4-F, indicating ineligibility for military service due to not meeting physical, mental, or moral standards.<ref name=auto2 /><ref name=draftrecord />

==Musical career==

Nugent's influences include [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bo Diddley]], and [[Little Richard]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=McCollum |first=Brian |title=Ted Nugent and Wayne Kramer: An unlikely friendship, forged in Detroit soul |url=https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2024/02/04/wayne-kramer-ted-nugent-friendship-detroit-music/72466031007/ |access-date=2024-05-23 |website=[[Detroit Free Press]]}}</ref>

===The Amboy Dukes===
The first lineup of [[the Amboy Dukes (band)|the Amboy Dukes]] played at [[The Cellar (teen dance club)|The Cellar]], a teen dance club outside of Chicago in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois]], starting in late 1965, while Nugent was a student at [[St. Viator High School]]. The Cellar's "house band" at the time had been [[the Shadows of Knight]], although the Amboy Dukes eventually became a staple until the club's closing.<ref>[http://www.tednugent.com/hunting/news/2008/default.aspx?PostID=539794] {{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

The Amboy Dukes' second single was "[[Journey to the Center of the Mind (song)|Journey to the Center of the Mind]]", which featured lyrics written by the Dukes' second guitarist [[Steve Farmer (musician)|Steve Farmer]] from the [[Journey to the Center of the Mind|album of the same title]] whose cover features a diverse array of drug paraphernalia. Nugent, an ardent anti-drug campaigner, has always claimed that he had no idea that this song was about drug use.<ref name="Ref-1">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nugent-idUSTRE53A00C20090411 |last=Graff |first=Gary |title=Ted Nugent reuniting Amboy Dukes for Detroit event |work=Reuters|date=April 11, 2009 |access-date=December 15, 2012}}</ref> Early albums ''[[The Amboy Dukes (album)|The Amboy Dukes]]'' (1967), ''[[Journey to the Center of the Mind (album)|Journey to the Center of the Mind]]'' (1968) and ''[[Migration (The Amboy Dukes album)|Migration]]'' (1969)—all recorded on the Mainstream label—sold moderately well. On April 5, 1968, the day after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], Nugent joined other musicians in a tribute to King by having a folk, rock and blues [[jam session]]. [[Joni Mitchell]] played first, followed by [[Buddy Guy]], [[Cactus (American band)|Cactus]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Other musicians who participated were [[B. B. King]] and [[Al Kooper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/chronology/byyear.cfm?year=1968|title=Joni Mitchell's Chronology of Appearances, 1968|publisher=Jonimitchell.com|access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref>

After settling down on a ranch in Michigan in 1973, Nugent signed a record deal with [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[DiscReet Records]] label and recorded ''[[Call of the Wild (Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes album)|Call of the Wild]]'' under the revised band name Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes. The following year, ''[[Tooth Fang & Claw]]'' (which contained the song "Great White Buffalo") established a fan base for Nugent and the other Amboy Dukes. Personnel changes at this time nearly wrecked the band. Nugent reunited with the other members of the Amboy Dukes at the 2009 Detroit Music Awards, which took place April 17, 2009. The [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] band received a distinguished achievement honor at the event. The Dukes also played together at the ceremony, marking their first public performance in more than 30 years.<ref name="Ref-1" />

===Solo career===

[[File:Ted Nugent 1979 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Nugent performing in 1979]]
Nugent dropped the Amboy Dukes band name for good in 1975 and signed to [[Epic Records]]. Retaining only bassist [[Rob Grange]] from the previous Amboy Dukes lineup, Nugent added [[Derek St. Holmes]] (guitar, vocals) and [[Clifford Davies]] (drums). This quartet remained the primary band members for Nugent's 1970s multi-platinum<ref name="TedNugentASearch">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Ted%20Nugent&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50|title=RIAA Gold and Platinum Search for albums by Ted Nugent|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref> albums: ''[[Ted Nugent (album)|Ted Nugent]]'' (1975), ''[[Free-for-All (Ted Nugent album)|Free-for-All]]'' (1976) and ''[[Cat Scratch Fever]]'' (1977). These albums produced the popular radio anthems "Hey Baby", "[[Stranglehold (Ted Nugent song)|Stranglehold]]", "Dog Eat Dog" and "[[Cat Scratch Fever (song)|Cat Scratch Fever]]". Despite most of the songwriting credits being listed as solely Nugent, St. Holmes claims that many were co-written by the whole band and that Nugent took sole credit as a way to avoid paying them royalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTb_yory7tc |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/CTb_yory7tc |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|title=Ep. 260 Derek St. Holmes, The Voice of Ted Nugent Remembers Touring with KISS in the 70s|last=Michael Brandvold|date=December 26, 2017|access-date=August 10, 2018|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

It was during these three years that Nugent emerged as a guitar hero to hard rock fans, many of whom were unaware of his lengthy apprenticeship with the Amboy Dukes.<ref>Charlesworth, Chris. ''A-Z of Rock Guitarists'', pg. 65</ref> This band lineup toured extensively, also releasing the multi-platinum live album ''[[Double Live Gonzo!]]'' (1978), until its breakup in 1978 when St. Holmes and Grange departed. St. Holmes was replaced by [[Charlie Huhn]] and Grange by multiple bassists, with Nugent eventually settling on Dave Kiswiney for a three-album stretch in the 1980s. Davies left around 1982 after staying on to record ''[[Weekend Warriors (album)|Weekend Warriors]]'' (1978), ''[[State of Shock (Ted Nugent album)|State of Shock]]'' (1979) and ''[[Scream Dream]]'' (1980), all three of which charted in the US Top 25, plus the live album ''[[Intensities in 10 Cities]]'' (1981). The ''Intensities in 10 Cities'' album includes the controversial song "Jailbait".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Womack|first1=Larry|title=Ted Nugent's Jailbait Problem|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/ted-nugents-jailbait-problem_b_4840060.html|access-date=September 13, 2015|work=HuffPost|date=April 25, 2014}}</ref>

On July 8, 1979, Ted was on the rock radio program ''[[King Biscuit Flower Hour]]''. This was the original broadcast of Ted's performance of ''[[Live at Hammersmith '79]]'' which had been recorded during the second set of a night at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in 1979. An album of this program was released in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/audio/?fa=contributor:nugent,+ted&all=true|title=Search results from Audio Recording, Nugent, Ted|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

===1980s solo career and Damn Yankees===
During the period of 1982{{ndash}}1988, Nugent released four more solo albums (to declining critical favor and commercial performance) and also began assuming a more prominent role as lead vocalist. In 1989, he joined the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]], with [[Jack Blades]] (bass/vocals, of [[Night Ranger]]), [[Tommy Shaw]] (guitar/vocals, of [[Styx (band)|Styx]]) and [[Michael Cartellone]] (drums). ''[[Damn Yankees (album)|Damn Yankees]]'' (1990) was a hit album, going double platinum in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-08-20-9203160169-story.html|title=DAMN YANKEES TO HIT THE ROAD AND NOT LET UP|author=Chris Morris|website=Chicago Tribune|date=August 20, 1992 }}</ref> thanks to the hit power ballad "[[High Enough]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/damn-yankees|title=Damn Yankees Chart History|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> The second and final Damn Yankees album, ''[[Don't Tread]]'' (1992), reached gold status in the U.S., but was not as well-received as the band's debut and the group dissolved soon after.

===Return to solo career===
{{missing information|section|the time from 2011 to 2023|date=May 2023}}
Returning to a solo career, Nugent released ''[[Spirit of the Wild]]'' in 1995, his best-reviewed album in quite some time. The album contained the bowhunting anthem "Fred Bear", and also marked the return of Derek St. Holmes to Nugent's studio band. A series of archival releases also came out in the 1990s, keeping Nugent's name in the national consciousness. He also began hosting a radio show in Detroit on [[WDKL (FM)|WWBR-FM]] ("102.7 The Bear, Detroit's Rock Animal") and took ownership in several hunting-related businesses. He created TV shows for several networks: ''[[Wanted: Ted or Alive]]'' on [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]], ''Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild'' on [[PBS]] and [[The Outdoor Channel]], and ''Surviving Nugent'' and ''[[Supergroup (TV series)|Supergroup-Damnocracy]]'' on [[VH1]]. In 2006, Nugent was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/89-ted-nugent|title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends – TED NUGENT|first=OJ|last=Advertising|website=michiganrockandrolllegends.com|access-date=August 10, 2018}}</ref>

On March 14, 2011, Nugent released a new song, "I Still Believe", as a free download via his website to subscribers to his newsletter. Nugent says of the song: "America is a target-rich environment for an independent man addicted to logic, truth and The American Way.

===Influence===
Nugent has been cited as a key influence in the [[straight edge]] movement, a [[punk rock]]-associated lifestyle that developed in the early 1980s and discourages drug and alcohol use. [[Henry Rollins]], former vocalist for [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Rollins Band]], said he and [[Ian MacKaye]], former vocalist for [[Minor Threat]] and [[Fugazi]] (and coiner of the term "straight edge" from [[Straight Edge (song)|his song of the same title]]), were inspired by Nugent during their high school years in the 1970s. Rollins has been quoted as saying, "[We] would read about the Nuge and the thing that really rubbed off on us was the fact that he didn't drink or smoke or do drugs ... [Nugent's performance] was the craziest thing we'd ever seen onstage and here's this guy saying, 'I don't get high.' We thought that was so impressive."<ref>As quoted by Michael Azerrad (2001) Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991. New York: Little, Brown and Company. {{ISBN|0-316-78753-1}}, p. 121</ref>

He has also been cited as an influence to [[Guns N’ Roses|Guns N' Roses]] guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]] bassist [[Robert DeLeo]], and [[Brother Cane]] guitarists [[Damon Johnson]] and Dave Anderson.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.al.com/life/2023/05/im-ted-nugent-music-without-the-politics-classic-rock-icon-says.html | title='I'm Ted Nugent music without the politics,' classic-rock icon Derek St. Holmes says | date=May 19, 2023 }}</ref>

Several notable artists have covered Nugent's songs, including the [[Ramones]] version of "Journey to the Center of the Mind" on their album ''[[Acid Eaters]]'', and [[Pantera]] and [[Motörhead]] versions of "Cat Scratch Fever". Nugent expressed a love for all three artists, but criticized their covers for a lack of soulfulness, calling them "just too caucasian".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/ted-nugent-says-motorhead-and-panteras-cover-versions-of-cat-scratch-fever-lack-the-groove-of-the-original | title=TED NUGENT Says MOTÖRHEAD and PANTERA's Cover Versions of 'Cat Scratch Fever' Lack the 'Groove' of the Original | date=November 14, 2022 }}</ref> On September 12, 2024, [[Pearl Jam]] covered "Stranglehold" during a live show, but with lyrics changed to be anti-gun.

==Television and movie appearances==
===Reality TV===
Nugent has starred in several [[reality shows]], including his own outdoors television show on the [[Outdoor Channel]], named after his popular song "[[Spirit of the Wild]]", since 2001. The song was the theme music to the TV series, in which Nugent took viewers on a variety of wild game hunts using his bow. In the series, he taught and advised hunters and "hands-on" conservationists around the world on the different aspects of hunting and politics.<ref>[http://www.outdoorchannel.com/Shows/TedNugent.aspx Spirit of the Wild] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513190928/http://www.outdoorchannel.com/shows/tednugent.aspx |date=May 13, 2010 }}.

Captured on film by VH1 was a rare Nugent duet with guitarist [[Joe Bonamassa]] at the [[Sand Dollar Blues Room]] for a 45-minute blues jam. He starred in another reality show for [[Country Music Television|CMT]] in August 2009. The show, titled ''Runnin' Wild ...

Also in 2001, Nugent appeared as himself in the second episode of the short-lived university campus [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] comedy series ''[[Undeclared]]''. In the episode "Full Bluntal Nugety", Nugent is a guest at the university, there to speak on his favorite topics, mainly hunting and gun control. FOX did not like the idea of Nugent and his political views appearing on this show, so the episode was re-shot and re-edited as "Oh, So You Have a Boyfriend?" which aired without any Ted Nugent content whatsoever. The complete "Full Bluntal Nugety (Director's Cut)" episode is available in its entirety in the ''[[Undeclared]]'' DVD box set, including some extra Ted Nugent scenes that had been deleted.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

At a concert on August 22, 2007, while wielding what appeared to be assault-like rifles, Nugent said in reference of Obama, "suck on my machine gun".

====Donald Trump====
[[File:Ted Nugent at White House in April 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|Nugent at the [[White House]] in April 2017]]
In February 2016, Ted Nugent praised Trump's [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 Republican Presidential Primary]] opponent [[Ted Cruz]], stating "My dream would be if Ted Cruz became president tonight. I really admire Ted Cruz, on many levels."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/ted-nugent-obama-biggest-racist-america|title=Ted Nugent: Obama 'Is The Biggest Racist in America' – Right Wing Watch|website=Rightwingwatch.org|date=September 12, 2016}}</ref> Nugent later [[List of Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign endorsements|endorsed Donald Trump]] and during the last week of the [[2016 United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election campaign]] performed at a number of Trump rallies in Michigan, including Trump's final campaign rally in [[Grand Rapids]].

On April 19, 2017, alongside [[Kid Rock]] and [[Sarah Palin]], Nugent had a "long-planned" visit at the White House. According to Nugent, the visit lasted four hours and was like "a family reunion." Nugent described it as "a wonderful personal tour of every room" followed by photo sessions and dinner with Trump.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thrush|first=Glenn|date=April 20, 2017|title=4 Hours at the White House With Ted Nugent, Sarah Palin and Kid Rock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/us/politics/sarah-palin-kid-rock-ted-nugent-white-house.html|website=The New York Times|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref>

===Potential runs for office===
Referring to Michigan governor [[Jennifer Granholm]] (in office 2003–2011), during performances he would frequently interject "Jennifer Granholm, kiss my ass" into his songs and shoot an arrow at her likeness. In a 2007 interview, in discussing running for governor of Michigan, he stated that Granholm "is not doing an ugly job, but as the perfect woman, she is scrotumless".<ref>{{cite web|title=TED NUGENT To Run For Michigan Governor In 2010?|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=46511|website=Blabbermouth.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213234743/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=46511 |date=January 7, 2006 |archive-date=December 13, 2011}}</ref>

Although Nugent has never run for government office, in the 2000s, he publicly speculated about doing so on several occasions. In May 2005, he announced he was "getting real close to deciding to run" for [[governor of Michigan]] in 2006; while in 2007, he talked about running for that office in 2010. During the latter period, he stated, "Michigan was once a great state. Michigan was a state that rewarded the entrepreneur and the most productive, work-ethic families of the state. Now the pimps and the whores and the welfare brats are basically the state's babies."<ref name="Tanner, Adam 2007" /> Earlier, Nugent had been rumored to be under consideration by the [[Illinois Republican Party]] as its candidate in that state's 2004 Senate race, given his roots in Illinois.<ref name="auto1" />

In July 2008, Nugent declared "I was serious when I threatened to run for office in the past if I cannot find a candidate who respects the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and our sacred [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]."<ref name="Des"/> When asked by ''Imagineer'' magazine in a 2010 interview about what he would do if elected to political office, he responded: "Slash the living hell out of the waste and corruption and the outrageous army of do-nothing bureaucrats. I would fire every government worker whose job I would deem to be redundant and wasteful. No able-bodied human being would ever get a handout again."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ted Nugent on what he would if elected to public office|url=http://www.imagineermagazine.com/index.php/issue_archives/spring_2010/ted_nugent|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713015707/http://www.imagineermagazine.com/index.php/issue_archives/spring_2010/ted_nugent|url-status=usurped|archive-date=July 13, 2011|website=Imagineer Magazine|access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref>
