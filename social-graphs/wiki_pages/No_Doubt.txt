'''No Doubt''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Anaheim, California]] in 1986. For most of its career, the band has consisted of vocalist and founding member [[Gwen Stefani]], guitarist [[Tom Dumont]], bassist [[Tony Kanal]] and drummer [[Adrian Young]]. Keyboardist [[Eric Stefani]], Gwen's brother, was also a member when the band started to release albums in 1992. Since the mid-1990s, trombonist [[Gabrial McNair]] and trumpeter Stephen Bradley have performed with the band as session and touring musicians.

The band's [[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|1992 eponymous debut album]] failed to make an impact. Its [[ska punk]]-inspired follow-up ''[[The Beacon Street Collection]]'' sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, more than triple the sales of its predecessor. Their third album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]''  was released later the same year and benefited from the 1990s resurgence of [[third-wave ska]], going on to achieve [[RIAA certification|diamond certification]]. "[[Don't Speak]]", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart, while "[[Just a Girl]]", co-written by Stefani, was described as "the most popular cut on the CD".<ref name="orangeCoast">{{Cite news|last=Christian Goulding|first=Susan|date=June 1996|title=An Uncommon Angst: In the shadow of the Matterhorn, No Doubt composed ''Tragic Kingdom''|page=24|work=[[Orange Coast (magazine)|Orange Coast Magazine]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4v0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24|issn=0279-0483}}</ref>

The band's next album, ''[[Return of Saturn]]'' (2000), did not match the success of their previous album, despite its Top 40 hit single "[[Simple Kind of Life]]". However, the album received critical praise and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] at the [[2001 Grammy Awards|43rd Grammy Awards]]. The following year, the band returned with the album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001), which incorporated [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] music. The album was primarily recorded in [[Jamaica]] and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists [[Bounty Killer]], [[Sly and Robbie]] and [[Lady Saw]]. The album produced two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning singles, "[[Hey Baby (No Doubt song)|Hey Baby]]" and "[[Underneath It All]]"; "[[Hella Good]]" was also nominated for a Grammy award.

After a 2004 tour, the band members pursued solo projects, with Stefani releasing two successful solo albums ''[[Love. Angel. Music. Baby.]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Sweet Escape]]'' (2006), while Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, [[Invincible Overlord]]. In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth and latest effort, titled ''[[Push and Shove (album)|Push and Shove]]'' (2012), and released its lead single "[[Settle Down (No Doubt song)|Settle Down]]". The band has sold over 33 million records worldwide.

==History==

===1986–1989: Formation, early years and line-up changes ===
In 1986, [[Eric Stefani]] and John Spence met at a [[Dairy Queen]] and talked about getting a group together to play music. Stefani acquired a keyboard and gathered some players together to practice; these included himself (keyboards), his sister [[Gwen Stefani]] (backing vocals), John Spence (lead vocals), Jerry McMahon (guitar), Chris Leal (bass), Chris Webb (drums), Gabriel Gonzalez (trumpet), [[Starpool|Alan Meade]] (trumpet), and Tony Meade (saxophone). They practiced in Eric's parents' garage.<ref name="orangeCoast" />

[[Tony Kanal]] went to one of the band's early shows, and soon joined the band as its bassist. After initially rejecting her advances, he began dating Gwen, but they kept their relationship secret for a year, feeling that it was an unspoken rule that no one in the band date her.<ref name="btm">"No Doubt". ''[[Behind the Music]]''. [[VH1]]. April 9, 2000.</ref> Paul Caseley (trombone) also joined the band in 1987. Eric Carpenter (saxophone) joined the horn section soon after.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carpenter|first=Eric|date=November 30, 2012|title=No Regrets, No Doubt|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2012/11/30/no-regrets-no-doubt/|access-date=August 6, 2020|website=[[Orange County Register]]|language=en-US}}</ref> The group performed at an Orange High School backyard graduation party on June 6, 1987, with two other California ska bands. At the party, No Doubt's set included "Total Hate", "Too Much Pressure", "Danger", "Paulina", "Gangsters", and the song "No Doubt". Video clips from the party appeared on VH1's ''[[Behind the Music]]''.

===1990–1992: Self-titled debut album ===
{{Main|No Doubt (No Doubt album)}}
Impressed by the presence of [[stage diving]] fans at No Doubt's concerts and Gwen's on-stage presence, Tony Ferguson signed the band to a multi-album deal with the newly created [[Interscope Records]] in 1990.<ref name="btm"/> No Doubt's [[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in 1992, but it featured no radio singles, although a video was made for "Trapped in a Box".

===1993–1997: Reorganization and career breakthrough ===
{{Main|The Beacon Street Collection|Tragic Kingdom}}
The band began work on its next album the next year, but Interscope rejected much of its material, and the band was paired with producer [[Matthew Wilder]]. Eric did not like to relinquish creative control to someone outside the band and eventually stopped recording and rehearsing. He left No Doubt in 1994 to resume an animation career with the [[cartoon]] [[TV series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref name="btm"/> Kanal then ended his seven-year relationship with Gwen, saying that he needed "space".<ref>''Born to Be''.

The release of 1995's ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'' and the single "[[Just a Girl]]" allowed the group to achieve mainstream commercial success.

===1998–2003: Continued touring and new albums ===
{{Main|Return of Saturn|Rock Steady (album)}}
[[File:NoDoubtRockSteadyTour.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|No Doubt performing in 2002]]
The band finished its tour in December 1997 and had several releases during the two-year writing process to make its follow-up to ''Tragic Kingdom''.<ref name="btm"/> ''[[Live in the Tragic Kingdom]]'', a live long-form video of the band's performance at the [[Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim]], was released and ''The Beacon Street Collection'' was re-released while the band was on tour that year. The band recorded "I Throw My Toys Around" with [[Elvis Costello]] for ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'', and it contributed to [[The Clash]]'s tribute album ''[[Burning London: The Clash Tribute]]''. Stefani began to make recordings without the band, contributing vocals to tracks for [[The Brian Setzer Orchestra]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Fishbone]], and Familyhood Nextperience, and her boyfriend [[Gavin Rossdale]]'s band [[Bush (British band)|Bush]]. After some time in-between albums, No Doubt included its song "[[New (No Doubt song)|New]]" on the [[soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[Go (1999 film)|Go]]'' in 1999. "New", inspired by Gwen's budding relationship with Rossdale, was one of the first songs written after the release of ''Tragic Kingdom''.

In 2000, the band released ''[[Return of Saturn]]'', its follow-up to ''Tragic Kingdom''. The album featured a darker tone and was more lyrically advanced than No Doubt's previous work.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|date=May 12, 2000|title=Return of Saturn – No Doubt|url={{AllMusic|id=mw0000057560|type=album|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=December 30, 2006|website=AllMusic}}</ref> The main lyrical focus of the new record had shifted from Gwen Stefani's relationship with bassist Tony Kanal to her new relationship with Gavin Rossdale.<ref name=":3" /> ''Return of Saturn'' was critically acclaimed, but was not as commercially successful as their previous album, and the lead single, "[[Ex-Girlfriend (song)|Ex-Girlfriend]]", failed to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States. Also released as singles from the album were the tracks "[[Simple Kind of Life]]" and "[[Bathwater (song)|Bathwater]]". Lukewarm sales drastically shortened the tour that followed, appearing only in festival settings in L.A., Cincinnati, Nashville, Jacksonville and Miami. On August 10, No Doubt went on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]'' and performed a few of their songs, and were joined by friend [[Alain Johannes]] (of [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]]) and former member Eric Stefani.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|title=Timeline {{!}} Journal|url=http://www.nodoubt.com/band/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223124634/http://www.nodoubt.com/band/|archive-date=February 23, 2009|access-date=October 31, 2011|website=No Doubt official website}}</ref>

After ''Return of Saturn'', the band returned to recording in January 2001. During this time, it contributed a cover version of [[Donna Summer]]'s "[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]" for the ''[[Zoolander]]'' soundtrack and recorded a song with [[Kelis]] for her album ''[[Wanderland]]''. Stefani made high-profile appearances on [[Moby]]'s "[[South Side (song)|South Side]]" and [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve's]] "[[Let Me Blow Ya Mind]]". These appearances lent No Doubt credibility and an opportunity to explore new genres.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Thomas Erlewine|first=Stephen|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Rock Steady – No Doubt|url={{AllMusic|id=mw0000229552|type=album|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=August 31, 2007|website=AllMusic}}</ref> Highly influenced by [[Jamaica]]n [[dancehall]] music and recorded primarily in Jamaica, the band's 2001 studio album, ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'', produced two hit [[Grammy]]-winning singles, "[[Hey Baby (No Doubt song)|Hey Baby]]", which featured [[Bounty Killer]], and "[[Underneath It All]]", which featured "the first lady of dancehall", [[Lady Saw]]. Both singles managed to reach the top five on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also released "[[Hella Good]]" and "[[Running (No Doubt song)|Running]]" as singles. In addition, pop-star Prince co-wrote, produced, and performed on "Waiting Room" from ''Rock Steady''. Stefani had previously provided vocals for a song on Prince's ''[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]'' album, "So Far, So Pleased". In November 2002, No Doubt made an appearance in the ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' episode "Spiderwebs".<ref>{{cite web|title=Dawson's Creek – Spiderwebs|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/dawsons-creek/show/spiderwebs/episode/10146|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306012807/http://tv.yahoo.com/dawsons-creek/show/spiderwebs/episode/10146|archive-date=March 6, 2012|access-date=January 18, 2017|website=[[Yahoo!

I was really drained and burned out when we recorded [2012's ''Push and Shove'']. And I had a lot of guilt: 'I have to do it.' That's not the right setting to make music.

The band's debut album blended the ska punk, alternative rock and new wave genres.

==''Band Hero'' lawsuit==
On November 4, 2009, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that No Doubt had filed a lawsuit over its portrayal in the music video game ''[[Band Hero]]''. The lawsuit alleged that the game had "transformed No Doubt band members into a virtual karaoke circus act", singing dozens of songs the group neither wrote, popularized, nor approved for use in the game. The case was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and cited [[Activision]], the game's distributor, as having exceeded contractual likenesses of the members of No Doubt.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/11/no-doubt-sues-activision-over-band-hero.html |title=No Doubt sues Activision over Band Hero |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 4, 2009 |access-date=January 1, 2010}}</ref>

On February 15, 2011, the [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District]] affirmed the trial court's denial of Activision's special motion to strike No Doubt's lawsuit as a [[strategic lawsuit against public participation]], after an [[interlocutory appeal]] by Activision.<ref>{{Cite court|litigants=No Doubt v. Activision Publishing, Inc.|court=|reporter=Cal. App. 4th|vol=192|opinion=1018|date=February 15, 2011|url=http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/192CA4t1018.htm }}</ref> The [[appellate court]] explained that the dispute arose from No Doubt's discovery, two weeks before ''Band Hero'' went on sale, that its band members could be manipulated in the game to perform songs they would never perform in real life. The court then explained: "The band also learned that female lead singer Gwen Stefani's avatar could be made to sing in a male voice, and the male band members' avatars could be manipulated to sing songs in female voices. The individual band member avatars could be made to perform solo, without their band members, as well as with members of other groups." The court then ruled that Activision's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] defense was meritless, No Doubt had a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits, and that No Doubt was entitled to recover costs and attorney's fees incurred in opposing Activision's appeal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

In 2012, the issue was settled out of court, two weeks before scheduled trial date.<ref>{{Cite news|date=October 5, 2012|title=No Doubt settle dispute over Band Hero music game|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19841488|access-date=October 2, 2021}}</ref>
