'''The Guess Who''' is a [[Rock music of Canada|Canadian rock band]] formed in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], in 1965. The band found their greatest success in the late 1960s and early 1970s under the leadership of singer and keyboardist [[Burton Cummings]] and guitarist [[Randy Bachman]], with hit songs including "[[American Woman]]", "[[These Eyes]]", "[[No Time (Guess Who song)|No Time]]", "[[Laughing (The Guess Who song)|Laughing]]" and "[[Share the Land (song)|Share the Land]]".

During their most successful period, the Guess Who released eleven studio albums, all of which reached the charts in Canada and the United States. Their 1970 album ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'' reached number 1 in Canada and the United States, while five other albums reached the top ten in Canada. The Guess Who charted fourteen Top-40 singles in the United States, and more than thirty in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Guess Who {{!}} Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-guess-who-mn0000061480|access-date=February 27, 2021|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref>

The Guess Who officially broke up in 1975, with a major reunion tour in the early 2000s.

==History==
===Predecessor groups (1958–1965)===
In 1958, Winnipeg singer and guitarist [[Chad Allan (musician)|Chad Allan]] formed a local rock band called Al and the Silvertones.<ref>{{cite web|title= Chad Allan, founding member of Guess Who and the band that became BTO, dies at 80|date=December 4, 2023|publisher=St. Albert Gazette|url=https://www.stalbertgazette.com/lifestyle-news/chad-allan-founding-member-of-guess-who-and-the-band-that-became-bto-dies-at-80-7916196|first=David|last=Friend|access-date=December 18, 2023}}</ref><ref name=Hoffmann2005>{{cite book|editor-last=Hoffmann|editor-first=Frank|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|edition=2|volume=1 (A-L)|pages=992–993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=2005|isbn=0-415-93835-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GGTAgAAQBAJ&q=Silvertones}}</ref> After several lineup changes, the band stabilized in 1962 under the name '''Chad Allan and the Reflections''', which included Allan and keyboardist Bob Ashley, plus future Guess Who mainstays [[Randy Bachman]] on guitar, [[Jim Kale]] on bass, and [[Garry Peterson]] on drums.<ref name=Hoffmann2005/>

Chad Allan and the Reflections released their first single, "[[Tribute to Buddy Holly#Chad Allan and the Reflections version|Tribute To Buddy Holly]]", on Canadian-American Records in 1962.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&q=%22Tribute+to+Buddy+Holly%22+%22guess+who%22&pg=PA1567|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music|date=May 27, 2011|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-595-8|pages=1567}}</ref>{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=433}} They then signed with Quality Records and released several singles in 1963–64, which gained some regional notice around Winnipeg but made little impact in the rest of Canada. One single was credited, perhaps mistakenly, to Bob Ashley and the Reflections.<ref name=WFP2015>{{cite web|last=Einarson|first=John|title=The long lost Who|work=Winnipeg Free Press|date=August 9, 2015|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/2015/08/09/the-long-lost-who|access-date=June 15, 2025}}</ref>

After an American group called [[The Reflections (Detroit band)|the Reflections]] released the 1964 hit single "[[(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet]]", the group changed its name to '''Chad Allan and the Expressions'''. Under this new name, they released the [[garage rock]] album ''[[Shakin' All Over (album)|Shakin' All Over]]'' in January 1965.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=style|id=garage-rock-ma0000004458|tab=albums|label=Garage Rock Album Highlights}}</ref> That album's single, "[[Shakin' All Over]]", earlier recorded by [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates]], was the band's first major hit, reaching no. 1 in Canada, no. 22 in the United States, and no. 27 in Australia. Their Canadian label, Quality Records, disguised the single by crediting it to '''Guess Who?''', as a publicity stunt to generate speculation that it was by a more famous [[British Invasion]] band working incognito.{{sfn|Lawson|2020|pp=6-7}}

After Quality Records revealed the band to be Chad Allan and the Expressions, disc jockeys continued to announce the group as Guess Who?, effectively forcing the band to accept the new name. They released their second album, ''[[Hey Ho (What You Do to Me!)]]'' in late 1965; it was credited to Chad Allan and the Expressions with "Guess Who?" displayed prominently on the cover.{{sfn|Einarson|1995|pp=35-39}}

===Early years (1965–1968)===
Keyboardist Bob Ashley left the band in January 1966 because of the rigors of touring.{{sfn|Einarson|1995|pp=35-39}} He was replaced by 18-year-old [[Burton Cummings]] (formerly of Winnipeg group the Deverons) who also took on lead vocal duties in conjunction with Chad Allan on the band's first album, released under the band name the Guess Who? (The question mark would be dropped later.) Just a few months later, Allan departed; he returned to college and then became a media personality with the [[CBC Music|CBC]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Canadian Bands.com – Chad Allan & The Expressions|url=http://www.canadianbands.com/Chad%20Allan.html|access-date=February 27, 2021|website=canadianbands.com|archive-date=October 19, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211019142307/http://www.canadianbands.com/Chad%20Allan.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> This left Cummings as the sole lead singer.<ref name="Metzer2008">{{cite book|first=Greg|last=Metzer|title=Rock Band Name Origins: The Stories of 240 Groups and Performers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Is57BwAAQBAJ&pg=PA93|date=May 21, 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3818-1|pages=93–}}</ref> After Allan's departure in 1966, guitarist Bruce Decker, a former bandmate of Cummings in the Deverons, joined for a few months.{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=433}}

The Guess Who released its first album, ''[[It's Time (The Guess Who album)|It's Time]]'', with Cummings on vocals and keyboards, Bachman on guitar, Kale on bass, and Peterson on drums,{{sfn|Einarson|1995|pp=35-39}} in the summer of 1966.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=shakin-all-over-hey-ho-its-time-mw0000318376|label=''Shakin' All Over/Hey Ho/It's Time''|access-date=September 01, 2015}}</ref> Decker, despite being pictured on the cover of the album, did not participate in the recording. Conversely, some contributions by Allan (recorded before he left the group) can be heard on the album,{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} though he is not credited or pictured on the album cover. Many of the songs were written by Randy Bachman.

The Guess Who continued to release singles that were moderately successful in Canada, and "[[His Girl]]" entered the UK charts in 1967.<ref>[http://musicvf.com/song.php?title=His+Girl+by+The+Guess+Who&id=72794 The Guess Who, "His Girl" United Kingdom Chart Position] Retrieved March 9, 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.10048&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=98q6tcgku7546lsrfi3gr83pp7 The Guess Who, "His Girl" Canadian Chart Position] Retrieved March 9, 2015</ref> The band travelled to the United Kingdom to promote the single, but this was a financial mistake as the song quickly dropped off the charts.

After seeing the Guess Who on ''Let's Go'', record producer and sales executive [[Jack Richardson (record producer)|Jack Richardson]] contacted the band about participating in an advertising project for [[Coca-Cola]]. This project became a split album titled ''A Wild Pair'' with [[Ottawa]] band the Staccatos (themselves soon to renamed [[Five Man Electrical Band]]). The album could be purchased only by mail-order from Coca-Cola.<ref name=Edwardson2009/> Richardson served as the Guess Who's producer until the band's breakup in 1975,<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Guess Who {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-guess-who-mn0000061480/biography|access-date=February 27, 2021|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> and they were managed during that entire period by Don Hunter.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwkEAAAAMBAJ&q=the+guess+who&pg=RA1-PA31|title=Winnipeg's Don Hunter|magazine=Billboard|date=September 29, 1973|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref>

==="American Woman" era (1968–1970)===
Richardson signed the Guess Who to his Nimbus 9 label and production company, and personally financed the recording of a new album in late 1968. The band was also signed to [[RCA Records|RCA]] for distribution outside of Canada.

===Continued success (1970–1974)===
While ''American Woman'' became a success in the early months of 1970, Bachman recorded an all-instrumental solo album titled ''Axe'' with Peterson on drums.{{sfn|Einarson|1995|pp=35-39}}<ref>{{Citation|title=Axe – Randy Bachman {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/axe-mw0000746987|access-date=February 27, 2021}}</ref> The Guess Who began recording a follow-up to ''American Woman'', completing seven tracks (which were withheld and not released until 1976 under the title ''The Way They Were''.)<ref>{{Citation|title=The Way They Were – The Guess Who {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-way-they-were-mw0000462495|access-date=February 27, 2021}}</ref>

Bachman took a break from touring with the Guess Who due to illness, with American guitarist Bobby Sabellico filling in temporarily. Bachman played a final show with the band and exited the band in May 1970; his relations with Cummings had deteriorated and his recent conversion to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|Mormonism]] caused dissatisfaction with the band's rock 'n' roll lifestyle.{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=433}} Bachman later formed the successful hard-rock band [[Bachman–Turner Overdrive|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bachman-Turner Overdrive {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bachman-turner-overdrive-mn0000062002/biography|access-date=February 27, 2021|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref>

Additionally, he said the White House never asked them to drop the song.

The expanded lineup quickly recorded the album ''[[Share the Land]]'', which was released in late 1970 and became another substantial hit in both Canada and the United States.

Just two months after McDougall joined the Guess Who in 1972, founding bassist [[Jim Kale]] was dismissed from the band; he then joined Vancouver band [[Scrubbaloe Caine]] who released one album and achieved some Canadian hit singles in the mid-1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Scrubbaloe Caine {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/scrubbaloe-caine-mn0001341301|access-date=February 27, 2021|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> Kale subsequently formed and played with the Jim Kale Band, followed by the Ripple Brothers,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.vancemasters.ca/gallery_jkale.pdf| title=Change in personnel keeps bands fresh| first= Silvio| last= Dobri|website=The Tribune|date=May 19, 1977|access-date=January 15, 2024}}</ref> before falling on hard times later in the decade.{{sfn|Einarson|1995|p=192}} The Guess Who replaced Kale with Bill Wallace, who had played with Kurt Winter in their early Winnipeg band [[Brother (Canadian band)|Brother]].{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=433}} This lineup released the albums ''[[Artificial Paradise (The Guess Who album)|Artificial Paradise]]'' in early 1973, ''[[No. 10 (The Guess Who album)|#10]]'' in late 1973 (the title of which represented their number of original albums up to that point),<ref>{{Citation|title=#10 – The Guess Who {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/10-mw0000846052|access-date=February 27, 2021}}</ref> and ''[[Road Food]]'' in early 1974.<ref name=":3">{{Citation|title=Road Food – The Guess Who {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/road-food-mw0000838595|access-date=February 27, 2021}}</ref> ''Road Food'' included the single "[[Clap for the Wolfman]]", which was a hit in both Canada and the United States, and the band's first top ten American single since 1970.<ref>''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 5th edition, 1992, page 206.</ref> The novelty song was a tribute to disc jockey [[Wolfman Jack]], who lent his voice to the recording.

===Breakup of the Guess Who (1974–1975)===
For undisclosed reasons, guitarists Winter and McDougall were dismissed from the band in June 1974.<ref name=Talevski2010/> They were replaced by a single guitarist, [[Domenic Troiano]], who had founded the successful Canadian band [[Bush (Canadian band)|Bush]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Canadian Bands.com – Bush|url=http://www.canadianbands.com/Bush.html|access-date=February 27, 2021|website=canadianbands.com}}</ref> and had also served briefly with [[James Gang]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=James Gang {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-gang-mn0000085776/biography|access-date=February 27, 2021|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> Having grown up in [[Toronto]], Troiano was the first member of The Guess Who not to hail from Winnipeg.

===The Guess Who members after 1975 breakup===
Following his departure from the Guess Who in 1970, Bachman went on to form [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]], which has continued into the 2020s.<ref>{{cite web|date=September 15, 2023| access-date=January 15, 2024|title= Bachman-Turner Overdrive Reunite, Set to Tour U.S. Fall 2023|url=https://americansongwriter.com/bachman-turner-overdrive-reunite-set-to-tour-u-s-fall-2023/|publisher=American Songwriter|first= Tina|last= Benitez-Eves}}</ref> Cummings embarked on a lengthy solo career.<ref>{{AllMusic| id= burton-cummings-mn0000942580| title= Burton Cummings}}</ref> Meanwhile, other original members drifted into relative obscurity.

In 1976, Peterson linked up with Toronto singer and ex-Domenic Troiano associate Roy Kenner and Sabellico in an R&B band, Delphia, which went unsigned and left no recordings.<ref>{{AllMusic| id= roy-kenner-mn0001516134| title= Roy Kenner}}</ref> Peterson then worked as a night clerk in his father-in-law's hotel{{sfn|Einarson|1995|p=191}} and an insurance salesman to make ends meet before eventually making his way back to music. He played drums in the backup band accompanying Cummings from 1979 through 1983,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Change of Tempo: Musician Redefines Life of a Rock Star|publisher=Greensboro News & Record|first=Leigh|last=Pressley|url=https://greensboro.com/change-of-tempo-musician-redefines-life-of-a-rock-star/article_7c6ed605-8de8-5d18-9207-456a1fa6d12c.html|date=October 6, 1995|access-date=January 15, 2024}}</ref> followed by Bachman's reunited BTO from 1984 through 1986.

After being kicked out of the Guess Who in 1972, Kale joined Vancouver band Scrubbaloe Caine until 1974. He subsequently formed the Jim Kale Band followed by the Ripple Brothers.
 
Troiano resumed his solo career, releasing three more solo albums by 1979 before forming a band called Black Market.<ref>{{AllMusic| id= domenic-troiano-mn0000175101| title= Domenic Troiano}}</ref> Wallace joined several local musicians, including Leskiw, to form Crowcuss.<ref>{{AllMusic| id= crowcuss-mn0001612842| title= Crocus's}}</ref> Kurt Winter eventually retired from the music industry and died in 1997 at age 51.<ref name=WFP2013>{{cite web|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Winter's Tale|work=Winnipeg Free Press|date=December 15, 2013|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/2013/12/15/winters-tale|access-date=June 15, 2025}}</ref>

===Classic lineup reunions===
Members of the classic-era Guess Who reunited a number of times over the years, the first being when Cummings, Bachman, Peterson, and late-classic-era bassist Wallace reformed for a CBC television special in November 1979.<ref>{{Cite news|title=That time they closed Portage and Main to pedestrians {{!}} CBC Archives|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/that-time-they-closed-portage-and-main-to-pedestrians-1.4852297|access-date=February 27, 2021}}</ref> This was followed by a short tour of notable Canadian cultural venues in 1983,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Guess Who – 1983 – Reunion soundboard@320|url=https://www.guitars101.com/threads/guess-who-1983-reunion-soundboard-320.108239/|access-date=February 27, 2021|website=Guitars101 – Guitar Forums}}</ref> resulting in the live album ''Together Again!''

===Dispute over the "Guess Who" name===
A separate band, also called the Guess Who, was formed by former bassist Jim Kale in 1978. Kale, who was fired from the band in 1972, asked Cummings for permission to use the Guess Who name for a single reunion concert,<ref name=divide/><ref name=young/> but Kale went beyond the scope of Cummings's initial permission and hired other musicians to perform as the new the Guess Who.<ref name=WFP2012/> {{citation needed|date=June 2025}}

In 1987, Kale discovered that the name the Guess Who had never been trademarked, and filed registration applications with the United States trademark office for the band name the Guess Who,<ref name="em">{{Cite magazine|last=Millman|first=Ethan|date=October 30, 2023|title='Fake Bullshit Shows': Guess Who Co-Founders Sue Ex-Bandmates|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-guess-who-founders-sue-band-false-advertising-trademark-1234863424/|access-date=December 26, 2023|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> unbeknownst to the other original members. Kale used his newly registered mark to start a new band in the United States, hiring a variety of musicians whom he called the "Guess Who".<ref name="divide">{{Cite web|date=January 20, 2016|title=Great Guess Who divide embodies one of rock's oldest dilemmas|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/mike-weatherford/great-guess-who-divide-embodies-one-of-rocks-oldest-dilemmas/|access-date=January 16, 2021}}</ref><ref name="young">{{Cite web|last=Bream|first=Jon|title=Randy Bachman discusses The Guess Who, his old pal Neil Young|url=https://www.telegram.com/entertainmentlife/20190120/randy-bachman-discusses-guess-who-his-old-pal-neil-young|access-date=January 16, 2021|website=telegram.com}}</ref> Kale temporarily retired on several occasions, leaving no original members in the band. From 2006 to 2024, the U.S. trademark for live performances using the name "The Guess Who" was owned by a partnership between Kale and drummer Garry Peterson.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Guess Who |url=https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73602644&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch |access-date=January 17, 2024 |website=uspto.gov}}</ref>

After his final retirement, Kale continued to hire musicians with no historic connection to the band,<ref name="WFP2012" /> whom he allowed to use the name as a Guess Who nostalgia band. Albums from Kale's version of the Guess Who were not released through a major label, did not chart and received mostly unfavorable reviews. Drummer Garry Peterson sometimes appeared in Kale's Guess Who lineup, though the band also performed as a cover band without any original members present.<ref>{{cite web|title=-Garry Peterson on the new The Guess Who album|publisher=The Maine Edge|url=https://www.themaineedge.com/buzz/music/garry-peterson-on-new-the-guess-who-album-the-future-is-what-it-used-to-be|access-date=October 10, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Millman">{{cite magazine|title=Classic Rockers the Guess Who Sue Ex-Members for False Advertising|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=Ethan|last=Millman|date=October 30, 2023|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-guess-who-founders-sue-band-false-advertising-trademark-1234863424/}}</ref>

Both Cummings and Bachman were highly critical of the Kale/Peterson version of the Guess Who, calling it "the fake Guess Who", or "Kale's Klones" and calling the band's concerts "fake bullshit shows".<ref name="em" /> Kale referred to his own potential iteration of the group as "a band of trained monkeys".<ref name="Millman" /> The dispute was compared to [[John Fogerty]]'s dispute with his former bandmates over the use of the name [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]].<ref name="WFP2012" /> Bachman and Cummings have toured and recorded together under the name "Bachman-Cummings".<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite magazine|title=Randy Bachman, Burton Cummings Detail First U.S. Tour in 10 Years|date=March 9, 2020|magazine=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/randy-bachman-burton-cummings-guess-who-bachman-turner-overdrive-tour-dates-963758/|access-date=March 23, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings are Back Together for 2020 Tour|magazine=Billboard|url=https://www.billboard.com/pro/randy-bachman-burton-cummings-are-back-together-tour/|access-date=October 10, 2021}}</ref>

Early in 2023, Bachman and Cummings sent multiple [[cease-and-desist]] letters to the Peterson-led nostalgia band, accusing them of misleading the public.<ref name="Millman" /> In October 2023, after having received no response to the letters, Bachman and Cummings launched a "false advertising" lawsuit against Kale and Peterson, claiming that the band has used the Guess Who name, photos of Bachman and Cummings, and original recordings, "to give the false impression that Plaintiffs are performing as part of the cover band".<ref name="Millman" /> Bachman and Cummings sought $20 million in damages.<ref name="Millman" /> A hearing pertaining to the lawsuit and Kale's and Peterson's counterclaims was scheduled for January 2024.<ref>{{cite news|title=Guess Who members seek to dismiss lawsuit from Cummings and Bachman|publisher=MSN|agency=The Canadian Press|date=December 22, 2023|url=https://www.msn.com/en-ca/entertainment/other/guess-who-members-seek-to-dismiss-lawsuit-from-cummings-and-bachman/ar-AA1lKJ8I|access-date=December 29, 2023}}</ref> In April 2024, a federal judge denied Kale and Peterson's motion to dismiss the Bachman and Cummings suit.<ref name="nuclear">{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/the-guess-who-burton-cummings-lawsuit-band-1235001408/| title=The Battle over Classic Rock Band the Guess Who Just Went Nuclear| magazine=Rolling Stone|date=April 11, 2024}}</ref>

In April 2024, Cummings arranged to have legal permission pulled for any public performance of any Guess Who material Cummings had written or co-written. This legal gambit left both the performer and the owner of the performance venue liable for damages if any Cummings-authored Guess Who songs were performed for an audience. Following this action, the cover band was unable to perform most of the group's biggest hits, including "These Eyes", "American Woman", "No Time", "Share The Land", and many others. The group's concerts were immediately canceled and the website for Peterson's Guess Who band was shuttered in July 2024.<ref name="nuclear" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Burton Cummings Gives Up Guess Who Royalties to Prevent Fake Band from Playing Their Songs|work=Exclaim!|first=Megan|last=Lapierre|date=April 11, 2024|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/burton-cummings-gives-up-guess-who-royalties-to-prevent-fake-band-from-playing-their-songs|access-date=April 15, 2024}}</ref>

In September 2024, Bachman and Cummings announced that they had gained control of the Guess Who name in an out-of-court settlement.<ref name="Millman2024"/>

===Return of the Guess Who under Bachman and Cummings' leadership (2025-present)===
In June 2025, Bachman and Cummings announced they would perform as The Guess Who at several shows in 2026. It is not yet known, as of August 2025, if any other original or classic members will rejoin the band.
