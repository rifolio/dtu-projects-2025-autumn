'''Christopher John Davison''' (born 15 October 1948), known professionally as '''Chris de Burgh''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|d|ə|_|'|b|ɜːr|}} {{respell|də|BER}}), is a British-Irish<!--please do not change this without a talk page comment. The "Early life" section mentions that his father is British and his mother is Irish. The lead section is meant to summarise the article.--> singer-songwriter and musician. He started out as an [[art rock]] performer but subsequently started writing more pop-oriented material. He has had several top 40 hit singles in the UK and two in the US, but he is more popular in other countries, particularly Norway and Brazil.<ref name="erlewine"/> His 1986 love song "[[The Lady in Red (Chris de Burgh song)|The Lady in Red]]" reached number one in several countries. De Burgh has sold over 45 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/7999802.stm | title= Chris de Burgh is singing loud | work=BBC News | date=15 April 2009 | access-date=10 August 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
De Burgh was born in [[Venado Tuerto]], Argentina, to Colonel Charles John Davison,<ref>Burke's Irish Family Records, 1976, p. 342</ref> a British diplomat, and Maeve Emily (née de Burgh). His maternal grandfather was [[Eric de Burgh|Sir Eric de Burgh]], a [[British Army]] officer who had been [[Chief of the General Staff (India)|Chief of the General Staff in India]] during the Second World War.<ref name=travelmania>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20131215233219/http://www.travelmania-ireland.com/place.php?id=1027 Bargy Castle, Co. Wexford]}}, Travelmania Ireland</ref> He took his mother's maiden name, "[[House of Burgh|de Burgh]]", as a stage name when he began performing, while his legal surname remains "Davison".<ref>{{cite book|author=Dave Wilson|title=Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to how Band Names Were Formed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOpB23GGxAIC&pg=PA167|year=2004|publisher=Cidermill Books|isbn=978-0-9748483-5-8|page=167}}</ref> His father had substantial farming interests, and Chris spent much of his early years in Malta, Nigeria and the [[Belgian Congo]], as he, his mother and brother accompanied Colonel Davison on his diplomatic and engineering work.

The Davisons finally settled in [[Bargy Castle]], [[County Wexford]], Ireland, which was somewhat dilapidated at the time. It was a twelfth-century castle which Eric de Burgh bought in the 1960s. He converted it into a hotel, and young Chris sang for the guests there.<ref name=travelmania/>

De Burgh attended [[Marlborough College]] in [[Wiltshire]], England, where he was in the year below [[Nick Drake]]; de Burgh asked to join a jazz band Drake had formed with four schoolmates, the Perfumed Gardeners, but was rejected as his taste was "too poppy".<ref>Humphries (1997), p. 36.</ref> De Burgh went on to graduate from [[Trinity College Dublin]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Alumni Awardees 2009/10 - Trinity Development & Alumni - Trinity College Dublin |url=https://www.tcd.ie/alumni/news-events/awards/2009.php |access-date=2 August 2023 |website=www.tcd.ie}}</ref> with a Master of Arts degree in French, English and History.

==Musical career==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2019}}

===Early career===
Chris de Burgh signed his first contract with [[A&M Records]] in 1974, and supported [[Supertramp]] on their Crime of the Century tour, building himself a small fan base. His début album, ''[[Far Beyond These Castle Walls]]'', was a folk-tinged stab at fantasy in the tradition of the [[The Moody Blues|Moody Blues]]. It failed to chart upon its release in late 1974. A few months later, he released a single called "Turning Round" from the album, released outside the UK and Ireland as "Flying". It failed to make an impression in the UK, but it stayed on top of the Brazilian charts for 17 weeks. This became a familiar pattern for the singer/songwriter, as every one of his 1970s albums failed to chart in the UK or US while they racked up big sales in continental European and South American countries.

In 1975 his second album, ''[[Spanish Train and Other Stories]]'', was released. Whilst (again) not a huge commercial success, the album and tour expanded the fan base, with de Burgh starting to attract a cult following. Along with the epic title track, other fan favourite tracks from the album included "Patricia The Stripper" and "[[A Spaceman Came Travelling]]" (the latter released the following year as a single).  The album made the lower end of the Canadian charts, giving De Burgh his first North American chart exposure; he would maintain a following and consistently chart in Canada for the rest of his major label career.

1977's third album, ''[[At the End of a Perfect Day]]'', whilst well received and featuring both former [[Fairport Convention]] drummer [[Dave Mattacks]] and later Fairport drummer [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]], failed to push de Burgh's career significantly, leading to the release of his fourth album ''[[Crusader (Chris de Burgh album)|Crusader]]'' in 1979. ''Crusader'' took a more electric direction, including guitar contributions from [[Ian Bairnson]] (formerly of [[Pilot (Scottish band)|Pilot]]), bass player [[David Paton]] (also of Pilot), and drummer [[Stuart Elliott (drummer)|Stuart Elliott]] (formerly of both Cockney Rebel and of [[Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel]]),  a.k.a. Alan Parsons’ band, all of whom were also working at the time with [[Kate Bush]]. The album also featured [[Sky (English/Australian band)|Sky]] keyboard player [[Francis Monkman]] and [[Michael Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]]. Whilst it attracted a significant number of new fans, ''Crusader'' still failed to break through in the UK and US. 1980's ''[[Eastern Wind]]'' also failed to build further on the (still cult) following in the major territories.

===International success===
In 1981, de Burgh had his first UK chart entry with ''[[Best Moves]]'', a collection culled from his early albums. It set the stage for 1982's [[Rupert Hine]] produced ''[[The Getaway (Chris de Burgh album)|The Getaway]]'', which reached number 30 in the UK charts and number 43 in the US, thanks to the single "[[Don't Pay the Ferryman]]".

In 1984, Chris de Burgh's follow-up album, ''[[Man on the Line]]'', also performed well, charting at 69 in the US and 11 in the UK (topping the charts in Germany and Switzerland<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/album/Chris-De-Burgh/Man-On-The-Line-113 |title=Chris De Burgh - Man On The Line |publisher=hitparade.ch |date= |access-date=8 May 2022}}</ref>); its first single "High on Emotion" became an international success, reaching the Top 20 in several countries<ref>{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=https://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Chris+De+Burgh&titel=High+On+Emotion&cat=s |title=Chris De Burgh - High On Emotion |publisher=lescharts.com |date= |access-date=8 May 2022}}</ref> (entering notably the Top 5 in Ireland,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://irishcharts.ie/search/placement |website=The Irish Charts |access-date=8 May 2022|title=The Irish Charts - All there is to know }}</ref> France and Switzerland) and the Top 50 in both the UK<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/high-on-emotion/ | title=High on emotion &#124; full Official Chart History |website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] }}</ref> and US.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/chris-de-burgh/chart-history/hsi/ |title=Chris de Burgh |magazine=Billboard |date=8 June 2021 |access-date=8 May 2022}}</ref>

Chris de Burgh had an across-the-board hit single with the [[Sentimental ballad|ballad]] "[[The Lady in Red (Chris de Burgh song)|The Lady in Red]]" in late 1986; the song became a number one hit in the UK (number three in America) and a worldwide success,<ref>{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=Chris+De+Burgh&titel=The+Lady+In+Red&cat=s |title=charts.org.nz - Chris De Burgh - The Lady In Red |publisher=Charts.nz |date= |access-date=8 May 2022}}</ref> its accompanying album, ''[[Into the Light (Chris de Burgh album)|Into the Light]]'', reached number two in the UK (number 25 in the U.S.). That Christmas season, a re-release of de Burgh's 1976 Christmas song "[[A Spaceman Came Travelling]]" became a Top 40 hit in the UK.

''[[Flying Colours (Chris de Burgh album)|Flying Colours]]'', his follow-up to ''[[Into the Light (Chris de Burgh album)|Into the Light]]'', entered the British charts at number one upon its 1988 release, yet it failed to make the American charts. De Burgh has not had another hit in the US and his commercial fortunes began to slide in Britain in the early 1990s, yet he retained a following around the world.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=https://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Chris+De+Burgh&titel=Power+Of+Ten&cat=a |title=Chris De Burgh - Power Of Ten |publisher=dutchcharts.nl |date= |access-date=8 May 2022}}</ref> This is mainly due to inactivity of his previous recording label [[A&M Records]] UK division in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdeb.com/cdebnew/faq.html#q8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019233103/http://www.cdeb.com/cdebnew/faq.html|title=FAQ Answers|archive-date=19 October 2010}}</ref>

In 1997 de Burgh composed a song entitled "There's a New Star Up in Heaven Tonight", dedicated to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. The song was released as a 100-copy limited edition and included on the compilations ''[[The Ultimate Collection (Chris de Burgh album)|The Ultimate Collection]]'' (2000) and ''[[Now and Then (Chris de Burgh album)|Now and Then]]'' (2009).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdeb.com/now-and-then/ |title=Now and Then |work=Official Chris de Burgh website |access-date=21 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016233318/http://cdeb.com/now-and-then/ |archive-date=16 October 2012 }}</ref>

===2007–2021===
In 2007 a concert in Tehran was planned for mid-2008, together with local band [[Arian (band)|Arian]], which would have made Chris de Burgh the first western pop singer to perform in Iran since the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]]. However, the concert never went ahead because he had not been given permission by the Iranian authorities to perform in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/19/chris.de.burgh.iran.gig|title=No permission for Chris de Burgh Iran gig|work=The Guardian |date=19 August 2008|first=Sean|last=Michaels|access-date=12 December 2011|location=London}}</ref>

In 2008, de Burgh released ''[[Footsteps (album)|Footsteps]]'', his seventeenth album including cover versions of thirteen songs that inspired him throughout his career,<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|title = Footsteps – Chris de Burgh|url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/footsteps-mw0000819477|website = AllMusic|access-date = 25 December 2015}}</ref> by artists like [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Beatles]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]] and [[Pete Seeger]];<ref name="allmusic"/> the album reached the Top 5 in UK.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/footsteps/ | title=Footsteps &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company | website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] }}</ref> In 2011, de Burgh released his follow-up, ''[[Footsteps 2]]'', which entered the UK Top 40. <ref>{{Cite web |title=FOOTSTEPS 2 by CHRIS DE BURGH |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/albums/chris-de-burgh-footsteps-2/ |website=OfficialCharts.com}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Chris de Burgh has been married to his wife Diane since 1977. They lived in [[Dalkey]], [[Dublin]]; in 1997, the couple moved to the Bushey Park Estate in [[Enniskerry]], [[County Wicklow]]. They sold Bushey Park in 2023.<ref>[https://evoke.ie/2023/09/16/life-style/property/chris-de-burgh-house-sells 'Chris de Burgh sells his Wicklow mansion for €9.3m after four years'], ''Evoke'', 16 September 2023</ref>
They have two sons, Hubie and Michael, and a daughter, [[Rosanna Davison|Rosanna]], best known as the winner of the [[Miss World]] competition in 2003 for Ireland. His second cousin,<ref>Burke's Irish Family Records, 1976, pp.342–3.</ref> [[Danny Kinahan]] of [[Castle Upton]], served as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|South Antrim]] between [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]] and [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]].

In 1994 he was found to have had an affair with his children's 19-year-old Irish nanny, Maresa Morgan, who was assisting the family while de Burgh's wife Diane was recuperating in the hospital from a broken neck suffered during a horse-riding accident. De Burgh later said he felt very guilty about the affair and subsequently reconciled with his wife.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6045550.stm |title=Faces of the week |work=BBC News  |access-date=24 February 2017 |date=13 October 2006}}</ref>

In 2011, bottles from de Burgh's vintage wine cellar sold for over $500,000, including a world record set for a magnum collection of postwar vintages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12858155|title=Chris de Burgh red wine collection goes for a song|work=BBC News|date=25 March 2011|access-date=19 May 2013}}</ref>

De Burgh has an interest in war history, especially that of the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World wars. His songs contain numerous references to soldiers and battle, and in 2006 he purchased a rare First World War letter written by an unknown soldier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2006/11/07/singer-buys-first-world-war-letter-345264/|title=Singer buys First World War letter|work=[[Metro International|Metro News]]|date=7 November 2006|access-date=19 May 2013}}</ref>

He enjoys classical music, including [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Johann Pachelbel|Pachelbel]].<ref>{{Cite journal |date=November 1994 |title=Person to Person Extra! |url=https://www.chris-de-burgh.co.uk/assets/gazette/199411.pdf |journal=The New Chris de Burgh Club Getaway Gazette |issue=November 1994 |pages=2-3}}</ref>

De Burgh has said that he is "certainly a believer in [[Christ]]", but he has always had a deep distrust of organized religion.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.insideworldmusic.com/library/weekly/aa051704d.htm | title= Chris de Burgh: Still High on Emotion | date=17 May 2004|publisher=Inside World Music | access-date=31 July 2014}}</ref> De Burgh believes in the power of spiritual healing as an alternative therapy to reduce pain. He claims that he has been able to heal people with his own hands and that he gained an "all-encompassing strength" that was contacted through prayer.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6033139.stm | title= De Burgh tells of 'healing' hands | work=BBC News | date=9 October 2006 | access-date=31 July 2014}}</ref>

==Media profile==
During the 1970s, de Burgh received mainly positive feedback from the music press, as he attempted to build his career. Since the release of "The Lady in Red" in 1986, both the music and news media have become significantly more negative towards him, both personally and professionally.{{citation needed|date=April 2024}}

De Burgh has pursued and won 16 defamation actions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/independent-woman/celebrity-news-gossip/real-winner-is-common-sense-in-jury-awards-2660143.html |title=Real winner is common sense in jury awards |work=Irish Independent|date=28 May 2011 |access-date=1 January 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Irish Independent]]'' said he has always been a bit prickly about criticism. Peter Crawley, a theatre reviewer at ''[[The Irish Times]]'', received a directed response from de Burgh when he wrote a less than sympathetic review of de Burgh's show in Dublin's [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]] in September 2009. Crawley wrote: "He departs the stage for 'Lady in Red', invading boxes and draping himself over audience members ... Certain toes will never uncurl after this experience, but it is almost admirable how unaltered de Burgh has remained by the flow of time."<ref>[https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/chris-de-burgh-is-an-angry-misunderstood-man-apparently/ Chris de Burgh is an Angry, Misunderstood, Man. Apparently.], ''[[The Spectator]]'', 11 September 2009</ref> In a lengthy, much-publicised reply to the critic, de Burgh made his feelings known, particularly in the [[postscript]]:
