'''Jeffrey Scott Buckley''' (raised as '''Scott Moorhead''';{{sfn|Browne|2001|page=58}} November 17, 1966&nbsp;– May 29, 1997) was an American musician. After a decade as a [[session guitarist]] in Los Angeles, he attracted a cult following in the early 1990s performing at venues in the [[East Village, Manhattan]]. He signed with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], recruited a band, and released his only studio album, ''[[Grace (Jeff Buckley album)|Grace]]'', in 1994. Buckley toured extensively to promote ''Grace'', with concerts in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia.

In 1996, Buckley worked on his second album with the working title ''[[My Sweetheart the Drunk]]'' in New York City with [[Tom Verlaine]] as the producer. In February 1997, he resumed work after moving to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. On May 29, while awaiting the arrival of his band from New York, Buckley drowned while swimming in the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River]], a tributary of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. Posthumous releases include a collection of four-track demos and studio recordings for ''My Sweetheart the Drunk'', and reissues of ''Grace'' and the ''[[Live at Sin-é]]'' EP.

After Buckley's death, his critical standing grew, and he has been cited as an influence by singers such as [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]] and [[Matt Bellamy]] of [[Muse (band)|Muse]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included ''Grace'' in three of its lists of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums]] and named Buckley's version of the [[Leonard Cohen]] song "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]" one of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|the 500 greatest songs]]. In 2014, Buckley's  version of "Hallelujah" was inducted into the American [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Recording Registry]].

==Career==
In Los Angeles, Buckley spent six years working in a hotel and playing guitar in various bands, playing in styles from jazz, [[reggae]], and [[roots rock]] to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].{{sfn|Browne|2001|pages=99–103}} He toured with the [[dancehall]] reggae artist [[Shinehead]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Kane|first=Rebecca|title=What was his musical history?|website=jeffbuckley.com|date=May 25, 1998| url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/05musihist.html|access-date=June 13, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063540/http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/05musihist.html|archive-date=May 9, 2008}}</ref> and played occasional [[funk]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] studio [[session musician|sessions]], collaborating with the fledgling producer [[Michael J.

Buckley moved to New York City in February 1990{{sfn|Browne|2001|page=104}} but found few opportunities to work as a musician. He was introduced to [[Qawwali]], the Sufi devotional music of Pakistan, and [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], one of its best-known singers.{{sfn|Browne|2001|pages=106–07}} Buckley was an impassioned fan of Khan,<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Paul|title=Talking Music: Confessing to Strangers|website=Buzz Magazine|via=jeffbuckley.com| year=1994| url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/words/interviews/buzz.html|access-date=June 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509065629/http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/words/interviews/buzz.html|archive-date=May 9, 2008}}</ref> and during what he called his "café days", he often covered Khan's songs. In January 1996, he interviewed Khan for ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' and wrote liner notes for Khan's ''Supreme Collection, Vol. 1'' compilation. He also became interested in the blues musician [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] and the [[hardcore punk]] band [[Bad Brains]] during this time.<ref name="TheArrivalof"/>

Buckley moved back to Los Angeles in September when his father's former manager, [[Herb Cohen]], offered to help him record his first demo of original songs. Buckley completed ''Babylon Dungeon Sessions'', a four-song cassette that included the songs "[[Eternal Life (song)|Eternal Life]]", "[[Last Goodbye (Jeff Buckley song)|Last Goodbye]]", "Strawberry Street" and punk screamer "Radio".{{sfn|Browne|2001|page=205}} Cohen and Buckley hoped to attract industry attention with the demo tape.{{sfn|Browne|2001|pages=108–109}}

Buckley flew back to New York early the following year to make his public singing debut at a tribute concert for his father, Greetings from Tim Buckley.{{sfn|Browne|2001|pages=130–134}} The event, produced by [[Hal Willner]], was held at [[St. Ann and the Holy Trinity Church|St. Ann's Church]] in [[Brooklyn]] on April 26, 1991.{{sfn|Browne|2001|pages=130–134}} Buckley rejected the idea of the concert as a springboard to his career, instead citing personal reasons regarding his decision to sing at the tribute.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kane|first=Rebecca|title=What was Jeff's public debut?|website=jeffbuckley.com|date=May 26, 1998|url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/06debut.html|access-date=June 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510140953/http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/06debut.html|archive-date=May 10, 2008}}</ref>

Accompanied by the experimental rock guitarist [[Gary Lucas]], Buckley performed "I Never Asked To Be Your Mountain", a song Tim Buckley wrote about the infant Jeff and his mother.{{sfn|Browne|2001|pages=136–137}} He returned to play "Sefronia&nbsp;– The King's Chain", "Phantasmagoria in Two", and concluded with "Once I Was" performed acoustically with an impromptu [[a cappella]] ending, due to a snapped guitar string.{{sfn|Browne|2001|pages=136–137}} Willner, the show's organizer, recalled that Buckley made a strong impression.<ref name="ManishBoy">{{cite magazine|last=Arcade|first=Penny|title=Mannish Boy, Setting Sun|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|via=pennyarcade.tv|date=June 1997|url=http://www.pennyarcade.tv/friends/jeff_buckley.html|access-date=June 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525103410/http://www.pennyarcade.tv/friends/jeff_buckley.html|archive-date=May 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Buckley's performance was counter to his desire to distance himself musically from his father; he later said: "It wasn't my work, it wasn't my life. But it bothered me that I hadn't been to his funeral, that I'd never been able to tell him anything. I used that show to pay my last respects."<ref name="TheSonAlsoRises" /> The concert proved to be Buckley's first step into the music industry that had eluded him for years.{{sfn|Browne|2001|page=138}}

On subsequent trips to New York in mid-1991, Buckley began co-writing with Gary Lucas, resulting in the songs "[[Grace (Jeff Buckley song)|Grace]]" and "[[Mojo Pin]]".{{sfn|Browne|2001|pages=140–141}} In late 1991, he began performing with Lucas's band [[Gods and Monsters (band)|Gods and Monsters]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kane|first=Rebecca|title=Jeff Buckley Tourography: 1991–1993| website=jeffbuckley.com|year=1999|url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/tourography/kfaktourog1.html|access-date=June 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509055450/http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/tourography/kfaktourog1.html|archive-date=May 9, 2008}}</ref> After being offered a development deal as a member of Gods and Monsters at Imago Records, Buckley moved to [[Lower East Side|the Lower East Side, Manhattan]], at the end of 1991.{{sfn|Browne|2001|page=142}} The day after Gods and Monsters officially debuted in March 1992, he decided to leave the band.{{sfn|Browne|2001|page=146}}

===Concert tours===
Buckley spent much of the next year and a half touring internationally to promote ''Grace''. Following Buckley's ''Peyote Radio Theater'' tour, the band began a European tour on August 23, 1994, starting with performances in the UK and Ireland. The tour continued in Scandinavia and, throughout September, numerous concerts in Germany were played. The tour ended on September 22 with a concert in Paris. A gig on September 24 in New York dovetailed with the end of the European tour and Buckley and band spent the next month relaxing and rehearsing.<ref name="PastTours">{{cite web|title=Past tour dates|website=jeffbuckley.com|url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/news.asp?id=10|access-date=March 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409161821/http://www.jeffbuckley.com/news.asp?id=10|archive-date=April 9, 2008}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2024}}

A tour of Canada and the U.S. began on October 19, 1994, at [[CBGB]], New York City. The tour was far reaching with concerts held on both East and West Coasts of the U.S. and a number of performances in central and southern states. The tour ended two months later on December 18 at [[Maxwell's]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].<ref name="PastTours"/>{{Failed verification|date=September 2024}} After another month of rest and rehearsal, the band commenced a second European tour, this time mainly for promotion purposes.

The band returned to Europe on February 6. He toured various Western European countries before returning to the U.S. on March 6. Among the gigs performed during this period, Buckley and his band performed at a 19th-century-built French venue, the [[Bataclan (theatre)|Bataclan]], and material from the concert was recorded and later released in October of that year as a four track [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Live from the Bataclan]]''. Songs from a performance on February 25, at the venue Nighttown in [[Rotterdam]], were released as a promotional-only CD, ''[[The Grace EPs|So Real]]''.<ref name="PastTours"/>{{Failed verification|date=September 2024}}

Touring recommenced in April with dates across the U.S. and Canada. During this period, Buckley and the band played [[Metro Chicago|Metro]] in Chicago, which was recorded on video and later released as ''[[Live in Chicago (Jeff Buckley)|Live in Chicago]]'' on [[VHS]] and later on [[DVD]]. In addition, on June 4 they played at [[Sony Music Studios]] for the Sony Music radio hour. Following this was a month-long European tour between June 20 and July 18 in which they played many summer [[music festivals]], including the [[Glastonbury Festival]] and the 1995 [[Meltdown Festival]] (at which Buckley sang [[Henry Purcell]]'s "[[Dido's Lament]]"<ref>{{cite episode|title=Dido's Lament|series=Soul Music|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]|air-date=March 9, 2010}}</ref> at the invitation of [[Elvis Costello]]).{{sfn|Browne|2001|page=266}} During the tour, Buckley played two concerts at the [[Paris Olympia]], a venue made famous by the French vocalist [[Édith Piaf]].

Buckley's ''Mystery White Boy'' tour, playing concerts in both Sydney and [[Melbourne]], Australia, lasted between August 28 and September 6 and recordings of these performances were compiled and released on the live album ''[[Mystery White Boy]]''. Buckley was so well received during these concerts that his album ''Grace'' went [[Gold album|gold]] in Australia, selling over 35,000 copies, and taking this into account he decided a longer tour was needed and returned for a tour of New Zealand and Australia in February the following year.<ref name=JBcomBio/>

Between the two Oceanian tours, Buckley and the band took a break from touring.

Much of the material from the tours of 1995 and 1996 was recorded and released on either promotional EPs, such as the ''[[The Grace EPs|Grace EP]]'', or posthumously on albums, such as ''Mystery White Boy'' (a reference to Buckley not using his real name) and ''Live à L'Olympia''.

==Musical style==
Buckley possessed a [[tenor]] [[vocal range]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/music/western_tradition/music_voices1.shtml |title=Vocal range| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017000711/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/music/western_tradition/music_voices1.shtml |publisher=BBC Bitesize|archive-date=October 17, 2015|access-date=February 13, 2012}}</ref> He cited singers including [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Patti Smith]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]] as influences. He said: "Siouxsie, I have much of her influence in my voice".{{sfn|Reynolds|2008|p=145}} Buckley made full use of this range in his performances, particularly in the songs from ''Grace'', and reached peaks of high G in the tenor range at the culmination of "Grace". "Corpus Christi Carol" was sung nearly entirely in a high [[falsetto]]. The pitch and volume of his singing was also highly variable, showcased in songs "Mojo Pin" and "Dream Brother", which began with mid-range quieter vocals, before reaching louder, higher peaks near the ending of the songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/07vocals.html |title=Jeff's vocal style and range |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420093253/http://www.jeffbuckley.com/rfuller/buckley/faq/07vocals.html |archive-date=April 20, 2015|website=JeffBuckley.com|access-date=February 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sputnikmusic.com/review/7147/Jeff-Buckley-Grace/|title=Jeff Buckley Grace|last=Dillon|first=Jared W.|date=May 26, 2006|work=Sputnik Music|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716164137/http://sputnikmusic.com/review/7147/Jeff-Buckley-Grace/|archive-date=July 16, 2012|access-date=February 13, 2012}}</ref>

Buckley played guitar in a variety of styles, ranging from the distorted rock of "Sky Is a Landfill", the [[jazz]] of "[[Strange Fruit]]", the [[country music|country]] styling of "Lost Highway", and the guitar [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]] style in "Hallelujah". He occasionally used a [[slide guitar]] in live performances as a solo act, as well as for the introduction of "Last Goodbye", when playing with a full band. His songs were written in various [[guitar tuning]]s which, apart from the [[Guitar tunings#Standard|EADGBE standard tuning]], included [[drop D tuning]] and an [[open G tuning]]. His guitar playing style varied from highly melodic songs, such as "[[The Twelfth of Never]]", to more [[percussion|percussive]] ones, such as "New Year's Prayer".<ref>''Jeff Buckley: Grace and Other Songs-Guitar Tab Edition-Music Book''.

Buckley also played a [[Rickenbacker 360/12]] along with several other guitars, including a black [[Gibson Les Paul Custom]] and a 1967 [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] F-50 acoustic. When on tour with his band, he used [[Fender Amplifiers|Fender amplifiers]] for a clean sound and [[Mesa Boogie]] amps for overdriven tones. While he was primarily a singer and guitarist, he also played other instruments on various studio recordings and sessions, including [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[dobro]], [[mandolin]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]] (heard on the intro to "[[Lover, You Should've Come Over]]"), [[organ (music)|organ]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|dulcimer]] ("[[Dream Brother]]" intro), [[tabla]], [[esraj]], and [[harmonica]].<ref name="instruments">{{cite web | url=http://www.jeffbuckley.com/pages/node/114 | title=What comprised Jeff's gear? | website=jeffbuckley.com | access-date=October 4, 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101235732/http://jeffbuckley.com/pages/node/114 | archive-date=November 1, 2010}}</ref>

Keith Foti, a [[Road crew|roadie]] in Buckley's band, remained on shore. After moving a radio and guitar out of reach from the wake from a passing tugboat, Foti looked up to see Buckley had vanished; the wake of the tugboat had swept him away from shore and under water. A rescue effort that night and the next morning by scuba teams and police was unsuccessful. On June 4, passengers on the ''[[American Queen]]'' riverboat spotted Buckley's body in the Wolf River, caught in branches.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jeff-buckleys-body-found-in-memphis-58208/|title=Jeff Buckley's Body Found In Memphis|last=Bendersky|first=Ari|date=June 6, 1997|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Schruers |first1=Fred |title=Jeff Buckley: Remembering the late 'Grace' singer-songwriter | date=August 7, 1997 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/jeff-buckley-rivers-edge-75789/ |magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 18, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/06/arts/jeff-buckley-30-who-wrote-and-sang-eclectic-folk-rock.html|title=Jeff Buckley, 30, Who Wrote And Sang Eclectic Folk-Rock|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 6, 1997}}</ref>

After Buckley's death, a collection of demo recordings and a full-length album he had been reworking for his second album were released as a compilation album, ''[[Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk]].'' It was overseen by his mother, Mary Guibert, band members and his friend [[Michael J. Clouse]], as well as [[Chris Cornell]]. It was certified gold in Australia in 1998.<ref>{{cite certification|region=Australia|certyear=1998| access-date = 2024-12-22}}</ref> Three other albums composed of live recordings have also been released, along with a live DVD of a performance in Chicago.
