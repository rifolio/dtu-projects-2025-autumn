==History==
===Early years (1991–1994)===
While still in high school in [[Ukiah, California]], lead vocalist [[Davey Havok]] formed a band called AFI in November 1991 with Mark Stopholese and Vic Chalker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afinewshq.com/2010/09/24/afinewshq-exclusive-interview-with-afis-original-bassist/|title=AFINewsHQ Exclusive Interview with AFI's Original Bassist|accessdate=2024-06-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307011942/http://afinewshq.com/2010/09/24/afinewshq-exclusive-interview-with-afis-original-bassist/|archive-date=March 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> At the time, the band did not know how to play any instruments. Stopholese suggested that his friend, drummer [[Adam Carson]], join the band.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070629225052/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10466716/more_havok/3 An Extended Interview With AFI's Davey Havok]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. [[Austin Scaggs]]. Jun 01, 2006</ref> Stopholese learned [[Electric guitar|guitar]] and Chalker learned [[Bass guitar|bass]], but Chalker was soon replaced by [[Geoff Kresge]]. By the end of October 1992, the band had played their first three shows, generally as an opener for a few other punk bands, including Influence 13, which featured future AFI guitarist [[Jade Puget]] and frequent collaborator [[Nick 13]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-11-04|title=AFI: Adam's Playlist|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CV3sybgPpBX/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/s/instagram/CV3sybgPpBX |archive-date=December 26, 2021 |url-access=registration|access-date=2021-11-18|website=[[Instagram]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> AFI recorded their first EP, ''[[Dork (EP)|Dork]]'' (1993), with the now defunct band Loose Change, which also featured Puget.

The band briefly broke up in 1993, when the members left Ukiah to attend different colleges. They decided to commit to AFI full-time after an extremely positive experience and enthusiastic crowd response at a reunion show they played at [[The Phoenix Theater]] over [[Christmas break]].<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|author=|title=AFI interview (1999)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDboO2yPIIs| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404081712/http://youtube.com/watch?v=HDboO2yPIIs| archive-date=2007-04-04 | url-status=dead|access-date=2011-07-04|publisher=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetrapset.net/160-adam-carson-afi/|title=THE TRAP SET|website=Thetrapset.net|access-date=June 14, 2021}}</ref>

AFI's first full-length album, ''[[Answer That and Stay Fashionable]]'' was released July 4, 1995, on Wingnut Records. It was {{nowrap|co-produced}} by Doug Sangalang and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]'s [[Tim Armstrong]] and [[Brett Reed]].

''Louder'' wrote, "Long before [[My Chemical Romance]] topped the charts with the anthemic ‘'[[Welcome to the Black Parade]]'’, California's AFI were already injecting their brand of punk with [[gothic fiction|gothic]] imagery and a sense of theatricality. By the time [[Gerard Way]]’s band arrived, AFI had already built a devoted fan base incorporating punks, hardcore fans, [[goth subculture|goths]], [[Heavy metal subculture|metallers]] and every other type of musical pariah imaginable. They were a band that couldn't help but stand out everywhere they went."<ref name="barnard"/> ''[[AllMusic]]'' described AFI as "Northern California hardcore punk revivalists" whose style "evolved to include alternative rock, post-punk, emo, and new wave flair".<ref name="allmusic"/> ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' said that the band "morphed from a conventional garage-punk band into a gothic-rock arena act."<ref name=Chicago/> ''[[Loudwire]]'' said that the band "developed from more of a SoCal punk style into a somewhat gothic post-hardcore band".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/afi-girls-not-grey-top-21st-century-hard-rock-songs/|title=No. 23: AFI, 'Girl's Not Grey' – Top 21st Century Hard Rock Songs|work=Loudwire|date=June 28, 2012 |access-date=21 December 2014}}</ref> ''The Encyclopedia of Popular Music'' said that "Although often described as a cross between goth rock and hardcore punk, by the time of their commercial breakthrough in 2003, [AFI] started out as a straight ahead skate/punk band."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |author=Colin Larkin |date=May 27, 2011 |quote=Although often described as a cross between goth rock and hardcore punk, by the time of their commercial breakthrough in 2003, the Ukiah, California, USA-based quartet AFI (an acronym for A Fire Inside) started out as a straight ahead skate/ punk band.}}</ref> ''[[PopMatters]]'' wrote, "To call California-based hardcore/screamo quartet A.F.I. a band without a flag in the current modern rock landscape is not an unfair assessment of their situation."<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.popmatters.com/review/afi-sing/ |title=A.F.I.: Sing the Sorrow |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |author=Stephen Haag |date=April 17, 2003}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' categorized the band as pop-punk.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-afis-davey-havok-on-his-emotions-and-hair-disasters-20131022 |title=Q&A: AFI's Davey Havok on His Emotions and Hair Disasters |magazine=Rolling Stone |last=Gentile |first=John |date=October 22, 2013}}</ref> AFI has often been labeled as "gothic punk" due to the band's appearance, but AFI band members never considered the label accurate.

Puget, who has produced much of the band's music, stated in 2021:
{{blockquote|Anyone who knows our catalog knows that no two records really sit together. Some sit a little closer, maybe. We do certain things, just by virtue of who we are, that are consistent, but those things come about organically. Every time we do something, I have to judge it on its own merits. Some fans are going to judge a new album, or a new song, based on what's come before. But as artists, we can't do that, because it would only hinder our creativity.<ref name=":1" />}}

==Influences==
AFI have drawn inspiration from a diverse range of artists. "We have many, many influences that span the musical spectrum", Havok told ''[[the Boston Globe]]''. "Each of us grew up on everything from punk to hardcore to dark '80s UK stuff like the Cure, [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], [[Joy Division]], and [[The Sisters of Mercy|[the] Sisters of Mercy]]. And there were rock bands like [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Metallica]] and industrial bands like [[Skinny Puppy]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Front 242]] and [[Alien Sex Fiend]].

==Legacy==
According to the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', AFI have been "hailed as being responsible for bringing back the big '80s rock chorus."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/07/1060145794806.html |title=Wreaking Havok |website=Smh.com.au |date=2003-08-08 |access-date=2016-05-06}}</ref> The band has received much praise in particular from ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', which has supported the group since the mid-1990s. The publication rated the band's major-label debut, ''Sing the Sorrow'', as the most anticipated album of 2003, and noted that it "blew the doors off goth-punk as we knew it".<ref name="altpress1">{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/jerryfinnalbums |title=Alternative Press &#124; Features &#124; The List on AP: 9 classic albums Jerry Finn left his mark with |publisher=Altpress.com |date=2008-10-20 |access-date=2012-03-29}}</ref> AFI has also been granted responsibility for paving the way for the rise of the visual element of rock bands in the 2000s; in a December 2006 article, ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' wrote that "AFI have increased the importance of a band's visual identity and the flair for the theatrical," adding that "when a group like [[Panic! at the Disco]] borrows imagery from a movie such as ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', you have to consider the precedent AFI set when they borrowed cues from [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://daveyfan.buzznet.com/user/photos/davey-and-adam/?id=3182616#id=3777383|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712102507/http://daveyfan.buzznet.com/user/photos/davey-and-adam/?id=3182616%23id=3777383|archive-date= July 12, 2012|url-status=dead|author=Revolver Magazine|edition=December 2006|title=Davey Havok has Agreed to Receive the Drag Queen|page=69|date=December 2006}}</ref> ''Shoutmouth.com'' placed AFI at number 22 on its list of the 25 most influential punk bands, noting that the band "have evolved with each album, showing that a punk band can not only change, but stay true to their sound at the same time.

"Full speed ahead". ''Yorkshire Evening Post''.</ref> Recognized by his trademark flair and vocal style, Havok has been recognized as "a bona fide rock god" by ''Alternative Press''.<ref name="altpress1" />

In 2003, [[The Pitch (newspaper)|''The Pitch'']] described the band's fan club as a "particularly excitable bunch", adding that "there's also the type of sentiments that put the ''cult'' back into cult success, such as links to something called 'the Church of Havok'."<ref name="tedder" />
