'''Accept''' is a German [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Solingen]], formed in 1968 by lead guitarist [[Wolf Hoffmann]], singer [[Udo Dirkschneider]] and bassist [[Peter Baltes]]. Their beginnings can be traced back to the late 1960s when the band got its earliest start under the name '''Band X'''. Their current lineup consists of Hoffmann, vocalist [[Mark Tornillo]], guitarist Philip Shouse, drummer Christopher Williams and bassist Martin Motnik. Accept has undergone numerous lineup changes, with Hoffmann being the only constant member. As of 2024, the band has released seventeen studio albums, five live albums and nine compilation albums.

Accept played an important role in the development of [[speed metal|speed]]<ref name="Speed Metal">[http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/biographie-groupe-Accept-id_bio-651-l-en.html "Accept : Biography"]. Spirit of Metal. Retrieved 11 December 2008. "In many ways, this album [''Restless and Wild''] was a milestone in Accept's career.

Accept achieved its first commercial success with their fifth studio album ''[[Balls to the Wall (album)|Balls to the Wall]]'' (1983), which is the band's only album to be [[Music recording certification|certified gold]] in the United States and Canada,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Accept%22 |title=RIAA Database Search for Accept |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA.com]] |access-date=25 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum/#!/gp_search=Accept |title=CRIA Database Search for Accept |publisher=[[Music Canada|musiccanada.com]] |access-date=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602053405/http://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum/#!/gp_search=Accept |archive-date=2 June 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and spawned their well-known hit "[[Balls to the Wall (song)|Balls to the Wall]]".

Accept has disbanded and reformed multiple times. They first split up in 1989, several months after the release of ''[[Eat the Heat]]'' (which was their only album with Dirkschneider's initial replacement [[David Reece]]), but reformed in 1992 with Dirkschneider and released three more albums before disbanding again in 1997. After briefly reuniting in 2005, Accept announced their third reunion in 2009, with former [[T.T. Quick]] frontman [[Mark Tornillo]] replacing Dirkschneider (who declined to participate),<ref name=reunion>{{cite web | date=15 May 2009 | title=Accept Recruits Ex-TT Quick Singer to Replace Udo Dirkschneider | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=120207 | access-date=15 May 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519082438/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=120207 | archive-date=19 May 2009 | url-status=live}}</ref> and the band has recorded six albums with him: ''[[Blood of the Nations]]'' (2010), ''[[Stalingrad (Accept album)|Stalingrad]]'' (2012), ''[[Blind Rage (album)|Blind Rage]]'' (2014), ''[[The Rise of Chaos]]'' (2017), ''[[Too Mean to Die]]'' (2021), and ''[[Humanoid (Accept album)|Humanoid]]'' (2024).

==History==
===Early years (1968–1982)===
Accept's beginnings can be traced back to 1968 when [[Udo Dirkschneider]] and [[Michael Wagener]] formed a local band called Band X with drummer Birke Hoe. In 1972, Dirkschneider put together a new line-up of Band X and changed its name to Accept,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.metalinside.de/band/accept | title=ACCEPT|website=Metalinside.de }}</ref> influenced by [[Accept (Chicken Shack album)|an album by that title]] by the British blues band [[Chicken Shack]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.chartsurfer.de/artist/accept/biography-cguu.html | title=Accept - Biografie|website=Chartsurfer.de }}</ref> For many years, Accept went through numerous line-up changes. This instability essentially kept the band on an amateur level, making sporadic appearances in festival concerts. Accept's professional career began in 1976, with Udo Dirkschneider, guitarist Gerhard Wahl, drummer Frank Friedrich, and new members Peter Baltes (bass) and Wolf Hoffmann (guitar), when they were invited to play at one of the first [[rock and roll]] festivals in Germany — Rock am Rhein. Following the festival, the band was offered a recording deal. Their first recording was the self-titled ''[[Accept (Accept album)|Accept]]'' album, which was released in 1979, but did not achieve much commercial success.

The first stable line-up of Accept was composed of vocalist Udo Dirkschneider, guitarists [[Wolf Hoffmann]] and [[Jörg Fischer]], bassist [[Peter Baltes]] and drummer Frank Friedrich. Friedrich quit the band after the release of ''Accept'' and was replaced by [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. This line-up recorded ''[[I'm a Rebel]]'' in 1980. The [[I'm a Rebel (song)|title track]] originally was written for [[AC/DC]] and recorded by the band but never released by them.<ref>[[Malcolm Dome|Dome, Malcolm]] and Ewing, Jerry. ''The AC/DC Encyclopaedia''. Chrome Dreams, 2008, pp. 101–102.</ref> The album brought some media attention, and the band was invited to make a televised appearance.

In 1981, Accept's third studio album, ''[[Breaker (Accept album)|Breaker]]'', was released, and the band employed manager [[Gaby Hoffmann (manager)|Gaby Hauke]]. The same year, Accept served as a supporting act on [[Judas Priest]]'s [[World Wide Blitz Tour]], and obtained attention outside of Europe for the first time.

The band's fourth studio album, ''[[Restless and Wild]]'' was released in 1982. Jörg Fischer left before the recording of the album began, as did his intended replacement, [[Jan Koemmet]].<ref>[http://www.metallian.com/accept.htm "Accept Interview"]. Metallian. Retrieved 7 August 2013.</ref><ref>Answer in the Ask Udo section of {{URL|www.udo-online.de}}.</ref> ''Restless and Wild'' saw an evolution in the band's sound, which incorporated characteristics defining the genre later dubbed [[speed metal]].<ref name="Speed Metal"/> One of the most notable tracks on the album is the opening track "[[Fast as a Shark]]", to which Kaufmann's kick drumming on the song is considered a precursor of [[thrash metal]], predating the debut albums of [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]] by a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/10-speed-metal-songs-released-before-thrash/|title=10 Pioneering Speed Metal Songs Released Before Thrash's Birth|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|date=25 April 2018|website=[[Loudwire]]|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-date=9 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220609065054/https://loudwire.com/10-speed-metal-songs-released-before-thrash/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/wolf_hoffmann_opines_on_accepts_contribution_to_the_thrash_and_speed_metal_genres.html|title=Wolf Hoffmann Opines on Accept's Contribution to the Thrash and Speed Metal Genres|author=cycoloco|website=[[Ultimate Guitar]]|date=15 September 2022|access-date=24 September 2025}}</ref> Gaby Hauke was credited as "Deaffy" on two of the album's tracks.

===Mainstream success (1983–1987)===
Accept's fifth studio album, ''[[Balls to the Wall (album)|Balls to the Wall]]'', was released in 1983, now with guitarist [[Herman Frank]] (ex-[[Sinner (band)|Sinner]]). Udo Dirkschneider also left the band at this time but returned when the album was being recorded.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=ACCEPT / U.D.O. |url=https://www.accept-archive.ru/interview/2002MetallianinterviewWolf.html |access-date=2025-04-05 |website=Accept-archive.ru}}</ref> The album was more conceptual and included lyrical themes about [[politics]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and human relationships. For example, the title track "[[Balls to the Wall (song)|Balls to the Wall]]" refers to slaves revolting against oppressing masters, while "Fight It Back" is about social misfits fighting against conformity. All songs were credited to Accept and "Deaffy". Deaffy was manager [[Gaby Hoffmann (manager)|Gaby Hauke]]'s pseudonym as the band's lyricist, although she did not officially claim ownership until the band had broken up for the second time.

During a 1983 show in their hometown, the band met Jörg Fischer by chance and on Hauke's insistence, Fischer rejoined the band. A world tour followed through 1984, including the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival. By this time, the band was supported by [[Bad Steve]], a band which was led by former Accept and Band X members [[Dieter Rubach]], [[Jan Koemmet]] and Frank Friedrich. The band also opened for [[Iron Maiden]] on their [[World Slavery Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Iron Maiden Commentary – Tours – World Slavery Tour 1984-85 – Dates and Venues|url=http://www.ironmaidencommentary.com/?url=tour09_fotd/dates09_fotd&lang=eng&link=tours|work=Ironmaidencommentary.com|access-date=16 June 2021}}</ref>

''[[Metal Heart]]'' was released in 1985. Produced by [[Dieter Dierks]] (then-known for working with [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]), it presented the band's creative peak. Accept toured the world supporting the album,<ref name="Inc.1985">{{cite magazine|title=Box Score Top Grossing Concerts|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT48|date=1 June 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=48–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and documented the live shows with the live mini-album ''[[Kaizoku-Ban]]''.

The follow-up, ''[[Russian Roulette (Accept album)|Russian Roulette]]'', was released in 1986. In 1987, Udo Dirkschneider was fired from the band,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q7F-3xea-g |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/8q7F-3xea-g |archive-date=21 December 2021 |url-status=live|title=Udo Dirkschneider Interview – All about Accept (English Subtitles)|last=Neon Sunsets – The 80s Channel|date=25 March 2016|access-date=22 March 2018|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> and later decided to embark on a solo career. According to Wolf Hoffmann, Dirkschneider was never fired but it was rather a mutual decision within the band to part ways.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://metallian.com/accept.php#acceptinter | title=Wolf Hoffmann gives www.metallian.com an exclusive and revealing look at the career of heavy metal legends Accept – 17.06.2002|website=Metallain.com}}</ref> Supporting this decision, the songwriting team in Accept wrote his entire solo album, released in 1987 as ''[[Animal House (U.D.O. album)|Animal House]]'' under the band moniker [[U.D.O.]]

===David Reece period and first hiatus (1988–1991)===
Parallel to work on ''Animal House'', Accept started to audition vocalists. The band tried out a few singers, including [[Ken Tamplin]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Ken Tamplin Vocal Academy|title=Vocal Coach Reacts To Scorpions – Klaus Meine – Still Loving You – Ken Tamplin|date=1 July 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67fofFjbyo4 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/67fofFjbyo4 |archive-date=21 December 2021 |url-status=live|access-date=4 July 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> and [[Baby Tuckoo]] singer [[Rob Armitage (singer)|Rob Armitage]], whom they even featured in promo photos and metal magazine interviews, and also recorded demos with. Armitage also performed live with the band and one of the shows with him was reviewed by ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine. However, American vocalist [[David Reece]] was chosen and this new lineup recorded and released ''[[Eat the Heat]]'' in 1989. Accept toured in support of the album that year with bands like [[Metal Church]], [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]], [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] and [[Armored Saint]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Metal Church|url=http://metallipromo.com/mchurch.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Armored Saint|url=http://www.metallipromo.com/armored.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref>

Accept's career came to a sudden halt when Stefan Kaufmann sustained a serious injury to his back during the tour in support of the album. He was briefly replaced by [[House of Lords (band)|House of Lords]] drummer [[Ken Mary]] for the remainder of the US tour. By the time the tour ended in late 1989, the band decided that without Kaufmann, and with differences surfacing with Reece, it was time to cease their activities for the time being.

===Reunion with Dirkschneider (1992–1996)===
[[File:Accept-04.jpg|thumb|left|Former lead singer Udo Dirkschneider (right) during Accept's reunion tour in 2005]]
The live album ''[[Staying a Life]]'', recorded in 1985, was released in 1990 as a souvenir celebrating their career.

A few years later the ex-members met with Dirkschneider and decided to relaunch the band with core members Hoffmann, Kaufmann, Dirkschneider and Baltes.

Their comeback album, ''[[Objection Overruled (album)|Objection Overruled]]'', was released in 1993 and was a qualified success in Europe and the United States. [[Arjen Lucassen]] of [[Vengeance (band)|Vengeance]] was hired as touring guitarist but ended up leaving before the tour started.<ref name=":0" /> A world tour followed, and another album, entitled ''[[Death Row (album)|Death Row]]'', was released in the following year. Kaufmann became unable to play once again due to his recurring back injury and Stefan Schwarzmann became the temporary replacement.

''[[Predator (album)|Predator]]'' (1996) was recorded in Nashville, with Udo's long-time (school) friend and producer [[Michael Wagener]] at the helm and with [[Michael Cartellone]] (from [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]]) filling in on drums. Accept's tour supporting ''Predator'' took place in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, with their last concert in Tokyo, Japan.

===Second hiatus and brief reunion (1997–2005)===
Between 1997 and 2005, all the members continued working on their own projects. In 2005, Accept received an invitation from various European promoters for a short summer European Festival tour with Accept's classic line-up (Hoffmann, Baltes, Dirkschneider, Frank and Schwarzmann). These festivals turned out to be a stunning success, with the last show on 27 August 2005 in [[Kavarna]], Bulgaria, at the [[Kaliakra Rock Fest]].

Asked in May 2007 by Lords of Metal if Accept was planning on writing and recording new music in the future, Dirkschneider replied:
{{quote|That would be a problem. You know, it's easy to play the old songs, because they already exist. Especially for me, it was easier, because I still do those classics with U.D.O., but for some of the guys it was a bit harder. But everybody did a great job on stage. I understand that people want a new Accept album, but composing songs together would have been a disaster. That way we would destroy more than we would create. We have a good relationship now and it's best to keep it that way.<ref name=futurealbum>{{cite web | date=May 1, 2007 | title=Udo Dirkschneider says it would be a 'problem' to write new Accept songs with Wolf Hoffmann | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=72908 | access-date=May 19, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523101054/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=72908 | archive-date=May 23, 2007 | url-status=live}}</ref>}}

On 14 May 2009, Udo Dirkschneider officially announced that he would not be participating in the rumoured Accept reunion.<ref>{{cite web | date=14 May 2009 | title=No Accept Reunion in the Works | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=72908 | access-date=15 May 2009}}</ref>

===Return with Mark Tornillo and ''Blood of the Nations'' (2009–2011)===
[[File:AcceptStockolm2010-2.JPG|thumb|210px|right|Mark Tornillo (pictured in the middle) with guitarist Wolf Hoffmann in Stockholm, 20 May 2010. Tornillo replaced Udo Dirkschneider as the band's vocalist when Accept reformed in 2009.]]

At the end of May 2009, rumors again surfaced of a possible Accept reformation, when bassist [[Peter Baltes]] revealed he spent a weekend at his house in Pennsylvania "shredding away" with guitarist [[Wolf Hoffmann]]. "Something amazing is in the works", Baltes explained. "As soon as I can, I'll let everybody know. Let's make the 'Metal Heart' beat again."

A coincidental meeting between Accept and former [[T.T. Quick]] singer Mark Tornillo at this informal jam session occurred shortly after Tornillo was announced as the new vocalist.<ref name=reunion/>

A new album was written and recorded with [[Andy Sneap]] (of [[Megadeth]], [[Sabbat (English band)|Sabbat]], [[Blaze Bayley|BLAZE]], [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Arch Enemy]] and [[Onslaught (band)|Onslaught]] fame) as producer. Titled ''[[Blood of the Nations]]'', it was the first original Accept album in fourteen years.<ref>{{cite web |author=Diamond Oz |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=53004 |title=Accept Reveals New Album Title – in Metal News |publisher=Metal Underground.com |date=13 February 2010 |access-date=11 November 2010}}</ref>

The new line-up made their live debut on 8 May 2010 at the Gramercy Theatre in New York City, their first American concert in fifteen years.<ref>{{cite web | date=11 May 2010 | title=Restless And Wild Again, Accept Storms New York City | publisher=[[Attention Deficit Delirium]] | url=http://bryanreesman.com/blog/2010/05/11/restless-and-wild-again-accept-storms-new-york-city/ | access-date=28 July 2010}}</ref>

On 21 May 2010, the video for "Teutonic Terror" was number 5 on the worldwide video charts in all genres on MySpace, topping such artists as [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Christina Aguilera]]. The video also topped the MySpace Global Metal Charts at number 1.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

On 13 June 2010, Accept opened for [[AC/DC]] in Stuttgart, Germany, and on 25 June 2010, they headlined the [[Sonisphere Festival]] in Romania and Turkey. With a set of over two hours, classics like "Balls to the Wall", "Metal Heart" and "Princess of the Dawn" were played along with the new album material. ''[[Blood of the Nations]]'' was released in Europe on 20 August 2010 and made a chart debut at number 4 in the official German Media Control Charts, the band's second-highest chart debut in their career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=145321 |title=Accept's 'Blood of the Nations' Cracks German Top 5 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=31 August 2010 |access-date=11 November 2010}}</ref>

''[[Blood of the Nations]]'' was released on 4 September 2010 in Japan, and on 18 September in the United States. Accept spent 80 days on a summer tour traveling over 65,000&nbsp;km and playing for over 450,000 fans. In October, the band appeared at the prestigious Japanese festival [[Loud Park Festival|Loud Park]] outside of Tokyo to 40,000 fans along with [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Motörhead]] and [[Stone Sour]].

Within a month of the release of ''Blood of the Nations'', Wolf Hoffmann told "Metal Asylum": "We are already thinking about and writing for the next record. We've all missed doing Accept and we realized we missed doing this. Of course, we are not 20 years old anymore and not ready to do just anything to be successful, we're not that desperate. [laughs] We are looking to do what makes sense and that's fun."<ref name=newmusic>{{cite web | date=27 September 2010 | title=Accept Guitarist: 'We Are Already Thinking About and Writing for the Next Record' | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=146759 | access-date=24 March 2011}}</ref>
