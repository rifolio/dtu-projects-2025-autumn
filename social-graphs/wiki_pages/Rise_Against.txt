'''Rise Against''' is an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Chicago]], formed in 1999. The group's current line-up comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist [[Tim McIlrath]], lead guitarist [[Zach Blair]], bassist [[Joe Principe]] and drummer [[Brandon Barnes]]. Rise Against's music emphasizes [[melody]], catchy [[Hook (music)|hooks]], an aggressive sound and playstyle, and rapid [[tempo]]s. Lyrically, the band is known for their [[social commentary]], covering a wide range of topics such as [[politics in the United States|politics]], [[animal rights]], [[humanitarianism]], and [[environmentalism]].

The band spent its first four years signed to the independent record label [[Fat Wreck Chords]], on which they released two studio albums, ''[[The Unraveling (Rise Against album)|The Unraveling]]'' (2001) and ''[[Revolutions per Minute (Rise Against album)|Revolutions per Minute]]'' (2003). Both the albums were met with underground success, and in 2003 the band signed with the [[major label]] [[DreamWorks Records|Dreamworks]], which was absorbed by [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]. Rise Against's major label debut ''[[Siren Song of the Counter Culture]]'' (2004) brought the band mainstream success, largely in part to the popularity of the singles "[[Give It All]]" and "[[Swing Life Away]]". The band's next album, ''[[The Sufferer & the Witness]]'' (2006), peaked at number ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States, and was Rise Against's first album to chart in countries outside of North America.

With the release of ''[[Appeal to Reason (album)|Appeal to Reason]]'' (2008), Rise Against's music shifted toward a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. The album's third single, "[[Savior (Rise Against song)|Savior]]", broke the record for the most consecutive weeks spent on both the [[Hot Rock Songs]] and [[Alternative Songs]] charts. Rise Against's popularity grew with the release of ''[[Endgame (Rise Against album)|Endgame]]'' (2011), which peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200, and charted highly worldwide. The band's seventh and eighth albums, ''[[The Black Market (Rise Against album)|The Black Market]]'' (2014) and ''[[Wolves (Rise Against album)|Wolves]]'' (2017), continued the trend of commercial success, and both peaked with the top ten on the ''Billboard'' 200, while their ninth album, ''[[Nowhere Generation]]'' (2021) failed to do the same. The band's tenth album, [[Ricochet (Rise Against album)|''Ricochet'']], released on August 15, 2025.

Rise Against is also known for their advocacy of [[progressivism]], supporting organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] and the [[It Gets Better Project]]. The band actively promotes [[animal rights]] and most of the members are [[straight edge]], [[PETA]] supporters and [[vegetarian]]s.

===Rising popularity (2004–2007)===
Rise Against's extensive touring schedule helped to establish an early fanbase, and attracted the attention of major record labels, including [[Dreamworks Records]].<ref name="Blistering Interview">{{cite web|last=Donnelly|first=Justin|url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/templateid/8696/menuid/3/tempidx/5/catid/4/restemp/N%3B/fPpagesel/1|title=Rise Against|work=[[Blistering (magazine)|Blistering]]|page=1|access-date=May 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120151954/http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/templateid/8696/menuid/3/tempidx/5/catid/4/restemp/N;/fPpagesel/1|archive-date=November 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="DreamWorks 2003">{{cite web|last=White|first=Adam|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/7057/rise-against-signs-to-dreamworks|title=Rise Against Signs To Dreamworks|publisher=Punknews.org|date=September 10, 2003|access-date=April 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005063131/https://www.punknews.org/article/7057/rise-against-signs-to-dreamworks|archive-date=October 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The general consensus among Fat Wreck Chords musicians was that major record labels sacrifice musical integrity in exchange for commercial profit.

===Lyrics===
Rise Against is known for their outspoken [[social commentary]], which often permeates their lyrics.<ref name="PopMatters Lyrics">{{cite web|last=Hauck|first=Kiel|url=https://www.popmatters.com/review/158465-a-day-to-remember-rise-against-5-may-2012-cincinnati-oh/|title=A Day to Remember + Rise Against 5 May 2012 - Cincinnati, OH|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=May 20, 2012|access-date=December 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124054338/http://www.popmatters.com/review/158465-a-day-to-remember-rise-against-5-may-2012-cincinnati-oh/|archive-date=January 24, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Throughout the years, the band has discussed a wide range of topics, including [[animal rights]], economic injustice, [[environmental disaster]]s, [[forced displacement]], [[homophobia]], and modern warfare.<ref name="AllMusic SAW Review"/><ref name="PopMatters Lyrics"/><ref name="Post Gazette Lyrics">{{cite web|last=Mervis|first=Scott|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music-reviews/2012/05/07/Rise-Against-deep-Marilyn-Manson-worn/stories/201205070153|title=Rise Against deep; Marilyn Manson worn|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=May 7, 2012|access-date=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Political corruption is another subject commonly found in their lyrics, and as a result, Rise Against is often labeled as a "political band".<ref name="Political Band">{{cite web|url=http://kroq.cbslocal.com/2012/05/29/rise-againsts-tim-mcilrath-we-got-into-punk-rock-because-we-were-the-black-sheep/|title=Rise Against's Tim McIlrath: 'We Got Into Punk Rock Because We Were The Black Sheep'|publisher=[[KROQ-FM]]|date=May 29, 2012|access-date=May 7, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170501092912/http://kroq.cbslocal.com/2012/05/29/rise-againsts-tim-mcilrath-we-got-into-punk-rock-because-we-were-the-black-sheep/|archive-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref> Some journalists have stated that the band has specifically targeted the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] administrations of [[Presidency of George W.

As the band's primary [[lyricist]], McIlrath is wary of the political label. "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that's where we get the tag '[[protest song|protest music]]' or 'political punk rock'".<ref name="Political Band"/> He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss these topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics.<ref name="Post-Gazette 2006">{{cite news|last=Mervis|first=Scott|title=Rise Against Rises To The Occasion|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=July 27, 2006|page=W-15|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania}}</ref> In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: "I think that a lot of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [our music] 10 years from now."<ref name="Post-Gazette 2006"/> Principe noted the band does not attempt to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rauschert|first=Jeff|title=Rise Against continues its 'Appeal to Reason' through live show|work=[[The Flint Journal]]|date=November 1, 2008|page=F11|url=http://www.mlive.com/entertainment/flint/index.ssf/2008/11/rise_against_continues_its_app.html}}</ref>

Not all Rise Against songs discuss controversial topics. More personal stories about broken relationships and forgiveness are common lyrical themes, as is the concept of self-reflection.<ref name="Post-Gazette 2006"/><ref name="Sun Times 2008">{{cite web|last=Derogatis|first=Jim|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/derogatis/2008/11/rise_against_melodic_hardcore.html|title=Rise Against: Melodic hardcore?

===Videography===
Rise Against will often produce an accompanying [[music video]] for a single. These videos typically either tell a narrative or feature documentary-like footage. This documentary style of filming can be seen in the music videos for "Ready to Fall", "Re-Education (Through Labor)", "[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]", and "I Don't Want to Be Here Anymore". These videos juxtapose footage of the band playing the song and footage of a certain societal issue such as gun violence or animal abuse, overlaid with damning facts about the issue.<ref name="Kerrang">{{cite web|last=Garner |first=George |title=The Ultimate Rise Against Videography |url=http://www.kerrang.com/24423/ultimate-rise-against-videography-by-tim-mcilrath/ |work=[[Kerrang!]] |date=February 15, 2015 |access-date=May 20, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120200652/http://www.kerrang.com/24423/ultimate-rise-against-videography-by-tim-mcilrath/ |archive-date=January 20, 2016 }}</ref> For example, the video "Ballad of Hollis Brown" is about the dangers of [[intensive farming|industrialized farming]] and [[poverty in the United States]], and features interviews with farmers who are struggling to stay afloat.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/rise-against-the-ballad-of-hollis-brown-20120113|title=Rise Against 'The Ballad of Hollis Brown'|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 13, 2012|access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>

Rise Against's narrative videos are also usually political in nature.<ref name="Kerrang"/> In the video for "Prayer of the Refugee" the band destroys products in a retail store, with intermittent shots of foreign workers making the store products. The goal was for the video to showcase how conventional business models allow for various [[human rights]] violations.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR8lrI_UmOM | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/wR8lrI_UmOM| archive-date=November 7, 2021 | url-status=live|title=Rise Against - Prayer Of The Refugee (Behind The Scenes) |publisher=Vevo |people=Petrossian, Tony (director) |medium=Behind the scenes video}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Some narrative videos follow the song's lyric thread, such as in the [[Hurricane Katrina]]–based video for "Help Is on the Way", while other videos are used to enforce the song's message, such as the band's anti-homophobic stance in the "Make It Stop (September's Children)" video.<ref name="Kerrang"/>

Discussing the "Ready to Fall" video and need for politicized music videos, McIlrath said: "We looked at it from the perspective of hijacking the airwaves. If they're gonna give us three and a half minutes of airtime on TV that means we can play anything, we can make a video that would be intense even on mute".<ref name="Kerrang"/> Rise Against has garnered some controversy for their music videos, particularly for perceived violent themes. The video for "Re-Education (Through Labor)" features the Chicago sect of the [[Moped Army]] planting and detonating bombs throughout the city. Some viewers saw this as an act of condoning terrorism.<ref name="Kerrang"/> The video for "The Violence", which was to feature the detonation of [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of the forty-three United States Presidents on a plot of farmland, was prohibited by the farm's board of directors for "anti-government themes".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Stutz|first=Colin|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/rise-against-video-shoot-permit-pulled-anti-american-7783506/|title=Rise Against Says 'The Violence' Video Shoot Permit Pulled Because It Was Deemed 'Anti-Government'|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 2, 2017|access-date=January 24, 2018}}</ref>
