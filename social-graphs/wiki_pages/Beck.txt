'''Beck David Hansen''' (born '''Bek <!-- His birth name is Bek, see the sources given. This is not a typo and should not be changed without good reason.-->David Campbell'''; July 8, 1970), known [[mononym]]ously as '''Beck''', is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He rose to fame in the early 1990s with his [[Experimental music|experimental]] and [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] style, and became known for creating musical collages of wide-ranging genres. He has musically encompassed [[Folk music|folk]], [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Electronic music|electronica]], [[alternative rock]], [[Country music|country]], and [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]]. He has released 14 studio albums (three of which were released on indie labels), as well as several non-album singles and a book of sheet music.

Born and raised in [[Los Angeles]], Beck gravitated towards hip hop and folk in his teens and began to perform locally at coffeehouses and clubs. He moved to [[New York City]] in 1989 and became involved in the city's [[anti-folk]] movement. Returning to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, he saw his commercial breakthrough with his 1993 single "[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]]." After signing with [[DGC Records]], the song peaked at number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and served as lead single for his third album and [[major label]] debut, ''[[Mellow Gold]]'' (1994). Its follow-up, ''[[Odelay]]'' (1996), topped critic polls and won several awards. He released the country-influenced, twangy ''[[Mutations (Beck album)|Mutations]]'' in 1998, and the funk-infused ''[[Midnite Vultures]]'' in 1999. The soft-acoustic ''[[Sea Change (album)|Sea Change]]'' in 2002 showcased a more serious Beck, and 2005's ''[[Guero]]'' returned to ''Odelay''{{'}}s [[sample (music)|sample]]-based production. ''[[The Information (Beck album)|The Information]]'' in 2006 was inspired by electro-funk, hip hop, and psychedelia; 2008's ''[[Modern Guilt]]'' was inspired by 1960s pop; and 2014's folk-infused ''[[Morning Phase]]'' won [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[57th Grammy Awards]]. His 2017 album, ''[[Colors (Beck album)|Colors]]'', won awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-classical at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]]. His fourteenth studio album, ''[[Hyperspace (album)|Hyperspace]]'', was released on November 22, 2019. In 2022, Beck was nominated for the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]].

With a [[pop art]] collage of musical styles, oblique and [[irony|ironic]] lyrics, and [[postmodern]] arrangements incorporating [[sample (music)|samples]], [[drum machine]]s, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics and the public throughout his musical career as being among the most idiosyncratically creative musicians of 1990s and 2000s [[alternative rock]]. Two of Beck's most popular and acclaimed recordings are ''Odelay'' and ''Sea Change'', both of which were ranked on ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]]. Beck is a four-time [[RIAA certification|platinum]] artist; he has collaborated with several artists and has made several contributions to soundtracks.

Beck was born in a rooming house near downtown Los Angeles. As a child he lived in a declining neighborhood near [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref name="rs97"/> He remembers "By the time we left there, they were ripping out miles of houses en masse and building low-rent, giant apartment blocks."<ref name="q97"/> The working-class family struggled financially, moving to Hoover and Ninth Street, a neighborhood populated primarily by Koreans and Salvadorian refugees.<ref name="q97"/> He was sent for a time to live with his paternal grandparents in [[Kansas]]; he later remarked that he thought "they were kind of concerned" about his "weird" home life.<ref name=rs94>{{cite news| url =https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/meet-beck-the-unlikely-success-story-of-a-hip-hop-folk-rocker-19940421| title =Meet Beck: The Unlikely Success Story of a Hip-Hop Folk Rocker| work =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| date =April 21, 1994| access-date =July 11, 2013| author =Wild, David| issue =680| pages =79–80| publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]| location =New York City| issn =0035-791X| archive-date =August 6, 2013| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130806003751/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/meet-beck-the-unlikely-success-story-of-a-hip-hop-folk-rocker-19940421| url-status =live}}</ref> Because his paternal grandfather was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister, Beck grew up influenced by church music and hymns.<ref name="rs94"/> He also spent time in [[Europe]] with his maternal grandfather.<ref name="rsencyclopedia"/>

After his parents separated when he was 10,<ref name="q97"/> Beck stayed with his mother and brother Channing in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by the city's diverse musical offerings—everything from [[hip hop music|hip hop]] to [[Latin American music|Latin music]] and his mother's art scene—all of which would later reappear in his work.<ref name= :"ny">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/02/beck-is-home|title=Beck Is Home|last=Petrusich|first=Amanda|magazine=The New Yorker|date=November 25, 2019|access-date=November 29, 2019|language=en|issn=0028-792X|archive-date=November 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191129082832/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/02/beck-is-home|url-status=live}}</ref> Beck obtained his first guitar at 16 and became a street musician, often playing [[Lead Belly]] covers at [[Lafayette Park, Los Angeles|Lafayette Park]].<ref name="rs96"/> During his teens, Beck discovered the music of [[Sonic Youth]], [[Pussy Galore (band)|Pussy Galore]], and [[X (American band)|X]], but remained uninterested in most music outside the folk genre until many years into his career.<ref name="rsencyclopedia"/><ref name="q97"/> The first contemporary music that made a direct connection with Beck was hip hop, which he first heard on [[Grandmaster Flash]] records in the early 1980s.<ref name="q97"/> Growing up in a predominantly Latin district, he found himself the only white child at his school, and quickly learned how to [[breakdance]].<ref name="q97"/> When he was 17, Beck grew fascinated after hearing a [[Mississippi John Hurt]] record at a friend's house,<ref name="lat94"/> and spent hours in his room trying to emulate Hurt's [[Fingerstyle guitar|finger-picking]] techniques.<ref name="rs94"/> Shortly thereafter Beck explored blues and folk music further, discovering [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Blind Willie Johnson]].<ref name="lat94"/>

Feeling like "a total outcast", Beck dropped out of school after junior high.<ref name="lat94"/> He later said that although he felt school was important, he felt unsafe there.<ref name="rs97"/> When he applied to the new [[performing arts]] high school downtown, he was rejected.<ref name=nym12>{{cite news| url=https://www.vulture.com/2012/12/beck-hansens-song-reader.html| title=Listening to Beck: The Artist on His New Album, Which Isn't Really an Album At All| work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]| date=December 23, 2012| access-date=July 11, 2013| author=Lee, Dan P.| publisher=New York Media, LLC| location=New York City| issn=0028-7369| archive-date=May 30, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530032432/http://www.vulture.com/2012/12/beck-hansens-song-reader.html| url-status=live}}</ref> His brother took him to post-[[Beat Generation|Beat]] jazz places in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] and [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]].

He used a [[Identity fraud|fake ID]] to sit in on classes there, and he also befriended a literature instructor and his poet wife.<ref name="nym12"/> He worked at a string of odd jobs, including loading trucks and operating a [[leaf blower]].<ref name="lat94"/>

==Career==
===Early performances and first releases (1988–1993)===
Beck began as a [[Folk music|folk]] musician, switching between [[country blues]], [[Delta blues]], and more traditional rural folk music in his teenage years.<ref name=q97>{{cite news| last=Cavanagh| first=David| title=The Devil Inside |work=[[Q magazine|Q]]| date=July 1997| pages =92–99| publisher =[[Bauer Media Group]]| location =London }}</ref> He began performing on city buses, often covering Mississippi John Hurt alongside original, sometimes improvisational compositions.<ref name="rs94"/> "I'd get on the bus and start playing Mississippi John Hurt with totally improvised lyrics. Some drunk would start yelling at me, calling me [[Axl Rose]]. So I'd start singing about Axl Rose and the levee and bus passes and strychnine, mixing the whole thing up", he later recalled.<ref name="rs94"/> He was also in a band called Youthless that hosted [[Dada]]ist-inspired freeform events at city coffee shops.<ref name="q97"/> "We had [[Radio Shack]] mics and this homemade speaker and we'd draft people in the audience to recite comic books or do a [[beatbox]] thing, or we'd tie the whole audience up in masking tape," Beck recalled.<ref name="q97"/>

In 1989, Beck caught a bus to New York City with little more than $8.00 and a guitar.<ref name="rs94"/> He spent the summer attempting to find a job and a place to live with little success.<ref name="rs94"/> Beck eventually began to frequent [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]] and stumbled upon the tail end of the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]'s [[anti-folk]] scene's first wave.<ref name="rsencyclopedia"/> Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians—including [[Cindy Lee Berryhill]], [[Kirk Kelly]], [[Paleface (musician)|Paleface]], and [[Lach (musician)|Lach]] headed by [[Roger Manning]]—whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream.<ref name="lat94"/><ref name="gp94"/> "The whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones," said Beck of his New York years. "Everybody knew each other. You could go up onstage and say anything, and you wouldn't feel weird or feel any pressure."<ref name="gp94"/> Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, [[surrealism|surrealistic]] songs about pizza, [[MTV]], and working at [[McDonald's]], turning mundane thoughts into songs.<ref name=gp94>{{cite news| last=Rotondi| first=James| title=Beck & Roger Manning: "Set Your Guitars and Banjos on Fire" |work=[[Guitar Player]]| date=September 1994|volume=28| issue =9| pages =113–116| publisher =[[New Bay Media]]| location =[[San Bruno, California|San Bruno]] | issn = 0017-5463}}</ref> Beck was roommates with [[Paleface (musician)|Paleface]], sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together.<ref>Leibovitz, Annie.

"It was hard to be in New York with no money, no place ... I kinda used up all the friends I had. Everyone on the scene got sick of me."<ref name="rs94"/>

Back in Los Angeles, Beck began to work at a [[Video rental shop|video store]] in the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] neighborhood, "doing things like alphabetizing the pornography section".<ref name="rs94"/> He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and [[Raji's]].<ref name="rsencyclopedia"/><ref name="rs94"/><ref name="lat94"/> In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner.<ref>Palacios 2000, p. 71</ref> "I'd be banging away on a [[Son House]] tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening," he later remarked.<ref name=ew97>{{Cite magazine| last=Browne| first=David| author-link=David Browne (journalist)| title=Beck in the High Life| magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| issue =366| pages =32–35| date=February 14, 1997| publisher =[[Time Inc.]]| location =New York City | issn = 1049-0434}}</ref> Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play "strange folk songs", accompanied by "what could best be described as [[performance art]]" while sometimes wearing a ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] mask.<ref name=lat94>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-02-20-ca-25047-story.html| title=Don't Get Bitter on Us, Beck| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=February 20, 1994| access-date=July 11, 2013| author=Hochman, Steve| location=Los Angeles| issn=0458-3035| archive-date=October 29, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200830/http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-20/entertainment/ca-25047_1_folk-songs| url-status=live}}</ref> Beck met someone who offered to help record [[Demo (music)|demos]] in his living room, and he began to pass [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] around.<ref name="lat94"/>

Eventually, Beck gained key boosters in Margaret Mittleman, the West Coast's director of talent acquisitions for [[BMG Music Publishing]], and the partners behind [[independent record label]] [[Bong Load Custom Records]]: [[Tom Rothrock]], [[Rob Schnapf]], and Brad Lambert.<ref name="rsencyclopedia"/> Schnapf saw Beck perform at Jabberjaw and felt he would suit their small venture.<ref name="lat94"/> Beck expressed a loose interest in [[hip hop]] and Rothrock introduced him to Carl Stephenson, a record producer for [[Rap-A-Lot Records]].<ref name="lat94"/><ref>Palacios 2000, p. 72</ref> In 1992, Beck visited Stephenson's home to collaborate with him. The result—the [[slide guitar|slide]]-[[sampling (music)|sampling]] hip hop track "[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]]"—was a one-off experiment that Beck set aside, going back to his folk songs, making his home tapes such as ''[[Golden Feelings]]'', and releasing several independent singles.<ref name="lat94"/>

===''Mellow Gold'', and independent albums (1993–1994)===
By 1993, Beck was living in a rat-infested shed near a Los Angeles alleyway with little money.<ref name="rs94"/> Bong Load issued "Loser" as a single in March 1993 on 12" vinyl with only 500 copies pressed.<ref name = "Palacios 77">Palacios 2000, p. 77</ref> Beck felt that "Loser" was mediocre, and only agreed to its release at Rothrock's insistence.<ref>Palacios 2000, p. 74</ref> "Loser" unexpectedly received radio airplay, starting in Los Angeles, where [[Campus radio|college radio]] station [[KXLU]] was the first to play it,<ref>{{cite news |last=Hart |first=Ron |date=March 4, 2019 |title=Beck Producer Tom Rothrock Looks Back on 'Mellow Gold' & Its Unlikely Road to Success |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/beck-producer-tom-rothrock-mellow-gold-loser-8500851/ |magazine= Billboard|location=NYC |access-date=December 21, 2020}}</ref><ref name = "Palacios 77" /> and later on [[Santa Monica College]] radio station [[KCRW]], where radio host [[Chris Douridas]] played the song on ''[[Morning Becomes Eclectic]]'', the station's flagship music program. "I called the record label that day and asked to have Beck play live on the air", Douridas said. "He came in that Friday, rapped to a tape of 'Loser' and did his song 'MTV Makes Me Want to Smoke Crack.{{'"}}<ref name="lat94"/> That night, Beck performed at the Los Angeles club Cafe Troy to a packed audience and talent scouts from major labels.<ref name="lat94"/> The song then spread to Seattle through [[KNDD]] The End, and [[KROQ-FM]] began playing the song on an almost hourly basis.<ref name = "Palacios 77" /> As Bong Load struggled to press more copies of "Loser", Beck was beset with offers to sign with major labels.<ref name="Palacios 80">Palacios 2000, p. 80</ref> During the bidding war in November, Beck spent several days in [[Olympia, Washington]], recording material with [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]] of [[Beat Happening]], which would later see release the following year on Johnson's [[K Records]] as ''[[One Foot in the Grave (album)|One Foot in the Grave]]''.<ref name="bb93"/>

A fierce bidding war ensued, with [[Geffen Records]] A&R director Mark Kates signing Beck in December 1993 amid intense competition from [[Warner Bros.

I mean, I ''never'' had any slack. I was working a $4-an-hour job trying to stay alive. That slacker stuff is for people who have the time to be depressed about everything."<ref name="rs94"/>

===Backlash and ''Odelay'' (1994–1997)===

During one busy week in January 1997, he landed his Grammy nominations, appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[Howard Stern (E! show)|Howard Stern]]'', and did a last-minute trot on ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]''. The combined buzz gave ''Odelay'' a second wind, leading to an expanded fan base and additional exposure<ref name="ew97"/> Beck enjoyed but, like several executives at Geffen, was bewildered by the success of ''Odelay''. He would often get recognized in public, which made him feel strange. "It's just weird. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel natural to me. I don't think I was made for that. I was never good at that," he later told [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]].<ref name="p4k11"/> ''Odelay'' sold two million copies and put "one-hit wonder" criticisms to rest.

''[[Midnite Vultures]]'', Beck's next studio effort, was originally recorded as a double album, and more than 25 nearly completed songs were left behind.<ref name="p4k11"/> In the studio, Beck and producers studied contemporary hip hop and R&B, specifically [[R.

Following the release of ''Sea Change'', Beck felt newer compositions were sketches for something more evolved in the same direction, and wrote nearly 35 more songs in the coming months, keeping demos of them on tapes in a suitcase.<ref name="p4k11"/> During his solo tour, the tapes were left backstage during a stop in Washington, D.C., and Beck was never able to recover them.

As a result, Beck took a break and wrote no original compositions in 2003.<ref name="p4k11"/> Feeling as though it might take him a while to "get back to that [songwriting] territory", he entered the studio with Dust Brothers to complete a project that dated back to ''Odelay''.

In 2007, Beck released the single "[[Timebomb (Beck song)|Timebomb]]", which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance.<ref name="nyt08"/> For his next studio effort, his tenth, Beck tapped [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]] to produce, and the two first met in December 2007 to record.
