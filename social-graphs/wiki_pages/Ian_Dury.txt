'''Ian Robins Dury''' (12 May 1942{{snd}} 27 March 2000) was an English singer, songwriter and actor who rose to fame in the late 1970s, during the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] era of [[rock music]]. He was the lead singer and lyricist of [[Kilburn and the High Roads]], the Kilburns, [[The Blockheads|Ian Dury and the Blockheads]] and Ian Dury and the Music Students.

==Early life and education==
Ian Dury was born at 43 Weald Rise in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], at that time in [[Middlesex]].<ref name="odnb" /> His early years were spent in [[Harrow Weald]] (although it is often misreported that he was born in [[Upminster]], [[Essex]], an impression he often encouraged) and in [[Mevagissey]], [[Cornwall]], during the [[Blitzkrieg|Blitz]].<ref>{{cite book | first= Richard | last= Balls | year= 2000 | title= Sex & Drugs & Rock'N'Roll: The Life of Ian Dury | edition= 1st | publisher=Omnibus Press | location= London | pages= 14–16 | isbn= 0-7119-8644-4 }}</ref> His father, William George Dury (born 23 September 1905 in [[Southborough, Kent|Southborough]], Kent, died 25 February 1968 in Victoria, London), was a former boxer, coach and bus driver, and [[chauffeur]] for [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]].

Bill Dury was absent for work for long periods, so Peggy often took Ian to stay with her parents in Mevagissey. After the [[Second World War]], the family moved briefly to Switzerland, where Ian's father was chauffeuring for a millionaire and the [[Western European Union]]. In 1946, Peggy brought Ian back to England and they relocated to [[Cranham]],<ref name="auto">Balls, Richard (2000), pp. 16–24</ref> near Upminster in Essex, to live with Peggy's sisters. Although he saw his father on visits, they were never to live together again.<ref name="auto"/>
At age seven, Dury contracted [[polio]], most likely, he believed, at Westcliff Swimming Pool in [[Southend-on-Sea]] during the [[History of poliomyelitis#Epidemics|1949 polio epidemic]]. After six weeks of isolation in the [[Royal Cornwall Infirmary]], [[Truro]], Ian was moved by ambulance back to Essex, to [[Black Notley]] Hospital in [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]], where he spent eighteen months regaining his strength and mobility. Polio caused paralysis on the left-hand side of his body which led to a permanent disability.

Ian attended [[Chailey Heritage School|Chailey Heritage Craft School]], East Sussex, from 1951 till 1954. Chailey was a hospital school for disabled children that had an ethos of toughening up its students, often by leaving the less physically able to find their own way up off the floor. Arguably, this harsh approach contributed to the tough and determined person Dury became.<ref>Balls, Richard (2000) pp. 30–35</ref> Chailey taught trades such as [[cobbling]] and printing, but Dury's mother wanted him to focus on academic studies, so Aunt Moll (Mary Walker), a Buckinghamshire Education Officer, arranged for him to attend the [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe]]. Ian found this school a challenge and recounted being punished for misdemeanours by being forced by prefects to learn long tracts of poetry until a housemaster found him sobbing and put a stop to it:
{{blockquote|I had to go into a box room where the suitcases were stored and learn 80 lines of ''[[To Autumn|Ode to Autumn]]'' by yer man [[John Keats|Keats]].

==Art career==

In 1967 Dury took part in a group exhibition, "Fantasy and Figuration", alongside Elizabeth Rathmell, [[Pat Douthwaite]], Herbert Kitchen and [[Stass Paraskos]] at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London.<ref name=ica>ICA, ''Fantasy and Figuration,'' exhibition cat., London, 1967, Tate Archive (London) ref. LON-INS (S.C.)</ref>

Between 1966 and 1973 he was an art teacher at [[Luton College of Technology]] and at [[Kent Institute of Art & Design|Canterbury College of Art]].<ref>{{cite web |date=2012 |title=Ian Dury CV |url=https://iandury.co.uk/cv/ |website=IanDury.co.uk |access-date=July 11, 2025}}</ref><ref name=iandury/> He also painted commercial illustrations for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in the early 1970s.<ref>Birch, W.

==Music career==
===Kilburn and the High Roads (1971–1975)===
Dury formed [[Kilburn and the High Roads]] (a reference to [[Kilburn High Road|the road in North West London]]) in 1971,<ref>{{cite book |first1=Harris M. |last1=Berger |first2=Michael Thomas |last2=Carroll |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhYxPacpJTEC&q=Kilburn+%26+the+High+Roads&pg=PA223 |title=Global pop, local language |page=223 |publisher=Univ.

Managed first by [[Charlie Gillett]]<ref name="life"/> and Gordon Nelki and latterly by fashion entrepreneur [[Tommy Roberts Mr Freedom|Tommy Roberts]], the Kilburns were popular on London's [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] circuit and signed to Dawn Records in 1974 but, despite favourable press coverage and a tour opening for English rock band [[The Who]], the group failed to rise above cult status and disbanded in 1975.{{cn|date=March 2025}}

Kilburn and the High Roads recorded two albums, ''[[Handsome (Kilburn and the High-Roads album)|Handsome]]'' and ''[[Wotabunch!]]''.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r42250}}</ref>

===Going solo (August – September 1977)===

The single "[[Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll]]", released 26 August 1977, marked Dury's [[Stiff Records]] debut. Although it was banned by the [[BBC]], it was named Single of the Week by ''[[NME]]'' on its release.<ref name="pennyblack">{{cite web |url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/Article/4896/Blockheads-Interview |first=John |last=Clarkson |title=Mickey Gallagher interview, October 2008 |publisher=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk |date=28 October 2008 |access-date=12 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612152249/http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/Article/4896/Blockheads-Interview |url-status=live }}</ref> The single issue was soon followed, at the end of September, by the album ''[[New Boots and Panties!!]]'' which achieved platinum status. "Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll" was not listed on the album's track list, yet it was nonetheless present as track 1 on side 2 of some later 1977 pressings).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hifinews.com/content/ian-dury-new-boots-panties-alternate-format-discography | title=Ian Dury: New Boots & Panties!!

===The Blockheads===

{{refimprove section|date=March 2025}}
{{main|The Blockheads}}
[[File:Ian Dury 2.jpg|thumb|right|Live at [[The Roundhouse]], [[Chalk Farm]], London, 1978]]
Under the management of [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andrew King]] and [[Peter Jenner]], the original managers of [[Pink Floyd]], Ian Dury and the Blockheads quickly gained a reputation as one of the top live acts of [[new wave music]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ian Dury and the Blockheads's 1978 Concert & Tour History {{!}} Concert Archives |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/ian-dury-and-the-blockheads |access-date=2025-06-13 |website=www.concertarchives.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Live At Rockpalast - Record Collector Magazine |url=https://recordcollectormag.com/reviews/dvd/live-at-rockpalast-2 |access-date=2025-06-13 |language=en}}</ref>

The Blockheads' sound drew from its members' diverse musical influences, which included [[jazz]], rock and roll, [[funk]], and [[reggae]], and Dury's love of [[music hall]]. The band was formed after Dury began writing songs with pianist and guitarist [[Chas Jankel|Chaz Jankel]] (the brother of music video, TV, commercial and film director [[Annabel Jankel]]). Jankel took Dury's lyrics, fashioned a number of songs, and they began recording with members of [[Radio Caroline]]'s Loving Awareness Band{{snd}} drummer [[Charley Charles]] (born Hugh Glenn Mortimer Charles, [[Guyana]] 1945), bassist [[Norman Watt-Roy]], keyboard player [[Mick Gallagher]], guitarist [[John Turnbull (musician)|John Turnbull]] and former Kilburns saxophonist [[Davey Payne]].{{cn|date=April 2023}}
[[File:duryegg.jpg|thumb|upright|Live at The Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, London, 1978]]
In October 1977 Dury and his band started performing as Ian Dury and the Blockheads, when the band signed on for the Stiff "Live Stiffs Tour" alongside [[Elvis Costello]] & [[the Attractions]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Wreckless Eric]], and [[Larry Wallis]]. The tour was a success, and Stiff launched a concerted Ian Dury marketing campaign, resulting in the Top Ten hit "[[What a Waste]]" and the hit single "[[Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick]]", which reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK at the beginning of 1979, selling just short of a million copies. Again, "Hit Me" was not included on the original release of the subsequent album ''[[Do It Yourself (Ian Dury & the Blockheads album)|Do It Yourself]]''. With their hit singles, the band built up a dedicated following in the UK and other countries and their next single "[[Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3]]" made number three in the UK.
The band's second album ''Do It Yourself'' was released in June 1979 in a [[Barney Bubbles]]-designed sleeve of which there were over a dozen variations, all based on samples from the [[Crown Wallpaper|Crown wallpaper]] catalogue. Bubbles also designed the Blockhead logo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aural-innovations.com/robertcalvert/hawkwind/barney.htm |first=Roy |last=Carr |newspaper=[[New Musical Express]] |title=Barney Bubbles obituary |access-date=12 June 2018 |date=26 November 1983 |archive-date=5 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805175232/http://www.aural-innovations.com/robertcalvert/hawkwind/barney.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Jankel left the band temporarily and relocated to the US after the release of "What a Waste" (his organ part on that single was overdubbed later) but he subsequently returned to the UK and began touring sporadically with the Blockheads, eventually returning to the group full-time for the recording of "Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick"; according to Mickey Gallagher, the band recorded 28 takes of the song but eventually settled on the second take for the single release. Partly due to personality clashes with Dury,<ref name="pennyblack"/> Jankel left the group again in 1980, after the recording of the ''Do It Yourself'' LP, and he returned to the US to concentrate on his solo career.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Barlass |first=John |date=2020-12-05 |title=Chaz Jankel - Glad To Know You - The Anthology 1980-1986: Album Review |url=https://atthebarrier.com/2020/12/05/chaz-jankel-glad-to-know-you-the-anthology-1980-1986-album-review/ |access-date=2025-06-13 |website=At The Barrier |language=en-GB}}</ref>

The group worked solidly over the 18 months between the release of "Rhythm Stick" and their next single, "Reasons to Be Cheerful, Part 3", which returned them to the charts, making the UK Top 10. Jankel was replaced by former [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] guitarist [[Wilko Johnson]], who also contributed to the next album ''[[Laughter (Ian Dury & The Blockheads album)|Laughter]]'' (1980) and its two hit singles, although Gallagher recalls that the recording of the ''Laughter'' album was difficult and that Dury was drinking heavily in this period.<ref name="pennyblack"/>

In 1980–81 Dury and Jankel teamed up again with [[Sly and Robbie]] and the [[Compass Point All Stars]] to record ''[[Lord Upminster]]'' (1981). The Blockheads toured the UK and Europe throughout 1981, sometimes augmented by jazz trumpeter [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], ending the year with their only tour of Australia.<ref name="Blockheads official website">{{cite web |url=http://www.theblockheads.com/biog.php |title=Blockheads official website |publisher=Theblockheads.com |access-date=30 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509084204/http://www.theblockheads.com/biog.php |archive-date=9 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
The Blockheads disbanded in early 1982, after Dury secured a new recording deal with [[Polydor Records]] through A&R man Frank Neilson. Choosing to work with a group of young musicians which he named the Music Students, he recorded the album ''Four Thousand Weeks' Holiday''. This album marked a departure from his usual style and was not as well received by fans for its American jazz influence.{{cn|date=April 2023}}

The Blockheads briefly reformed in June 1987 to play a short tour of Japan, and then disbanded again. In September 1990, following the death from cancer of drummer Charley Charles, they reunited for two benefit concerts in aid of Charles' family, held at [[The Forum, London|The Forum]], [[Camden Town]], with [[Steven Monti]] on drums. In December 1990, augmented by Merlin Rhys-Jones on guitar and Will Parnell on percussion, they recorded the live album ''Warts & Audience'' at the [[Brixton Academy]].<ref name="Blockheads official website"/>

The Blockheads (minus Jankel, who returned to California) toured Spain in January 1991, then disbanded again until August 1992 when, following Jankel's return to England, they were invited to reform for the [[Madstock!]] Festival in [[Finsbury Park]];<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/ian-dury-and-the-blockheads/1992/finsbury-park-london-england-13ddf5d9.html |title=Ian Dury & The Blockheads Setlist |publisher=Setlist.fm |access-date=18 June 2018 |archive-date=19 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619140124/https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/ian-dury-and-the-blockheads/1992/finsbury-park-london-england-13ddf5d9.html |url-status=live }}</ref> this was followed by sporadic gigs in Europe, Ireland, the UK and Japan in late 1994 and 1995.<ref name="Blockheads official website"/> In the early 1990s, Dury appeared with English band [[Curve (band)|Curve]] on the benefit compilation album ''[[Peace Together]]''. Dury and Curve singer [[Toni Halliday]] shared vocals on a cover of the Blockheads' track "What a Waste".{{cn|date=April 2023}}

In March 1996 Dury was diagnosed with cancer and, after recovering from an operation, he set about writing another album. In late 1996 he reunited with the Blockheads to record the album ''[[Mr. Love Pants]]'' (1997). Ian Dury and the Blockheads resumed touring, with Dylan Howe replacing Steven Monti on drums. Davey Payne left the group permanently in August and was replaced by [[Gilad Atzmon]]; this line-up gigged throughout 1999, culminating in their last performance with Ian Dury on 6 February 2000 at the [[London Palladium]]. Dury died six weeks later on 27 March 2000.<ref name="Blockheads official website"/>

The Blockheads have continued after Dury's death, and continue to play live gigs {{as of|lc=yes|2023}}.<ref>{{cite web | title=Live gigs | website=The Blockheads | url=https://www.theblockheads.com/live-gigs/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230318001226/https://www.theblockheads.com/live-gigs/ | archive-date=18 March 2023 | url-status=live | access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref>

===Other solo work===

Dury continued to record other work without the Blockheads, including ''[[Lord Upminster]]'' (1981); ''[[Apples (album)|Apples]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Bus Driver's Prayer & Other Stories]]'' (1992). He also released a single album with the Music Students, ''[[4,000 Weeks' Holiday]]'' (1984).
His 1981 song "[[Spasticus Autisticus]]"{{snd}} written to show his disdain for that year's [[International Year of Disabled Persons]], which he saw as patronising and counter-productive{{snd}} was banned by the [[BBC]] from being broadcast by the BBC before 6 pm. The lyrics were uncompromising:

<poem>
    So place your hard-earned peanuts in my tin
    And thank the Creator you're not in the state I'm in
    So long have I been languished on the shelf
    I must give all proceedings to myself</poem>
The song's refrain, "I'm spasticus, autisticus", was inspired by the response of the rebellious Roman [[gladiator]]s in the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', who, when instructed to identify their leader, all answered, "I am [[Spartacus]]", to protect him. According to George McKay, in his 2009 article "Crippled with nerves" (an early Dury song title), for ''Popular Music'':<ref>{{cite journal |first=George |last=McKay |date=2009 |url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2372/1/displayFulltext.pdf |title='Crippled with nerves': popular music and polio, with particular reference to Ian Dury |journal=Popular Music |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=341–365 |doi=10.1017/S0261143009990109 |s2cid=161590800 |access-date=12 June 2018 |archive-date=16 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916101509/http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2372/1/displayFulltext.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>
{{blockquote|Ian Dury, that 'flaw of the jungle', produced a remarkable and sustained body of work that explored issues of disability, in both personal and social contexts, institutionalisation, and to a lesser extent the pop cultural tradition of disability. He also, with the single "Spasticus Autisticus" (1981), produced one of the outstanding protest songs about the place of disabled people in what he called 'normal land'.}}

Dury described the song as "a war cry" on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''.{{cn|date=April 2023}} The song was used at the opening of the [[London 2012 Paralympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://disabilityarts.online/magazine/opinion/london-2012-paralympic-games-lost-legacy/ |title=The London 2012 Paralympic Games – A Lost Legacy? |date=26 August 2016 |author=Graeae |publisher=Disability Arts Online |access-date=26 April 2022}}</ref>
In 1984, Dury was featured in the music video for the minor hit single "[[Walking in My Sleep]]" by [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[The Who]].{{cn|date=April 2023}}

==Musical influences and style==

Dury's self-styling and chief musical influence was his hero since childhood, American [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]] artist [[Gene Vincent]]. After hearing Vincent's hit single "[[Be-Bop-a-Lula]]" in the 1956 musical comedy film  ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'', he idolised him. Vincent also wore a [[leg brace]], although Dury said he did not know this until later. Vincent is mentioned in one of Dury's earliest songs, "Upminster Kid"<ref name=starkey2022>{{cite web | last=Starkey | first=Arun | title=Exploring the influence of Gene Vincent on Ian Dury | website=Far Out Magazine | date=12 October 2022 | url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/the-influence-of-gene-vincent-on-ian-dury/ | access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref> (on the 1975 Kilburn and the High Roads album ''[[Handsome (Kilburn and the High-Roads album)|Handsome]]''<ref>{{cite web | last=Erlewine | first=Stephen Thomas | title=Kilburn & the High Roads - Handsome Album Reviews, Songs & More | website=AllMusic | date=31 December 1969 | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/handsome-mw0000595977 | access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref>),<ref>{{cite web | title=Song of the Day: Music About Other Artists (Day Five).

Vincent had died four years earlier.<ref name=starkey2022/>

More well-known is the single "[[Sweet Gene Vincent]]" from his first solo album, ''[[New Boots and Panties!!]]'' in 1977. He wrote the lyrics after spending six weeks of research on Vincent, which included reading two biographies. His songwriting partner Chas Jankel had to trim it considerably, after Dury's original version, Jankel joked, "would have taken around 15 minutes to perform". The opening lyrics to the song were:<ref name=starkey2022/>{{blockquote|Blue Gene baby / Skinny white sailor, the chances were slender / The beauties were brief / Shall I mourn your decline with some Thunderbird wine / And a black handkerchief? / I miss your sad Virginia whisper / I miss the voice that called my heart.}}

Dury was a lover of [[music hall]], another of his heroes being [[Max Wall]]. Dury developed a unique style that mixed music hall with punk and rock and roll, and crafted an on-stage [[persona]] that entertained his audiences.<ref name=it2000>{{cite news | title=Mixing music hall with rock and roll | newspaper=The Irish Times | date=1 April 2000 | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/mixing-music-hall-with-rock-and-roll-1.262260 | access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref>

Dury's lyrics are a combination of lyrical poetry, [[word play]], observation of British everyday life, character sketches, and sexual humour: "This is what we find&nbsp;... Home improvement expert Harold Hill of Harold Hill, Of do-it-yourself dexterity and double-glazing skill, Came home to find another gentleman's kippers in the grill, So he sanded off his winkle with his Black & Decker drill".{{cn|date=April 2023}} The song "[[Billericay Dickie]]" rhymes "I had a love affair with Nina, In the back of my [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]]" with "A seasoned-up hyena Could not have been more obscener".<ref name=it2000/>

==Acting and other activities==
[[File:Ian Dury2.jpg|thumb|upright|Dury in concert]]
Dury's confident and unusual demeanour caught the eyes of producers and directors of drama. His first important and extensive role was in [[Farrukh Dhondy]]'s mini-series for the BBC ''[[King of the Ghetto]]'' (1986), a drama set in London's multi-racial [[Brick Lane]] area with a cast led by a young [[Tim Roth]].<ref>{{Citation |title=King of the Ghetto |date=1986-05-01 |type=Drama |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316994/ |access-date=2025-01-27 |others=Tim Roth, Zia Mohyeddin, Gwyneth Strong |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)}}</ref>

Dury had small parts in several films, probably the best known of which was [[Peter Greenaway]]'s ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]'' (1989), as well as a [[cameo role|cameo appearance]] in [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Pirates (1986 film)|Pirates]]'' (1986). He also appeared in the [[Eduardo Guedes]] film '' Rocinante'' (1986), the German comedy (lead) ''Brennende Betten'' (Burning Beds) (1988), [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s ''[[The Rainbow Thief]]'' (1990), and the [[Sylvester Stallone]] science fiction film ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' (1995). His other film appearances included roles in ''Number One'' (1985) starring [[Bob Geldof]], the [[Bob Hoskins]] film ''[[The Raggedy Rawney]]'' (1988), and ''[[Split Second (1992 film)|Split Second]]'' (1992) starring [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Kim Cattrall]]. He also appeared alongside fellow lyricists [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Tom Waits]], respectively, in the movies ''[[Hearts of Fire]]'' (1987) and ''Bearskin: An Urban Fairytale'' (1990), also by Eduardo Guedes.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Willemen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/17/guardianobituaries.filmnews1 |title=Obituary: Eduardo Guedes |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 October 2000 |access-date=12 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612145118/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/17/guardianobituaries.filmnews1 |url-status=live }}</ref> His later films included the comedy ''[[Different for Girls (film)|Different for Girls]]'' (1996), and ''[[The Crow: City of Angels]]'' (1996), directed by [[Tim Pope]], who had directed a few of Dury's music videos.{{cn|date=April 2023}}

Dury also wrote a musical, ''Apples'', staged in London's [[Royal Court Theatre]]. In 1987 he appeared as the narrator (Scullery) in ''[[Road (play)|Road]]'', also at the Royal Court. Among the cast was actress and singer [[Jane Horrocks]], who cohabited with Dury until late in 1988, although the relationship was kept discreet.<ref>Balls, Richard (2000), pp. 264–6</ref>

Dury wrote and performed the theme song "Profoundly in Love with Pandora" for the television series ''[[The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾]]'' (1985), based on the book of the same name by [[Sue Townsend]], as well as its follow-up, ''[[The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole]]'' (1987). Dury turned down an offer from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] to write the libretto for ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' (from which [[Richard Stilgoe]] reportedly earned millions). The reason, said Dury, "I can't stand his music."<ref name="G270300">{{cite news |author=Denselow, Robin |author-link=Robin Denselow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/27/guardianobituaries.robindenselow |title=Ian Dury obituary |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 March 2000 |access-date=12 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141911/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/27/guardianobituaries.robindenselow |url-status=live }}</ref>

When [[HIV/AIDS]] first came to prominence in the mid-1980s, Dury was among celebrities who appeared on UK television to promote [[safe sex]], demonstrating how to put on a [[condom]] using a model of an erect penis. In the 1990s, he became an ambassador for [[UNICEF]], recruiting stars such as [[Robbie Williams]] to publicise the cause. The two visited [[Sri Lanka]] in this capacity to promote polio [[vaccination]]. Dury appeared with [[Curve (band)|Curve]] on the ''[[Peace Together]]'' concert and CD (1993), performing "What a Waste", with benefits to the Youth of Northern Ireland. He also supported the charity Cancer BACUP.{{cn|date=April 2023}}

Dury appeared in the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' episode that focused on [[Steely Dan]]'s album ''[[Aja (album)|Aja]]''.

Dury married Elizabeth "Betty" Rathmell on 3 June 1967 in Barnstaple, Devon, and they had two children, Jemima and [[Baxter Dury|Baxter]], in 1969 and 1971, respectively.
