In an interview with Sound of Boston, McCann noted his dislike for playing covers because of the way his music career began: "When I was a 15 year old and we first started a band, our job Monday to Friday was to play at clubs, playing [[Beatles]] covers and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] covers. We spent seven years writing our own songs, making our own albums, and people are like 'play Kanye West!' We're like 'no man, are you crazy?{{'"}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Bedian |first=Knar |date=5 March 2015 |title=Interview: Catfish and the Bottlemen |url=https://soundofboston.com/interview-catfish-and-the-bottlemen/ |website=Sound of Boston}}</ref>

The band initially promoted themselves by performing as support acts for friends' bands, including [[Northwich]]-based group [[The Shallow Call]],<ref>{{cite web |date=18 August 2009 |title=Northwich band The Shallow Call to launch new single at DeBees Music Bar in Winsford |url=https://www.cheshire-live.co.uk/news/local-news/northwich-band-shallow-call-launch-5218548 |website=Cheshire Live}}</ref> and by playing impromptu gigs in car parks following shows by bigger bands, such as [[Kasabian]].<ref name="bio" /> [[Steve Lamacq]] first played one of their early demos on [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] in March 2009.<ref>{{cite web |date=2009-03-06 |title=BBC Radio 6 Music - Steve Lamacq, 06/03/2009 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hz3rc |access-date=2020-06-06 |website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=BBC Introducing presents Catfish and the Bottlemen at the inaugural BBC music awards{{Snd}} Media Centre |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/catfish-bbc-music-awards |access-date=2016-06-01 |website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Later that year, Catfish and the Bottlemen competed in the 'North Wales Battle of the Bands', organised by Gareth Thomas, where they finished as runners-up to local band The Fides, who went on to perform at the Conwy River Festival.

In 2010, original drummer Jon Barr was replaced by Bob Hall, who was introduced to the band by Russ Hayes, a North Wales-based producer working with the band at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Edgoose |first=Simon |date=2016-09-07 |title=Bob Hall - Catfish and the Bottlemen |url=http://mikedolbear.com/interviews/bob-hall-catfish-bottlemen/ |access-date=2024-02-18 |website=Mike Dolbear}}</ref>

McCann first met future band member Johnny Bond at the Ravenstonedale Festival in 2011, where both bands were performing. At the time, Bond was a member of Symphonic Pictures, but he would later join Catfish and the Bottlemen in 2014.

The band's name originates from McCann's earliest musical memory: an Australian street busker he encountered in Sydney, known as [[Catfish the Bottleman]]. The busker earned the nickname "Catfish" due to his distinctive, spiky beard when he began performing in 2000,<ref>{{cite web |title=Catfish and the Bottlemen named after the legendary CATFISH THE BOTTLEMAN |url=http://catfishthebottleman.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629230823/http://www.catfishthebottleman.com/ |archive-date=29 June 2015 |access-date=7 August 2016}}</ref> and he played beer bottles strung to a wire.<ref>{{cite web |last=Barker |first=Emily |date=22 May 2015 |title=10 Things You Never Knew About Catfish and the Bottlemen |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/10-things-you-never-knew-about-catfish-and-the-bottlemen-1409372 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103111539/http://www.nme.com/photos/10-things-you-never-knew-about-catfish-and-the-bottlemen-1409372 |archive-date=3 January 2017 |access-date=27 June 2015 |website=NME}}</ref> In January 2015, McCann was reunited with Catfish the Bottleman at the [[Triple J]] studios in Sydney.

=== 2013–2016: ''The Balcony'' ===
In 2013, the band signed with [[Communion Music]] and released their first three singles, "[[Homesick (Catfish and the Bottlemen song)|Homesick]]", "[[Rango (song)|Rango]]", and "[[Pacifier (song)|Pacifier]]" the same year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Communion (United Kingdom) |url=http://www.communionmusic.co.uk/ |access-date=2020-06-06 |website=Communionmusic.co.uk}}</ref><ref name="BPI" />

However, just over a week before the first date, the gigs were postponed to 17–18 June 2022 due to [[COVID-19]] restrictions in Wales.<ref>{{cite tweet |number=1468523771606835201 |user=stereophonics |title=Following the announcement today made by the Principality Stadium & Kilimanjaro Live, unfortunately the shows in Cardiff on the 17th and 18th December have had to be been postponed due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and they will now take place on the 17th & 18th June 2022… https://t.co/UoWxkvva1Z |author=stereophonics |author-link=stereophonics |date=8 December 2021 |access-date=28 September 2022 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220710084613/https://twitter.com/stereophonics/status/1468523771606835201 |archive-date=10 July 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref> Then, on 3 June 2022, only weeks before the rescheduled shows, it was announced that Catfish and the Bottlemen had withdrawn from the gigs due to "unforeseen practical issues".<ref>{{cite tweet |number=1532422614731304960 |user=stereophonics |title=Due to unforeseen practical issues, Catfish & The Bottlemen will no longer be performing at the Principality Stadium shows. @FeederHQ will perform on Fri 17 June and @gruffingtonpost will perform Sat 18 Jun, joining very special guest @RealSirTomJones and @buzzardbuzzard https://t.co/M82qeGkui9 |author=stereophonics |author-link=stereophonics |date=2 June 2022 |access-date=28 September 2022 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220606055408/https://twitter.com/stereophonics/status/1532422614731304960 |archive-date=6 June 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Cancellations and backlash ====
On 1 September, just 15 minutes before doors were due to open, the band cancelled their Dublin show at RDS [[Royal Dublin Society|Simmonscourt]], with promoters [[MCD Productions]] citing "artist illness". Fans expressed frustration, particularly as many had travelled long distances for the band's first Irish show in five years.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-08-31 |title=Fan fury as Welsh band Catfish and the Bottlemen cancel Dublin gig minutes before show |url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-news/fan-fury-as-welsh-band-catfish-and-the-bottlemen-cancel-dublin-gig-minutes-before-show/a95492238.html |access-date=2024-11-08 |website=Irish Independent |language=en}}</ref> Subsequently, on 4 September, the band cancelled their Australian tour dates, scheduled from 4 to 12 September 2024. [[Live Nation Entertainment|Live Nation]] relayed a statement from the band apologising for the cancellations, attributing them to ongoing illness.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Varvaris |first=Mary |title=Catfish And The Bottlemen Cancel Australian Tour |url=https://themusic.com.au/news/catfish-and-the-bottlemen-cancel-australian-tour/yVx33dzf3sE/04-09-24 |access-date=2024-11-08 |website=The Music |language=en}}</ref> The band also cancelled its planned US tour.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Murray |first=Robin |date=2024-09-04 |title=Catfish & The Bottlemen Cancel North American Tour |url=https://www.clashmusic.com/live/catfish-the-bottlemen-cancel-north-american-tour/ |access-date=2024-11-08 |website=Clash Magazine |language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite the series of cancellations, the band made no official announcement addressing the situation directly, leaving fans seeking further clarification.<ref name=":0" />

==== ''The Balcony (10 Year Anniversary)'' release====

The anniversary edition also includes "Rango (Single Version)", "Hourglass (Ewan McGregor Cover)" and EP track, "ASA".

==== 2025 summer shows====
On 23 August 2024, Catfish and the Bottlemen announced two stadium shows for summer 2025, set for 1 August at the [[Millennium Stadium|Principality Stadium]] in Cardiff, and 3 August at [[Tottenham Hotspur Stadium]] in London. These will mark the band's first performances at stadium-sized venues.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 August 2024 |title=Catfish & The Bottlemen announce stadium shows for Summer 2025 |url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/catfish-and-bottlemen/summer-2025-stadium-shows-tickets-line-up-info-stage-times/ |access-date=2024-11-08 |website=Radio X |language=en}}</ref>

On 27 September, just weeks after cancelling their remaining 2024 shows, the band announced a performance at Manchester's [[Heaton Park]] scheduled for 13 June 2025.<ref>{{Cite web |date=27 September 2024 |title=Catfish and the Bottlemen announce huge show at Manchester's Heaton Park for 2025 |url=https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/catfish-and-bottlemen/manchester-heaton-park-2025-buy-tickets/ |access-date=2024-11-08 |website=Radio X |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Campbell |first=Jenna |date=2024-09-27 |title=Catfish and the Bottlemen announce massive Heaton Park gig for 2025 |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/catfish-bottlemen-announce-massive-heaton-30021465 |access-date=2024-11-08 |website=Manchester Evening News |language=en}}</ref> The announcement drew mixed reactions, with many fans—particularly those overseas—expressing disappointment that the band prioritised a new UK date over rescheduling their cancelled international shows.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jones |first=Danny |date=2024-09-27 |title=Catfish and the Bottlemen stun fans with surprise Heaton Park gig |url=https://themanc.com/audio/catfish-and-the-bottlemen-manchester-heaton-park-tickets-2025/ |access-date=2024-11-08 |website=The Manc |language=en-GB}}</ref>

On 4 April 2025, the band announced a performance at [[Glasgow Green]] on 9 July, with special guests [[The Wombats]] and [[The Fratellis]], held at the [[TRNSMT]] site.

The Belfast concert was part of the 2025 [[Belsonic]] festival.

==Musical style==
When reviewing ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', Scott Kerr of [[AllMusic]] compared the band's sound to [[Johnny Marr]], [[the Cribs]], [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] and [[Mystery Jets]].<ref name="all">{{cite web |last=Kerr |first=Scott |title=The Balcony{{Snd}} Catfish and the Bottlemen |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-balcony-mw0002697539 |access-date=13 January 2015 |website=[[AllMusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]]}}</ref> Ben Homewood of ''[[NME]]'' noted that McCann's vocal style resembles that of Luke Pritchard from [[the Kooks]].<ref name="nme" /> Discussing the musical direction of [[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|''The Ride'']], McCann stated, "I feel like everybody started thinking too outside the box trying to be arty and different. We wanted to stay inside the box."<ref>{{cite web |date=30 May 2016 |title=Album Review: Catfish and the Bottlemen{{Snd}} The Ride |url=http://consequence.net/2016/05/album-review-catfish-and-the-bottlemen-the-ride/ |website=Consequence.net}}</ref>

After the release of ''[[The Balance]]'', Catfish and the Bottlemen faced some criticism for their "formulaic" songwriting approach.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Allred |first1=Landry |title=Catfish and the Bottlemen's 'The Balance' sacrifices creativity for formula |url=https://thedailytexan.com/2019/04/29/catfish-and-the-bottlemens-the-balance-sacrifices-creativity-for-formula/ |access-date=19 December 2022 |website=thedailytexan.com}}</ref>
