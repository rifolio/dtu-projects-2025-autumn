'''Fall Out Boy''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]]<!--"Rock" is generally used on most band articles (see Nirvana, U2, etc) rather than more specific subgenres.--> band formed in [[Wilmette, Illinois]], a suburb of [[Chicago]], in 2001. The band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Patrick Stump]], bassist [[Pete Wentz]], lead guitarist [[Joe Trohman]], and drummer [[Andy Hurley]]. The band originated from [[Chicago hardcore|Chicago's hardcore punk scene]] and was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a [[pop-punk]] side project; Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before Hurley joined. Their debut album, ''[[Take This to Your Grave]]'' (2003), became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fan base through heavy touring.

With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, Fall Out Boy's 2005 major-label breakthrough, ''[[From Under the Cork Tree]]'', produced two hit singles, "[[Sugar, We're Goin Down]]" and "[[Dance, Dance (Fall Out Boy song)|Dance, Dance]]". It went [[RIAA certification|double platinum]], transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. Fall Out Boy received a [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] nomination at the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards|2006 Grammy Awards]]. ''[[Infinity on High]]'' (2007) debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles, "[[This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race]]" and "[[Thnks fr th Mmrs]]". Their following album, ''[[Folie à Deux (album)|Folie à Deux]]'' (2008), was a commercial disappointment and received a mixed response. Following the release of ''[[Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits]]'' in 2009, the band went on hiatus and the members worked on side projects.

The band reunited with ''[[Save Rock and Roll]]'' (2013), which became Fall Out Boy's second number-one album, and included the top 20 single "[[My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)]]". The same year, the band released the EP ''[[PAX AM Days]]'', consisting of eight punk-influenced tracks that were recorded during a two-day session with producer [[Ryan Adams]]. The band's sixth studio album, ''[[American Beauty/American Psycho]]'' (2015) peaked at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and spawned the top-10 hit "[[Centuries (song)|Centuries]]" and the single "[[Uma Thurman (song)|Uma Thurman]]" which reached No.&nbsp;22 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This was followed by their first remix album ''[[Make America Psycho Again]]'', which featured remixes of all original tracks from ''American Beauty/American Psycho'' by a different artist on each song, including [[Migos]] and [[Wiz Khalifa]].

The band's seventh studio album ''[[Mania (Fall Out Boy album)|Mania]]'' (2018), also peaked at No.&nbsp;1, making it the band's fourth No.&nbsp;1 album and sixth consecutive Top 10 album. The [[Mania Tour|Mania tour]] included a show at [[Wrigley Field]], marking their first headlining stadium show. In 2018, Fall Out Boy also received their second [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] for ''Mania''. On January 18, 2023, the group announced its eighth studio album, ''[[So Much (for) Stardust]]'', which was released on March 24.

==History==

===2001–2002: Early years===
Fall Out Boy was formed in 2001 in the [[Chicago]] suburb of Wilmette, Illinois by friends [[Pete Wentz]] and [[Joe Trohman]].<ref name="AllMusic Fall Out Boy">{{cite web|first=Johnny|last=Loftus|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fall-out-boy-mn0000170879/biography|title=Fall Out Boy {{!}} Biography & History|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 10, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627113213/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fall-out-boy-mn0000170879/biography|archive-date=June 27, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Wentz was a "visible fixture" of the relatively small [[Chicago hardcore]] scene of the late 1990s, performing in groups such as Birthright, Extinction and First Born. He was also part of the [[metalcore]] band [[Arma Angelus]] and the more political [[Racetraitor]], "a band that managed to land the covers of ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' and ''Heartattack'' fanzines before releasing a single note of music".<ref name=p65>Downey, 2013. p. 65</ref> Wentz was growing dissatisfied with the changing mores of the community, which he viewed as a transition from political activism to an emphasis on [[moshing]] and [[breakdown (music)|breakdowns]].<ref name=p65/> With enthusiasm in Arma Angelus waning, he created a pop-punk side project with Trohman<ref name="Vice History">{{cite web|first=Marianne|last=Eloise|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/fall-out-boy-take-this-to-your-grave-anniversary-2018/|title=Remembering Fall Out Boy's 'Take This To Your Grave'|work=[[Vice Media|Vice]]|date=May 8, 2018|access-date=February 12, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230330183543/https://www.vice.com/en/article/59qmpz/fall-out-boy-take-this-to-your-grave-anniversary-2018|archive-date=March 30, 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> that was intended to be "easy and escapist".<ref name=p65/> [[Patrick Stump]] was the drummer for [[grindcore]] band Xgrinding processX<ref name="Vice History"/> and a host of other bands that "never really managed." At a [[Borders (retailer)|Borders]] bookstore in [[Wilmette, Illinois|Wilmette]],<ref name=p66/> while Trohman was discussing [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] with a friend, Stump interrupted them to correct their classification of the band; the ensuing conversation soon shifted to Trohman and Wentz's new project.<ref name=p66/> Stump, viewing it as an opportunity to try out with "local hardcore celebrity" Wentz, directed Trohman to his [[MP3.com]] page, which contained sung-through acoustic recordings.<ref name=p66>Downey, 2013. p. 66</ref> Stump intended to try out as a drummer, but Trohman urged him to bring out his acoustic guitar; Stump impressed Trohman and Wentz with songs from [[Saves the Day]]'s ''[[Through Being Cool]]''. While Wentz wanted Racetraitor bandmate [[Andy Hurley]] to join the group as drummer, Hurley appeared uninterested and too busy at the time.<ref name=p66/>

The band's first public performance came in a cafeteria at [[DePaul University]] alongside Stilwell and another group that performed [[Black Sabbath|Black Sabbath's]] [[Black Sabbath (album)|self-titled debut album]] in its entirety.<ref name=p68/> The band's only performance with guitarist John Flamandan and original drummer Ben Rose was in retrospect described as "goofy" and "bad", but Trohman made an active effort to make the band work, picking up members for practice.<ref name=p68>Downey, 2013. p. 68</ref> During this performance, they introduced themselves as Forget Me Not.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=Chris|title=Where Are Your Boys Tonight?

I think they said their name was Forget Me Not at their first show. The next show, they were Fall Out Boy.}}</ref> Wentz and Stump argued over band names; the former favored verbose, [[tongue-in-cheek]] names, while the latter wanted to reference [[Tom Waits]] in name.<ref name=p68/> After creating a short list of names that included "Fall Out Boy", [[Fallout Boy (The Simpsons)|a fictional character]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and [[Bongo Comics]], friends voted on the name. The band's second performance, at a southern Illinois university with [[the Killing Tree]], began with Wentz introducing the band under a name Stump recalled as "very long".<ref name=p68/> According to Stump, an audience member yelled out, "Fuck that, no, you're Fall Out Boy!", and the band were credited later in the show under that name by Killing Tree frontman [[Tim McIlrath]]. As the group looked up to McIlrath, and Trohman and Stump were "die-hard" ''Simpsons'' fans, the name stuck.<ref name=p68/><ref name="Hear It">{{cite web|first=Jon|last=Wiederhorn|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/fallout_boy/|title=You Hear It First – Fall Out Boy|work=[[MTV]]|access-date=October 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218082744/http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/fallout_boy/|archive-date=February 18, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The group's first [[cassette tape]] demo was recorded in Ben Rose's basement, but the band later set off for [[Wisconsin]] to record a proper demo with [[7 Angels 7 Plagues]] drummer Jared Logan, whom Wentz knew through connections in the hardcore scene.<ref name=p68/>

Several more members passed through the group, including drummer Mike Pareskuwicz of Subsist and guitarist T.J. "Racine" Kunasch.<ref name=p68/> While Stump at this point felt uninterested in the group, Wentz, according to [[Uprising Records]] owner Sean Muttaqi, viewed the group as "the thing that would make him famous. He had a clear vision."<ref name=p68/> Wentz was "singularly focused on taking things to the next level" and began promoting the band via early [[social media]]. Muttaqi got word of the demo and wanted to release half of it as a split extended play with Hurley's band Project Rocket, which the band viewed as competition.<ref name=p68/> Uprising wanted to release an album with the emerging band, which had only written three songs at that point. With the help of Logan, the group attempted to put together a collection of songs in two days and recorded them as ''[[Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girlfriend]]''. The rushed recording experience and underdeveloped songs left the band dissatisfied.<ref name=p68/> When the band set off to [[Smart Studios]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] to record three songs for a possible split [[7-inch]] with 504 Plan, engineer Sean O'Keefe suggested the band record the songs with Hurley.<ref name=p70/> Hurley was recording an EP with his new group the Kill Pill in Chicago on the same day, but raced to Madison to play drums for Fall Out Boy. "It was still a fill-in thing but when Andy sat in, it just felt different. It was one of those 'a-ha' moments", recalled Wentz.<ref name=p70/>

===2003–2004: Early success and ''Take This to Your Grave''===
{{Main|Take This to Your Grave}}
The band booked a two-week tour with [[Spitalfield]], but Pareskuwicz was unable to get time off from work and Kunasch was kicked out of the band as the group "had all gotten sick of him".<ref name=p70>Downey, 2013. p. 70</ref> Kunasch was temporarily replaced by friend Brandon Hamm on guitar, alongside drummer [[Chris Envy]] from the recently disbanded [[Showoff (band)|Showoff]], but both quit prior to the kickoff of the tour.<ref name="p70"/> The band invited Hurley to fill-in once more, while Stump borrowed one of Trohman's guitars for the trek. While most shows were cancelled, the band played any show possible: "Let's just get on whatever show we can. You can pay us in pizza", remembered Wentz.<ref name=p70/> As the tour concluded, the general consensus was that Hurley would be the band's new drummer, and the band began to shop around the three songs from the group's unreleased split as a demo to record labels. The band members set their sights on pop-punk labels and attempted, with considerable effort, to join [[Drive-Thru Records]].<ref name=p71>Downey, 2013. p. 71</ref> A showcase for label co-founders went largely mediocre, and the band were offered to sign to side label [[Rushmore Records|Rushmore]], which they declined. They got particularly far in discussions with [[The Militia Group]] and [[Victory Records]], and Bob McLynn of [[Crush Management]] became the band's first manager.<ref name=p72>Downey, 2013. p. 72</ref> The band re-entered the studio with O'Keefe to record several more tracks to create label interest. Wentz felt "in the backseat" in writing the songs and temporarily questioned his place in the group, but Stump argued in his favor: "No! That's not fair! Don't leave me with this band! Don't make me kind of like this band and then leave it! That's bullshit!"<ref name="p72"/>

The band's early tour vehicle was a "tiny [[V6]] that was running on three cylinders, and it was not getting enough air, so it would drive really slowly", recalled Wentz. "We had to turn on the hot air to reach the speed limit, so we had the heat on all the time in 120-degree weather. It was so hot it melted the plastic molding around the windows. When it rained, we'd get all wet."<ref name="Hear It"/> [[John Janick]] of [[Fueled by Ramen]] had heard an early version of a Fall Out Boy song online and cold-called the band members at their apartment, first reaching Stump and later talking to Wentz for an hour.<ref name="p72"/> [[Rob Stevenson]] from [[Island Records]] eventually offered the band a "first-ever incubator sort of deal", in which they gave the band money to sign with Fueled by Ramen for the group's one-off debut, knowing they could "upstream" the band to radio on the sophomore record.<ref name="p72"/> Fueled by Ramen, at the time the smallest of independent labels clamoring to sign the band, would effectively release the group's debut album and help build the band's expanding fanbase before the group moved to Island.<ref name=p72/> The band again partnered with O'Keefe at Smart Studios, bringing together the three songs from the demo and recording an additional seven songs in nine days. The band, according to Stump, didn't "sleep anywhere that we could shower [...] There was a girl that Andy's girlfriend at the time went to school with who let us sleep on her floor, but we'd be there for maybe four hours at a time. It was crazy."<ref name=p73>Downey, 2013. p. 73</ref><ref name="No Longer Forced">{{cite web|first=Joe|last=D'Angelo|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494624/fall-out-boy-no-longer-sleeping-on-floors.jhtml|title=Fall Out Boy No Longer Forced To Sleep on Strangers' Floors|work=[[MTV]]|date=December 8, 2004|access-date=October 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224100730/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494624/fall-out-boy-no-longer-sleeping-on-floors.jhtml|archive-date=December 24, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> As the band progressed and the members' roles became more defined, Wentz took lyrics extremely seriously in contrast to Stump, who had been the group's primary lyricist up to that point.<ref name=p74>Downey, 2013. p. 74</ref> Arguments during the recording sessions led to what "most reductively boils down to Wentz writing the lyrics and Stump writing the melodies".<ref name="p66"/>

The band's debut album, ''Take This to Your Grave'', was released on May 6, 2003.<ref>{{cite web|first=Emily|last=Carter|url=https://www.kerrang.com/fall-out-boys-2003-mini-album-evening-out-with-your-girlfriend-hits-streaming-for-first-time|title=Fall Out Boy's 2003 mini-album Evening Out With Your Girlfriend hits streaming for first time|work=[[Kerrang!]]|date=November 3, 2021|access-date=February 12, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231020231953/https://www.kerrang.com/fall-out-boys-2003-mini-album-evening-out-with-your-girlfriend-hits-streaming-for-first-time|archive-date=October 20, 2023|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Greg|url=https://www.punknews.org/review/1896/fall-out-boy-take-this-to-your-grave|title=Fall Out Boy Take This to Your Grave (2003)|work=Punknews.org|date=May 6, 2003|access-date=February 12, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240123184558/https://www.punknews.org/review/1896/fall-out-boy-take-this-to-your-grave|archive-date=January 23, 2024|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Evening Out with Your Girlfriend'' was released shortly before ''Grave'' in March 2003, when the band had gained considerable momentum. "Our record was something being rushed out to help generate some interest, but that interest was building before we could even get the record out", said Uprising Records owner Sean Muttaqi.<ref name=p69>Downey, 2013. p. 69</ref> The band actively tried to stop Uprising from releasing the recordings (as the band's relationship with Muttaqi had grown sour), as the band viewed it as a "giant piece of garbage" recorded before Hurley's involvement, which the band members no longer considered their debut album.<ref name="p69"/> Gradually, the band's fanbase grew in size as the label pushed for the album's mainstream success. According to Wentz, shows began to end in a near-riot and the group were banned from several venues because the entire crowd would end up onstage.<ref name=p76>Downey, 2013. p. 76</ref> The band gained positive reviews for subsequent gigs at [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) and various tour appearances.<ref name="AllmusicBio">{{cite web|first=Johnny|last=Loftus|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fall-out-boy-p533936/biography|title=Biography: Fall Out Boy|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026124801/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fall-out-boy-p533936/biography|archive-date=October 26, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The band joined the [[Warped Tour]] for five dates in the summer of 2004, and on one date the band had only performed three songs when the stage collapsed due to the large crowd.<ref name="p76"/> The band appeared on the cover of the August 2004 edition of ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', and listening stations at [[Hot Topic]] partially helped the album move 2,000-3,000 copies per week by Christmas 2004, at which point the label considered the band "tipping" into mainstream success.<ref name=p76/>

It was the first Fall Out Boy record in which Stump created all the music and Wentz wrote all the lyrics, continuing the approach they took for some songs on ''Grave''. Stump felt that this process was much more "smooth" as every member was able to focus on his individual strengths.<ref name=Yes>{{cite news|title=Yes, R&B influences this emo band, But they'll be sure to stick with rock at Bamboozle Fest|last=Knopper|first=Steve|date=May 4, 2006|work=[[Newsday]]}}</ref> He explained: "We haven't had any of those moments when I play the music and he'll say, 'I don't like that,' and he'll read me lyrics and I'll say, 'I don't like those lyrics.'

Two weeks before recording sessions began, the group abandoned ten songs and wrote eight more, including the album's first single, "[[Sugar, We're Goin Down]]".<ref name="WeirdTitles"/>

Stump and Wentz met up for the first time in several years in early 2012 for a writing session. Wentz reached out to Stump after he penned his letter, as he too felt he was in a dark place and needed a creative outlet.<ref name=rstonerose/> He was at first reluctant to approach Stump, likening the phone call to reconnecting with a lover after years of acrimony.<ref name=rstoneemo/> "I know what you need – you need your band", Wentz told Stump.<ref name="rstoneemo"/> "I think it's kind of weird that we haven't really seen each other this year. We paid for each other's houses and you don't know my kid", Wentz remarked.<ref name="APCoverStory"/> The result, "three or four" new songs, were shelved with near immediacy, with the two concluding that "it just wasn't right and didn't feel right."<ref name="billboard3">{{cite magazine|first=Jason|last=Lipshutz|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/pete-wentz-qa-why-fall-out-boys-reunion-needed-to-be-a-secret-1558303/|title=Pete Wentz Q&A: Why Fall Out Boy's Reunion Needed To Be A Secret|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=April 16, 2013|access-date=April 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419042448/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1558303/pete-wentz-qa-why-fall-out-boys-reunion-needed-to-be-a-secret|archive-date=April 19, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Several months later, the two reconvened and wrote tracks that they felt truly represented the band in a modern form.<ref name="rstonerose"/> The band decided that if a comeback was in order, it must represent the band in its current form: "We didn't want to come back just to bask in the glory days and, like, and collect a few checks and pretend ... and do our best 2003 impersonation", said Stump.<ref name="mtv3"/> Afterwards, the quartet held an all-day secret meeting at their manager's home in New York City where they discussed ideas and the mechanics of getting together to record.<ref name="rstonerose"/><ref name="billboard3"/> Trohman was the last to be contacted, through a three-hour phone call from Stump. While Trohman was arguably the most excited to begin other projects, he had stipulations for rejoining the band. "If I'm not coming back to this band writing music […] then I don't want to", he remarked. Stump supported Trohman's ambition, saying Trohman "needed to be writing more".<ref name="APCoverStory"/>

The band members' main goal was to reinvent the group's sound from scratch, creating what Trohman called a "reimagining of the band", which focuses more on pop.<ref name="rstoneemo"/> Sessions were not without difficulties, as the band struggled initially to produce new material.
