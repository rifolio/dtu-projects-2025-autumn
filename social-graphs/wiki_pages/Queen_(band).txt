'''Queen''' <!-- Do not change this to "is" --> are <!-- is correct UK English --> a British [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1970 by [[Freddie Mercury]] (lead vocals, piano), [[Brian May]] (guitar, vocals), and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] (drums, vocals), later joined by [[John Deacon]] (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by [[progressive rock]], [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as [[arena rock]] and [[pop rock]].

Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]]. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, ''[[Queen II]]'', in 1974. ''[[Sheer Heart Attack]]'' later that year and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", which topped the [[UK singles chart]] for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format. The band's 1977 album ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' contained "[[We Will Rock You]]" and "[[We Are the Champions]]", which have become [[Stadium anthem|anthem]]s at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]" from ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'' (1980) became their best-selling single, and their 1981 compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album in the UK]] and has been certified [[RIAA certification|9× Platinum]] in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Their performance at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at [[Knebworth Festival|Knebworth]], England.

Mercury was diagnosed with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] in 1987. The band released two more albums, ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'' in 1989 and ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]'' in 1991. On 23 November 1991, Mercury publicly revealed his AIDS diagnosis, and the next day died of [[bronchopneumonia]], a complication of AIDS. One more album was released featuring Mercury's vocals, 1995's ''[[Made in Heaven]]''. Deacon retired in 1997, while May and Taylor continued to make sporadic appearances together. Since 2004, they have toured as "Queen +", with vocalists [[Paul Rodgers]] until 2009 and [[Adam Lambert]] since 2011.

Queen have been a global presence in popular culture for more than half a century. Estimates of their record sales range from 250&nbsp;million to 300&nbsp;million, making them one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. In 1990, Queen received the [[Brit Award]] for [[Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music|Outstanding Contribution to British Music]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001, and with each member having composed hit singles, all four were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2003. In 2005, they received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]]. In 2018, they were presented the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]], and they were awarded the [[Polar Music Prize]] in 2025.

==History==

===1968–1971: Foundations===
The founding members of Queen met in west London during the late 1960s. Guitarist [[Brian May]] had built [[Red Special|his own guitar]] with his father in 1963, and formed the group 1984 (named after [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|Orwell's novel]]) the following year with singer [[Tim Staffell]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=30,32–33}} May left the group in early 1968 to focus on his degree in Physics and Infrared Astronomy at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] and find a group that could write original material.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=37,44,64}} He formed the group [[Smile (band)|Smile]] with Staffell (now playing bass) and keyboardist Chris Smith.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=59}} To complete the line-up, May placed an advertisement on a college notice board for a "[[Mitch Mitchell]]/[[Ginger Baker]] type" drummer; [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], a young dental student, auditioned and got the job.{{sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=118}} Smith left the group in early 1969, immediately before a gig at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] with [[Free (band)|Free]] and the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=62}}

[[File:Queen @ Imperial College campus - 1970.jpg|thumb|left|Queen in 1970. Left to right; Mike Grose (who was the first of the band's three early bass players before John Deacon joined in 1971), Roger Taylor, Freddie Mercury and Brian May]]
While attending [[Ealing Art College]] in west London, Staffell became friends with fellow student [[Freddie Mercury|Farrokh "Freddie" Bulsara]], who was from [[Zanzibar]] and of Indian [[Parsi]] descent.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=44}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Freddie Mercury's complex relationship with Zanzibar |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45900712 |access-date=28 February 2019 |agency=BBC |archive-date=25 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025001722/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/world-africa-45900712 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bulsara had studied fashion design for a year before switching to graphic art and design,{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=56-57}} and soon became a keen fan of Smile. He asked if he could join the group as lead singer, but May felt Staffell would not give up that role.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=65}} He also ran a stall in [[Kensington Market, London|Kensington Market]] with Taylor.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=7}}

[[File:Queen First Public Performance Here 18 July 1970.jpg|thumb|upright|[[PRS for Music]] heritage award at [[Prince Consort Road]] commemorating Queen's first performance in London]]
In 1970, Staffell quit Smile, feeling his interests in [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] clashed with the group's hard rock sound and being fed up with the lack of success. He formed the group [[Humpy Bong]] with former [[Bee Gees]] drummer [[Colin Petersen]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=92–93}} The remaining members accepted Bulsara as lead singer, and recruited Taylor's friend [[Mike Grose]] as bassist. The four played their first gig at a fundraising event in [[Truro]] on 27 June 1970.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=95}} Bulsara suggested the group should be renamed to "Queen". The others were uncertain at first, but he said, "it's wonderful, dear, people will love it".{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=95}} At the same time, he decided to [[Name change#United Kingdom|change his surname]] to Mercury, inspired by the line "Mother Mercury, look what they've done to me" in the song "[[Queen (Queen album)#"My Fairy King"|My Fairy King]]".{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=96}} The group played their first London gig on 18 July.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21669973 |title=Heritage award to mark Queen's first gig |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=5 March 2013 |access-date=22 June 2018 |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326015501/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21669973 |url-status=live }}</ref> The early set consisted of material that later appeared on the first two albums, along with various rock and roll covers, such as [[Cliff Richard]] and [[the Shadows]]' "[[Please Don't Tease]]". They attracted the attention of producer [[John Anthony (record producer)|John Anthony]], who was interested in the group's sound but thought they had the wrong bass player.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=96}} After three live gigs, Mike Grose decided not to continue with the band and was replaced by [[Barry Mitchell (musician)|Barry Mitchell]] (ex [[Crushed Butler]]). Mitchell played thirteen gigs with Queen between August 1970 and January 1971.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=97}} In turn, Mitchell left in January 1971 and was replaced by [[Doug Bogie]] for two live gigs.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=102,105}}

===1971–1974: ''Queen'' and ''Queen II''===
In February 1971, [[John Deacon]] joined Queen. In addition to being an experienced bassist, his quiet demeanour complemented the band, and he was skilled in electronics.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=107}} On 2 July, Queen played their first show with the classic line-up of Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon at a Surrey college outside London.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2009|p=26}} May called Terry Yeadon, an engineer at Pye Studios where Smile had recorded, to see if he knew anywhere where Queen could go. Yeadon had since moved to [[De Lane Lea Studios]]' new premises in [[Wembley]], and they needed a group to test out the equipment and recording rooms. He tried asking [[the Kinks]] but couldn't get hold of them. Therefore, he told Queen they could record some demos in exchange for the studio's acoustic tests.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=112–113}} They recorded five of their own songs, "[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]", "[[Keep Yourself Alive]]", "[[Queen (Queen album)#"Great King Rat"|Great King Rat]]", "[[Queen (Queen album)#"The Night Comes Down"|The Night Comes Down]]" and "[[Queen (Queen album)#"Jesus"|Jesus]]". During the recording, producers John Anthony and [[Roy Thomas Baker]] visited the band. The two were taken with "Keep Yourself Alive" and began promoting the band to several record companies.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=114}}

Promoter Ken Testi managed to attract the interest of [[Charisma Records]], who offered Queen an advance of around £25,000, but the group turned them down as they realised the label would promote [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] as a priority. Testi then entered discussions with [[Trident Studios]]' [[Norman Sheffield]], who offered the band a management deal under Neptune Productions, a subsidiary of Trident, to manage the band and enable them to use their facilities, while the management searched for a deal. This suited both parties, as Trident were expanding into management, and under the deal, Queen were able to make use of the hi-tech recording facilities used by signed musicians.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=117–118}} Taylor later described these early off-peak studio hours as "gold dust".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06s76l4|title=Queen: From Rags to Rhapsody – BBC Four|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=9 May 2018|archive-date=7 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207023709/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06s76l4|url-status=live}}</ref>

Queen began 1972 with a gig at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]], London where only six people turned up. After a few more shows, they stopped live performances for eight months to work on the album with Anthony and Baker.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=117–118}} During the sessions at Trident, they saw [[David Bowie]] with [[the Spiders from Mars]] live and realised they needed to make an impact with the album, otherwise they would be left behind.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=119–120}} Co-producers Anthony and Baker initially clashed with the band (May in particular) on the direction of the album, bringing the band's inexperience in the studio to bear.{{sfn|Doherty|2011|p=8}} The band's fighting centered around their efforts to integrate technical perfection with the reality of live performances, leading to what Baker referred to as "kitchen sink overproduction".<ref>{{cite book|last=Baker|first=J.I.|year=2019|title=The Music. The Life. The Rhapsody|page=31|publisher=LIFE Magazine}}</ref> The resulting album was a mix of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[progressive rock]].{{sfn|Doherty|2011|p=8}} The group were unhappy with the re-recording of "The Night Comes Down", so the finished album uses the De Lane Lea demo. Another track, "[[Headlong (song)#B-sides|Mad the Swine]]" was dropped from the running order after the band and Baker could not agree on a mix.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=121}} [[Mike Stone (record producer)|Mike Stone]] created the final mix for "Keep Yourself Alive", and he went on to work on several other Queen albums.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=122}} By January 1972, the band finished recording their debut album, but had yet to secure a record contract.{{sfn|Doherty|2011|p=8}} In order to attract record company interest, Trident booked a "showcase" gig on 6 November at [[The Pheasantry]], followed by a show at the [[Marquee Club]] on 20 December.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=17}}

Queen promoted the unreleased album in February 1973 on [[BBC Radio 1]], still unsigned. The following month, Trident managed to strike a deal with [[EMI Records]]. "Keep Yourself Alive" was released as a single on 6 July, with the album ''[[Queen (Queen album)|Queen]]'' appearing a week later. The front cover showed a shot of Mercury live on stage taken by Taylor's friend Douglass Puddifoot. Deacon was credited as "Deacon John" while Taylor used his full name, Roger Meddows-Taylor.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=126–127}} The album was received well by critics; Gordon Fletcher of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it "superb",<ref name=RS1 /> and Chicago's ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' called it an "above-average debut".<ref>{{Cite news|title=''Queen''|date=7 December 1973|periodical=Daily Herald|location=Chicago, IL|url=http://queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_12-07-1973_-_Queen_-_The_Herald%2C_Chicago%2C_IL|access-date=7 July 2008|archive-date=10 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710142019/http://queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_12-07-1973_-_Queen_-_The_Herald%2C_Chicago%2C_IL|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, it drew little mainstream attention, and "Keep Yourself Alive" sold poorly. Retrospectively, it is cited as the album's highlight, and in 2008 ''Rolling Stone'' ranked it 31st in the "100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time", describing it as "an entire album's worth of riffs crammed into a single song".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rstone.html|title=100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 2008|access-date=16 June 2011|archive-date=18 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718180414/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rstone.html|url-status=usurped}}</ref> The album was certified gold in the UK and the US.<ref name="bhsa" /><ref name="RIAAC" />

The group began to record their second album, ''[[Queen II]]'' in August 1973. Now able to use regular studio time, they decided to make full use of the facilities available. May created a multi-layer guitar introduction "Procession", while Mercury wrote "The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke" based on [[The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke|the painting of the same name]] by [[Richard Dadd]].{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=131–132}} The group spent the remainder of the year touring the UK, supporting [[Mott The Hoople|Mott the Hoople]], and began to attract an audience.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=19}} The tour ended with two shows at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 14 December, playing to 7,000 people.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=136–137}}

In January 1974, Queen played the [[Sunbury Pop Festival]] in Australia. They arrived late, and were jeered and taunted by the audience who expected to see home grown acts. Before leaving, Mercury announced, "when we come back to Australia, Queen will be the biggest band in the world!"{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=138-139}}{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=21}} ''Queen II'' was released in March, and features [[Mick Rock]]'s iconic [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]]-inspired image of the band on the cover.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=137,142}} This image would later be used as the basis for "Bohemian Rhapsody" music video production.<ref name="cover">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm | title = Photographer lives the Rock dream | last = Pryor | first = Fiona | work = BBC News | date = 10 May 2007 | access-date = 25 May 2011 | archive-date = 24 February 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210224113639/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm | url-status = live }}</ref>{{refn|name="history"}} The album reached number five on the [[UK Album Chart|British album chart]] and became the first Queen album to chart in the UK.

Deacon wrote his first song for the group, "Misfire", while the live favourite "[[Stone Cold Crazy]]" was credited to the whole band. Mercury wrote the closing number, "In the Lap of the Gods… Revisited", with the intention that the audience could sing along to the chorus when played live.

In January 1975, Queen left for a world tour with an upgraded light show. They toured the US as headliners, and played in Canada for the first time.{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=25}} Several dates were cancelled after Mercury contracted [[laryngitis]].{{sfn|Dean|1986|pp=24–27}} The band then toured Japan from mid-April to the beginning of May. They were greeted by thousands of screaming fans, and played eight times in seven cities.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=163}}{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=27}} Despite the success, Queen were still tied to the original Trident deal and wages. They were all living in relative poverty in bedsits, and Deacon was refused money for a deposit on a house. EMI contacted lawyer [[Jim Beach]], who tried to find a way of extracting them from their contract. Trident complained that they had invested £200,000 in Queen and wanted their money back first.{{sfn|Blake|2010|pp=160,165}} In August, after an acrimonious split with Trident, the band negotiated themselves out of their contract and searched for new management.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=166}} One of the options they considered was an offer from [[Led Zeppelin]]'s manager, [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], who wanted them to sign with Led Zeppelin's own production company, [[Swan Song Records]]. The band were concerned about being a lower priority than Zeppelin and [[Bad Company]] (also signed to Swan Song) and instead contacted [[Elton John]]'s manager, [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], who accepted the position.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=166}}{{sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=166}} Reid's first instruction to the band was "I'll take care of the business; you make the best record you can".{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=168}}

Queen started work on their fourth album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'', taking its name from the popular [[Marx Brothers]] movie. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produced, costing £40,000 and using three different studios.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=177}} Like its predecessor, the album features diverse musical styles and experimentation with stereo sound. Mercury wrote the opening song "[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]", a savage dig at perceived wrongdoers (and later dedicated to Trident in concert){{sfn|Blake|2010|p=178}}{{sfn|Dean|1986|p=25}} and the camp vaudeville "Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon" and "Seaside Rendezvous".{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=178}} May's "[[The Prophet's Song]]" was an eight-minute epic; the middle section is a [[canon (music)|canon]], with simple phrases layered to create a full-choral sound. The Mercury penned ballad, "[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]", featured a harp and overdubbed vocal harmonies.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=179}}

The best-known song on the album, "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", originated from pieces of music that Mercury had written at Ealing College. Mercury played a run-through of the track on piano in his flat to Baker, stopping suddenly to announce, "This is where the opera section comes in".{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=170}} When the rest of the band started recording the song they were unsure as to how it would be pieced together. After recording the backing track, Baker left a 30-second section of tape to add the operatic vocals. Reportedly, 180 overdubs were used, to the extent that the original tape wore thin.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=170}} EMI initially refused to release the single, thinking it too long, and demanded a radio edit which Queen refused. Mercury's close friend and advisor, [[Capital London]] radio DJ [[Kenny Everett]], played a pivotal role in giving the single exposure.<ref name="Everett">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/kenny-everett--the-best-possible-way-to-remember-a-true-pioneer-8191316.html|title=Kenny Everett – The best possible way to remember a true pioneer|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=24 January 2015|archive-date=25 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925163508/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/kenny-everett--the-best-possible-way-to-remember-a-true-pioneer-8191316.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He was given a promotional copy on the condition he didn't play it, but ended up doing so fourteen times over a single weekend.{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=173}} Capital's switchboard was overwhelmed with callers inquiring when the song would be released.<ref name="Everett"/> With EMI forced to release "Bohemian Rhapsody" due to public demand, the single reached number one in the UK for nine weeks.<ref name="bhsa"/>{{sfn|Blake|2010|p=174}} It is the [[List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom|third-best-selling single]] of all time in the UK, surpassed only by [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" and [[Elton John]]'s "[[Candle in the Wind 1997]]", and is the best-selling commercial single (i.e. ''not'' for charity) in the UK.

"Bohemian Rhapsody" was promoted with a music video directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], who had already shot several of Queen's live concerts. The group wanted a video so they could avoid appearing on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', which would clash with tour dates, and it would have looked strange miming to such a complex song.<ref>Directed by Carl Johnston (4 December 2004).

Queen worked with [[David Bowie]] on the 1981 single "[[Under Pressure]]".

After working on various solo projects during 1988 (including Mercury's collaboration with [[Montserrat Caballé]], ''[[Barcelona (Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé album)|Barcelona]]''), the band released ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'' in 1989. The album continued the direction of ''A Kind of Magic'', using a pop-rock sound mixed with a few heavy numbers. It spawned the hit singles "[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]"—which became an anti-apartheid anthem in South Africa—"[[Scandal (song)|Scandal]]", and "[[The Miracle (song)|The Miracle]]".<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=The Platinum Collection |title-link=The Platinum Collection (Queen album) |others=Queen |year=2000 |first=Jim |last=Jenkins |author2=Smith, Jacky |author3=Davis, Andy |author4=Symes, Phil |page=12 |type=CD booklet |publisher=[[Parlophone]] |id=7243 5 29883 2 7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r15983|title=Queen; The Miracle|website=AllMusic|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101055559/http://www.allmusic.com/album/r15983|archive-date=1 January 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''The Miracle'' also began a change in direction of Queen's songwriting philosophy.
