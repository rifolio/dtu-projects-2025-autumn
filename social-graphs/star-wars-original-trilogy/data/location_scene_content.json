  "Rebel Blockade Runner": "An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-\nD2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way\nthrough the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are\nold and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His\nface is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.\nThreepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of\nhuman proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic\nsurface of an Art Deco design.\nAnother blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\nTHREEPIO\nDid you hear that? They've shut down\nthe main reactor. We'll be destroyed\nfor sure. This is madness!\nRebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in\nthe main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed!\nThe little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that\nonly another robot could understand.\nTHREEPIO\nThere'll be no escape for the Princess\nthis time.\nArtoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as\nloud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment\nare heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.\nTHREEPIO\nWhat's that?\n\nThe nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a\ntremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and\na score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make\ntheir way into the smoke-filled corridor.\nIn a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with\nlaserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns\ncreating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck\nbehind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers\nwho scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered\narms and faces.\nAn explosion hits near the robots.\nTHREEPIO\nI should have known better than to\ntrust the logic of a half-sized\nthermocapsulary dehousing assister...\nArtoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages\naround the two hapless robots.\n\nThe awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his\nway into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is\nDarth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured\nby his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which\nstands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the\nImperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away\nfrom the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through\nthe Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run\nin a frenzied panic.\n\nA woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.\nArtoo makes beeping sounds.\n\nThreepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is\nnowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel\nsoldiers can be heard in the distance.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?\nA familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and\nhe spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-\nfilled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years\nold) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place,\ndreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting\nsomething on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little\nrobot joins his companion.\nTHREEPIO\nAt last! Where have you been?\nStormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.\nTHREEPIO\nThey're heading in this direction.\nWhat are we going to do? We'll be\nsent to the spice mine of Kessel or\nsmashed into who knows what!\nArtoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the\nsubhallway. Threepio chases after him.\nTHREEPIO\nWait a minute, where are you going?\nArtoo responds with electronic beeps.\n\nThe evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies\nof his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as\nan Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.\nIMPERIAL OFFICER\nThe Death Star plans are not in the\nmain computer.\nVader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles\nin vain.\nVADER\nWhere are those transmissions you\nintercepted?\nVader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.\nVADER\nWhat have you done with those plans?\nREBEL OFFICER\nWe intercepted no transmissions.\nAaah... This is a consular ship.\nWere on a diplomatic mission.\nVADER\nIf this is a consular ship... were\nis the Ambassador?\nThe Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the\nDark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a\ngruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.\nVader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to\nhis troops.\nVADER\nCommander, tear this ship apart until\nyou've found those plans and bring\nme the Ambassador. I want her alive!\nThe stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.\n\nThe lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the\nstormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia\nOrgana, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her\neyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds\nof the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the\ntroopers spots her.\nTROOPER\nThere she is! Set for stun!\nLeia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with\nher laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a\nparalyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.\nTROOPER\nShe'll be all right. Inform Lord\nVader we have a prisoner.\n\nArtoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod.\nHe snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light\nbegins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into\nthe cramped four-man pod.\nTHREEPIO\nHey, you're not permitted in there.\nIt's restricted. You'll be deactivated\nfor sure..\nArtoo beeps something to him.\nTHREEPIO\nDon't call me a mindless philosopher,\nyou overweight glob of grease! Now\ncome out before somebody sees you.\nArtoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding\nthe mission he is about to perform.\nTHREEPIO\nSecret mission? What plans? What are\nyou talking about? I'm not getting\nin there!\nArtoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps\nand twangs angrily.\nA new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris\nthrough the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,\nafter a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky\nrobot jumps into the lifepod.\nTHREEPIO\nI'm going to regret this.\n\nPrincess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad\nof armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is\nbrutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly\nmarching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader\nemerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard\nat the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.\nLEIA\nLord Vader, I should have known.\nOnly you could be so bold. The\nImperial Senate will not sit for\nthis, when they hear you've attacked\na diplomatic...\nVADER\nDon't play games with me, Your\nHighness. You weren't on any mercy\nmission this time. You passed directly\nthrough a restricted system. Several\ntransmissions were beamed to this\nship by Rebel spies. I want to know\nwhat happened to the plans they sent\nyou.\nLEIA\nI don't know what you're talking\nabout. I'm a member of the Imperial\nSenate on a diplomatic mission to\nAlderaan...\nVADER\nYou're a part of the Rebel Alliance...\nand a traitor. Take her away!\nLeia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering\nhole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander\nturns to Vader.\nCOMMANDER\nHolding her is dangerous. If word of\nthis gets out, it could generate\nsympathy for the Rebellion in the\nsenate.\nVADER\nI have traced the Rebel spies to\nher. Now she is my only link to find\ntheir secret base!\nCOMMANDER\nShe'll die before she tells you\nanything.\nVADER\nLeave that to me. Send a distress\nsignal and then inform the senate\nthat all aboard were killed!\nAnother Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.\nThey stop and snap to attention.\nSECOND OFFICER\nLord Vader, the battle station plans\nare not aboard this ship! And no\ntransmissions were made. An escape\npod was jettisoned during the\nfighting, but no life forms were\naboard.\nVader turns to the Commander.\nVADER\nShe must have hidden the plans in\nthe escape pod. Send a detachment\ndown to retrieve them. See to it\npersonally, Commander. There'll be\nno one to stop us this time.\nCOMMANDER\nYes, sir.",

Rebel fighters flying in\nformation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly\npull away.\n\nThe group of X-wing fighters move in formation toward the\nDeath Star, unfolding the wings and locking them in the \"X\"\nposition.\n\nThe fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The\nDeath Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in\nsize as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the\nmetallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna\nis built into the surface on one side.\n\nAs the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome\nsize of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half\nof the deadly space station is in shadow and this area\nsparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines\nand occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a\ncity at night as seen from a weather satellite.\n\nTwo squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive\ntowards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across\nthe dark grey expanse of the huge station.\n\nLaserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-\nwing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death\nStar aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and\nfires.\n\nAn X-wing zooms across the surface of the Death Star.\n\nX-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star.\n\nLuke's X-wing races toward the Death Star.

The\nImperial Star Destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful\nbolts, which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull.\nThe big Star Destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of control.  As the\nImperial ship careers into deep space, the Rebel transport races away\nto safety.\n\nLuke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet.\nSoon it disappears into the stars.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one\nhuge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE fighters.\nAs it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized\nobjects.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star\nDestroyers.  Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight\ndown, closely followed by four TIE fighters.  The underside of the Star\nDestroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star\nDestroyers.  Slowly, it starts to veer to the left.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers,\nstill followed by four TIE fighters.

One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid\nand explodes in a brilliant flash of light.\n\nVader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space, guarded by its\nconvoy of TIE fighters.\n\nThe Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn.  In the next moment it\nis racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the\nmassive surface of the Imperial ship.  As it moves across the surface\nof the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous\nflak bursts.\n\nThe fleet around Vader's Star Destroyer now includes Needa's Star\nDestroyer, the Avenger.\n\nVader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships.  the\nAvenger glides off into space in the opposite direction.  No one on\nthat ship or on Vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the\nAvenger, is the pirateship, the Millennium Falcon.\n\nAs the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its\nunderbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it.  Hidden among the\nrefuse, the Falcon tumbles away.  In the next moment, the Avenger roars\noff into hyperspace.  The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races\noff into the distance.  Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's\nship appears and moves after the Falcon.\n\nLuke's tiny X-wing rockets away from the green planet of Dagobah and\noff into space.\n\nLuke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city.\n\nThe Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races away from\nthe cloud-covered city.\n\nIn the distance the TIE fighters continue their chase, still shooting\nlasers.  Vader's Star Destroyer moves behind them, determinedly\nfollowing the Falcon.\n\nThe Falcon races through space followed very closely by the TIE\nfighters and the huge Imperial Star Destroyer.\n\nThe Falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge Star Destroyer\nwhich seems, by contrast, to stand still.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon is attached to a huge Rebel cruiser by a docking\ntube.  Rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a Rebel\ntransport ship hovers near the fleet.\n\nWhile Luke, Leia, and the droids stand, looking out the window of the\nstar cruiser, two escort fighters join the large ship.  Slowly, the\ncruiser turns and moves away into space.\nDISSOLVE TO\n\nThe boundless heavens serve as a back-drop for the MAIN TITLE, followed\nby a ROLL-UP, which crawls into infinity.\nEpisode VI\nRETURN OF THE JEDI\nLuke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an\nattempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the�vile\ngangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE\nhas secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even\nmore powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this\nultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels\nstruggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...\nPAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive\nsuperstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of\na giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small,\ngreen moon of ENDOR.\nAn Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored\nspace station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial\nshuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the\nDeath Star.\n\nA Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in\nspace above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor,\nEndor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward\nthe Death Star.\n\nThe vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a\ndozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and\nbattlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the\nHEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.\n\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the\nHeadquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms\noff into space.\n\nThere is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction\nproceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE fighters, and a few Star\nDestroyers move about. Now the huge Super Star Destroyer announces\nitself with a low roar and soon fills the frame.\n\nThe stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.\n\nThe vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel Star\nCruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon roars up to a\nspot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.\n\nWe are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then\nAckbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS\nINTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.\n\nThe Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as the\nRebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The\nMillennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as the\nspace armada bears down on its target.\n\nThe Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid\nthe unseen wall.\n\nThe Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat\nwith Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the\nRebel armada.\n\nThe giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance from the\nbattle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in the middle of\nthe fleet.\n\nThe air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings\ndogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel cruiser is\nhit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.\nThe Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely byseveral TIE\nfighters.\n\nThe Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death\nStar's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star\nDestroyers.\n\nThe two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each\nother in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer\nexplodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a\nseries of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next\nto a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the\nImperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack\none of the larger Imperial ships.\nLANDO\nWatch out.

  "Tatooine": "A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.\nThe tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone\nfigure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations\nwho looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy\nhair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable\nlad with a prize-winning smile.\nA light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a\nlarge battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the\ndesert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided\nby a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot\nappears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.\nA bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and\nhe instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his\nutility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying\nthe heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired\nLandspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet\nabove the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the\ntiny robot to follow him.\nLUKE\nHurry up! Come with me! What are you\nwaiting for?! Get in gear!\nThe robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and\nsmoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his\narms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps\ninto his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum\nmadly.\n\nHeat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white\nbuildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty\nempty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to\nget out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist\nat Luke as he flies past.\nWOMAN\nI've told you kids to slow down!\n\nDAY\nThe group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie\nand The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes.\nLuke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.\nLUKE\nThere they are!\nBiggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to\nsee something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars\nBiggs sees two small silver specks.\nBIGGS\nThat's no battle, hot shot... they're\njust sitting there! Probably a\nfreighter-tanker refueling.\nLUKE\nBut there was a lot of firing\nearlier...\nCamie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the\nbuilding in the process. Luke grabs them.\nLUKE\nHey, easy with those...\nCAMIE\nDon't worry about it, Wormie.\nThe Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs\nhis shoulders in resignation.\nFIXER\nI keep telling you, the Rebellion is\na long way from here. I doubt if the\nEmpire would even fight to keep this\nsystem. Believe me Luke, this planet\nis a big hunk of nothing...\nLuke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The\ngroup stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about\nLuke's ineptitude.\n\nJundland, or \"No Man's Land\", where the rugged desert mesas\nmeet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids\nkick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily\nwork their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in\nthe distance rests half buried in the sand.\nTHREEPIO\nHow did I get into this mess? I really\ndon't know how. We seem to be made\nto suffer. It's our lot in life.\nArtoo answers with beeping sounds.\nTHREEPIO\nI've got to rest before I fall apart.\nMy joints are almost frozen.\nArtoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.\nTHREEPIO\nWhat a desolate place this is.\nSuddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts\noff in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio\nstops and yells at him.\nTHREEPIO\nWhere are you going?\nA stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small\nrobot.\nTHREEPIO\nWell, I'm not going that way. It's\nmuch too rocky. This way is much\neasier.\nArtoo counters with a long whistle.\nTHREEPIO\nWhat makes you think there are\nsettlements over there?\nArtoo continues to make beeping sounds.\nTHREEPIO\nDon't get technical with me.\nArtoo continues to make beeping sounds.\nTHREEPIO\nWhat mission? What are you talking\nabout? I've had just about enough of\nyou! Go that way! You'll be\nmalfunctioning within a day, you\nnearsighted scrap pile!\nThreepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the\ndirection of the vast dune sea.\nTHREEPIO\nAnd don't let me catch you following\nme begging for help, because you\nwon't get it.\nArtoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges\noff in the direction of the towering mesas.\nTHREEPIO\nNo more adventures. I'm not going\nthat way.\nArtoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant\nmountains.\n\nThreepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a\ndune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless\nmiles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant\nrock mesas.\nTHREEPIO\nThat malfunctioning little twerp.\nThis is all his fault! He tricked me\ninto going this way, but he'll do no\nbetter.\nIn a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand\nfrom his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of\nreflected light in the distance reveals an object moving\ntowards him.\nTHREEPIO\nWait, what's that? A transport! I'm\nsaved!\nThe bronze android waves frantically and yells at the\napproaching transport.\nTHREEPIO\nOver here! Help! Please, help!\n\nLuke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer\nand the others can be heard working inside.\nLUKE\n(Very animated)\n...so I cut off my power, shut down\nthe afterburners and came in low on\nDeak's trail. I was so close I thought\nI was going to fry my instruments.\nAs it was I busted up the Skyhopper\npretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty\nupset. He grounded me for the rest\nof the season. You should have been\nthere... it was fantastic.\nBIGGS\nYou ought to take it easy Luke. You\nmay be the hottest bushpilot this\nside of Mos Eisley, but those little\nSkyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it\nup, and one day, whammo, you're going\nto be nothing more than a dark spot\non the down side of a canyon wall.\nLUKE\nLook who's talking. Now that you've\nbeen around those giant starships\nyou're beginning to sound like my\nuncle. You've gotten soft in the\ncity...\nBIGGS\nI've missed you kid.\nLUKE\nWell, things haven't been the same\nsince you left, Biggs. It's been\nso... quiet.\nBiggs looks around then leans close to Luke.\nBIGGS\nLuke, I didn't come back just to say\ngood-bye... I shouldn't tell you\nthis, but you're the only one I can\ntrust... and if I don't come back, I\nwant somebody to know.\nLuke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.\nLUKE\nWhat are you talking about?\nBIGGS\nI made some friends at the Academy.\n(he whispers)\n...when our frigate goes to one of\nthe central systems, we're going to\njump ship and join the Alliance...\nLuke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.\nLUKE\nJoin the Rebellion?! Are you kidding!\nHow?\nBIGGS\nQuiet down will ya! You got a mouth\nbigger than a meteor crater!\nLUKE\nI'm sorry. I'm quiet.\n(he whispers)\nListen how quiet I am. You can barely\nhear me...\nBiggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.\nBIGGS\nMy friend has a friend on Bestine\nwho might help us make contact.\nLUKE\nYou're crazy! You could wander around\nforever trying to find them.\nBIGGS\nI know it's a long shot, but if I\ndon't find them I'll do what I can\non my own... It's what we always\ntalked about. Luke, I'm not going to\nwait for the Empire to draft me into\nservice. The Rebellion is spreading\nand I want to be on the right side --\nthe side I believe in.\nLUKE\nAnd I'm stuck here...\nBIGGS\nI thought you were going to the\nAcademy next term. You'll get your\nchance to get off this rock.\nLUKE\nNot likely! I had to cancel my\napplication. There has been a lot of\nunrest among the Sandpeople since\nyou left... they've even raided the\noutskirts of Anchorhead.\nBIGGS\nYour uncle could hold off a whole\ncolony of Sandpeople with one blaster.\nLUKE\nI know, but he's got enough vaporators\ngoing to make the place pay off. He\nneeds me for just one more season. I\ncan't leave him now.\nBIGGS\nI feel for you, Luke, you're going\nto have to learn what seems to be\nimportant or what really is important.\nWhat good is all your uncle's work\nif it's taken over by the Empire?...\nYou know they're starting to\nnationalize commerce in the central\nsystems... it won't be long before\nyour uncle is merely a tenant, slaving\nfor the greater glory of the Empire.\nLUKE\nIt couldn't happen here. You said it\nyourself. The Empire won't bother\nwith this rock.\nBIGGS\nThings always change.\nLUKE\nI wish I was going... Are you going\nto be around long?\nBIGGS\nNo, I'm leaving in the morning...\nLUKE\nThen I guess I won't see you.\nBIGGS\nMaybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.\nLUKE\nWell, I'll be at the Academy next\nseason... after that who knows. I\nwon't be drafted into the Imperial\nStarfleet that's for sure... Take\ncare of yourself, you'll always be\nthe best friend I've got.\nBIGGS\nSo long, Luke.\nBiggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the\npower station.\n\nThe gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange\nforeboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures\nfill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock\ncanyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he\ngoes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for\na moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.\nIn the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall\nand a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little\nfurther up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a\npair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the\nnarrow path.\nThe unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until\nsuddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out\nof the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages\none short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his\nback. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then\noff again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller\nthan Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they\ncautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and\ntheir faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be\nseen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave\nthe heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down\nthe trail.\n\nThe eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-\nlike vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a\nsmall disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a\nlarge tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot\nis sucked into the giant machine.\nThe filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders\nand enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.\n\nThe enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent\ntwin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain\nridge.\n\nFour Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-\nburied lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine.\nA trooper yells to an officer some distance away.\nFIRST TROOPER\nSomeone was in the pod. The tracks\ngo off in this direction.\nA second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand\nand gives it to the first trooper.\nSECOND TROOPER\nLook, sir -- droids.\n\nThe Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.\n\nThe Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their\nbattered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of\nthe enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small\nhomestead consisting of three large holes in the ground\nsurrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small\nadobe block house.\nThe Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening\nthem up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow.\nThe shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting\nsmall insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils\nshould be.\nOut of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars,\na large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are\nsunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully\ninspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump-\nshouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little\nJawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales\npitch in a queer, unintelligible language.\nA voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the\nhomestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru\nstanding in the main courtyard.\nBERU\nLuke, tell Owen that if he gets a\ntranslator to be sure it speaks Bocce.\nLUKE\nIt looks like we don't have much of\na choice but I'll remind him.\nLuke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment\nfor sale with the Jawa leader.\nOWEN\nI have no need for a protocol droid.\nTHREEPIO\n(quickly)\nSir -- not in an environment such as\nthis -- that's why I've also been\nprogrammed for over thirty secondary\nfunctions that...\nOWEN\nWhat I really need is a droid that\nunderstands the binary language of\nmoisture vaporators.\nTHREEPIO\nVaporators! Sir -- My first job was\nprogramming binary load lifter...\nvery similar to your vaporators. You\ncould say...\nOWEN\nDo you speak Bocce?\nTHREEPIO\nOf course I can, sir. It's like a\nsecond language for me... I'm as\nfluent in Bocce...\nOWEN\nAll right shut up!\n(turning to Jawa)\nI'll take this one.\nTHREEPIO\nShutting up, sir.\nOWEN\nLuke, take these two over to the\ngarage, will you? I want you to have\nboth of them cleaned up before dinner.\nLUKE\nBut I was going into Toshi Station\nto pick up some power converters...\nOWEN\nYou can waste time with your friends\nwhen your chores are done. Now come\non, get to it!\nLUKE\nAll right, come on! And the red one,\ncome on. Well, come on, Red, let's\ngo.\nAs the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back\ninto the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep\nand starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained\nby a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.\nOwen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two\nrobots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the\nhead of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.\nLUKE\nUncle Owen...\nOWEN\nYeah?\nLUKE\nThis R2 unit has a bad motivator.\nLook!\nOWEN\n(to the head Jawa)\nHey, what're you trying to push on\nus?\nThe Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked\nout of line and is moving up and down trying to attract\nattention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps\nLuke on the shoulder.\nTHREEPIO\n(pointing to Artoo)\nExcuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is\nin prime condition. A real bargain.\nLUKE\nUncle Owen...\nOWEN\nYeah?\nLUKE\nWhat about that one?\nOWEN\n(to Jawa)\nWhat about that blue one? We'll take\nthat one.\nWith a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged\nastro-droid for Artoo.\nLUKE\nYeah, take it away.\nTHREEPIO\nUh, I'm quite sure you'll be very\npleased with that one, sir. He really\nis in first-class condition. I've\nworked with him before. Here he comes.\nOwen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots\ntrudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.\nLUKE\nOkay, let's go.\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nNow, don't you forget this! Why I\nshould stick my neck out for you is\nquite beyond my capacity!\n\nThe giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a\ndistant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few\nmoments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the\nhomestead.\n\nLuke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead\nand searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-\nrobot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the\nsalt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his\nelectrobinoculars.\nTHREEPIO\nThat R2 unit has always been a\nproblem. These astro-droids are\ngetting quite out of hand. Even I\ncan't understand their logic at times.\nLUKE\nHow could I be so stupid? He's nowhere\nin sight. Blast it!\nTHREEPIO\nPardon me, sir, but couldn't we go\nafter him?\nLUKE\nIt's too dangerous with all the\nSandpeople around. We'll have to\nwait until morning.\nOwen yells up from the homestead plaza.\nOWEN\nLuke, I'm shutting the power down\nfor the night.\nLUKE\nAll right, I'll be there in a few\nminutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.\nHe takes one final look across the dim horizon.\nLUKE\nYou know that little droid is going\nto cause me a lot of trouble.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, he excels at that, sir.\n\nThe rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio\npilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast\nwasteland.\nINT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING -\nDAY\nLuke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something\nin the motor compartment.\nLUKE\n(yelling)\nHow's that.\nThreepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the\nwind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.\nLUKE\nOld Ben Kenobi lives out in this\ndirection somewhere, but I don't see\nhow that R2 unit could have come\nthis far. We must have missed him.\nUncle Owen isn't going to take this\nvery well.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, would it help if you told him\nit was my fault.\nLUKE\n(brightening)\nSure. He needs you. He'd probably\nonly deactivate you for a day or\nso...\nTHREEPIO\nDeactivate! Well, on the other hand\nif you hadn't removed his restraining\nbolt...\nLUKE\nWait, there's something dead ahead\non the scanner. It looks like our\ndroid... hit the accelerator.\n\nFrom high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen\ngliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground\ntwo weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert\ncloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the\nmarginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle\nand points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs\nthe gun before it can be fired.\nThe Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called,\nspeak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an\nanimated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in\nthe final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.\n\nThe Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied\nto a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large\nas elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns,\nand long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders\nmount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs\nand ride off down the rugged bluff.\n\nThe speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke,\nwith his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands\nbefore little Artoo.\nLUKE\nHey, whoa, just where do you think\nyou're going?\nThe little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses\nmenacingly behind the little runaway.\nTHREEPIO\nMaster Luke here is your rightful\nowner. We'll have no more of this\nObi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't\ntalk to me about your mission, either.\nYou're fortunate he doesn't blast\nyou into a million pieces right here.\nLUKE\nWell, come on. It's getting late. I\nonly hope we can get back before\nUncle Owen really blows up.\nTHREEPIO\nIf you don't mind my saying so, sir,\nI think you should deactivate the\nlittle fugitive until you've gotten\nhim back to your workshop.\nLUKE\nNo, he's not going to try anything.\nSuddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic\nwhistles and screams.\nLUKE\nWhat's wrong with him now?\nTHREEPIO\nOh my... sir, he says there are\nseveral creatures approaching from\nthe southeast.\nLuke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.\nLUKE\nSandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's\nhave a look. Come on.\n\nLuke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and\nscans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the\ntwo riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young\nadventurer.\nLUKE\nThere are two Banthas down there but\nI don't see any... wait a second,\nthey're Sandpeople all right. I can\nsee one of them now.\nLuke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his\nelectrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of\nhis field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large,\ngruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled\nand backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be\nheard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles\ndown the side of the mountain.\nThe towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed\ngaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in\nthe heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block\nthe blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces.\nThe terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced\nto the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands\nover him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible\nshrieking laugh.\n\nArtoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in\nthe rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the\ninert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the\nspeeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts\nand supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then\neverything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan\nis heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the\nSandpeople fleeing in terror.\nArtoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight\nswishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even\ncloser, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and\nleans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and\nweathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating\neyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes\nas he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a\nslight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.\nBEN\nHello there! Come here my little\nfriend. Don't be afraid.\nArtoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and\nbegins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on\nLuke's forehead and he begins to come around.\nBEN\nDon't worry, he'll be all right.\nLUKE\nWhat happened?\nBEN\nRest easy, son, you've had a busy\nday. You're fortunate you're still\nin one piece.\nLUKE\nBen? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to\nsee you!\nBEN\nThe Jundland wastes are not to be\ntraveled lightly. Tell me young Luke,\nwhat brings you out this far?\nLUKE\nOh, this little droid! I think he's\nsearching for his former master...\nI've never seen such devotion in a\ndroid before... there seems to be no\nstopping him. He claims to be the\nproperty of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he\na relative of yours? Do you know who\nhe's talking about?\nBen ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.\nBEN\nObi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats\na name I haven't heard in a long\ntime... a long time.\nLUKE\nI think my uncle knew him. He said\nhe was dead.\nBEN\nOh, he's not dead, not... not yet.\nLUKE\nYou know him!\nBEN\nWell of course, of course I know\nhim. He's me! I haven't gone by the\nname Obi-Wan since oh, before you\nwere born.\nLUKE\nThen the droid does belong to you.\nBEN\nDon't seem to remember ever owning a\ndroid. Very interesting...\nHe suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.\nBEN\nI think we better get indoors. The\nSandpeople are easily startled but\nthey will soon be back and in greater\nnumbers.\nLuke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic\nbeep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.\nLUKE\nThreepio!\n\nLittle Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins\nto chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and\nBen stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half\nburied in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.\nLuke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then\nflips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally\nthe mechanical man's systems turn on.\nTHREEPIO\nWhere am I? I must have taken a bad\nstep...\nLUKE\nCan you stand? We've got to get out\nof here before the Sandpeople return.\nTHREEPIO\nI don't think I can make it. You go\non, Master Luke. There's no sense in\nyou risking yourself on my account.\nI'm done for.\nArtoo makes a beeping sound.\nLUKE\nNo, you're not. What kind of talk is\nthat?\nLuke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little\nArtoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around\nsuspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the\nair.\nBEN\nQuickly, son... they're on the move.\n\nThe speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas\nSandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble\nand scattered bodies.\nLUKE\nIt looks like Sandpeople did this,\nall right. Look, here are Gaffi\nsticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...\nI never heard of them hitting anything\nthis big before.\nBen is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.\nBEN\nThey didn't. But we are meant to\nthink they did. These tracks are\nside by side. Sandpeople always ride\nsingle file to hide there numbers.\nLUKE\nThese are the same Jawas that sold\nus Artoo and Threepio.\nBEN\nAnd these blast points, too accurate\nfor Sandpeople. Only Imperial\nstormtroopers are so precise.\nLUKE\nWhy would Imperial troops want to\nslaughter Jawas?\nLuke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are\ninspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.\nLUKE\nIf they traced the robots here, they\nmay have learned who they sold them\nto. And that would lead them home!\nLuke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for\nthe speeder and jumps it.\nBEN\nWait, Luke! It's too dangerous.\nLuke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the\nburning Sandcrawler.\n\nLuke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.\n\nThe speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps\nout and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home.\nDebris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great\nbattle has taken place.\nLUKE\nUncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!\nLuke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle.\nSuddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is\nstunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new\nresolve comes over him.\n\nThere is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of\nthe Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the\ndead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to\nhim.\nBEN\nThere's nothing you could have done,\nLuke, had you been there. You'd have\nbeen killed, too, and the droids\nwould be in the hands of the Empire.\nLUKE\nI want to come with you to Alderaan.\nThere's nothing here for me now. I\nwant to learn the ways of the Force\nand become a Jedi like my father.\n\nThe Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it\nzooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff\noverlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard\narray of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A\nharsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts\nhis goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where\nBen is standing.\nBEN\nMos Eisley Spaceport. You will never\nfind a more wretched hive of scum\nand villainy. We must be cautious.\nBen looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined\nsmile.\n\nThe speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-\nhardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper\nquestions Luke.\nTROOPER\nHow long have you had these droids?\nLUKE\nAbout three or four seasons.\nBEN\nThey're for sale if you want them.\nTROOPER\nLet me see your identification.\nLuke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while\nBen speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.\nBEN\nYou don't need to see his\nidentification.\nTROOPER\nWe don't need to see his\nidentification.\nBEN\nThese are not the droids your looking\nfor.\nTROOPER\nThese are not the droids we're looking\nfor.\nBEN\nHe can go about his business.\nTROOPER\nYou can go about your business.\nBEN\n(to Luke)\nMove along.\nTROOPER\nMove along. Move along.\n\nThe speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina\non the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of\ntransport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are\nparked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle\nthe speeder.\nTHREEPIO\nI can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting\ncreatures.\nAs Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa\naway.\nLUKE\nGo on, go on. I can't understand how\nwe got by those troopers. I thought\nwe were dead.\nBEN\nThe Force can have a strong influence\non the weak-minded. You will find it\na powerful ally.\nLUKE\nDo you really think we're going to\nfind a pilot here that'll take us to\nAlderaan?\nBEN\nWell, most of the best freighter\npilots can be found here. Only watch\nyour step. This place can be a little\nrough.\nLUKE\nI'm ready for anything.\nTHREEPIO\nCome along, Artoo.\n\nThe young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow\nBen Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy\nden is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic\nalien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At\nfirst the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy,\nfurry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over\ndrinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group\nof repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender\nstops Luke and the robots.\nBARTENDER\nWe don't serve their kind here!\nLuke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many\noutlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's\ndrift.\nLUKE\nWhat?\nBARTENDER\nYour droids. They'll have to wait\noutside. We don't want them here.\nLuke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the\nGalactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures\nalong the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.\nLuke pats Threepio on the shoulder.\nLUKE\nListen, why don't you wait out by\nthe speeder. We don't want any\ntrouble.\nTHREEPIO\nI heartily agree with you sir.\nThreepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the\ncreatures at the bar go back to their drinks.\nBen is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-\nlooking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with\nfierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-\ncovered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.\nOver his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,\nand little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a\nsight to behold.\nBen speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times\nduring his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets\nout a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit\ndisconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between\nBen and the giant Wookiee.\nLuke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips\nhis drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear\nor whatever.\nA large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.\nCREATURE\nNegola dewaghi wooldugger?!?\nThe hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore\nthe creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby\nHuman and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the\nbelligerent monstrosity.\nHUMAN\nHe doesn't like you.\nLUKE\nI'm sorry.\nHUMAN\nI don't like you either.\nThe big creature is getting agitated and yells out some\nunintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young\nadventurer.\nHUMAN\nDon't insult us. You just watch\nyourself. We're wanted men. I have\nthe death sentence in twelve systems.\nLUKE\nI'll be careful than.\nHUMAN\nYou'll be dead.\nThe rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar\nmoves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His\nthree adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind\nLuke.\nBEN\nThis little one isn't worth the\neffort. Come let me buy you\nsomething...\nA powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young\nwould-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables\nand breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid.\nWith a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked\nchrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben.\nThe bartender panics.\nBARTENDER\nNo blasters! No blaster!\nWith astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life\nand in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut\nin two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,\ncut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns\noff his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt.\nLuke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities,\nattempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter\nof seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is\ngiven a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing\nhis bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben\npoints the the Wookiee.\nBEN\nThis is Chewbacca. He's first-mate\non a ship that might suit our needs.\n\nThreepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on\nan electronic conversation with another little red astro-\ndroid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches\ntwo stormtroopers in the street.\nTHREEPIO\nI don't like the look of this.\n\nStrange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking\ninstruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and\nfollows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is\nsitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years\nold. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental,\nand cocksure.\nHAN\nHan Solo. I'm captain of the\nMillennium Falcon. Chewie here tells\nme you're looking for passage to the\nAlderaan system.\nBEN\nYes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.\nHAN\nFast ship? You've never heard of the\nMillennium Falcon?\nBEN\nShould I have?\nHAN\nIt's the ship that made the Kessel\nrun in less than twelve parsecs!\nBen reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with\nobvious misinformation.\nHAN\nI've outrun Imperial starships, not\nthe local bulk-cruisers, mind you.\nI'm talking about the big Corellian\nships now. She's fast enough for\nyou, old man. What's the cargo?\nBEN\nOnly passengers. Myself, the boy,\ntwo droids, and no questions asked.\nHAN\nWhat is it? Some kind of local\ntrouble?\nBEN\nLet's just say we'd like to avoid\nany Imperial entanglements.\nHAN\nWell, that's the trick, isn't it?\nAnd it's going to cost you something\nextra. Ten thousand in advance.\nLUKE\nTen thousand? We could almost buy\nour own ship for that!\nHAN\nBut who's going to fly it, kid! You?\nLUKE\nYou bet I could. I'm not such a bad\npilot myself! We don't have to sit\nhere and listen...\nBEN\nWe haven't that much with us. But we\ncould pay you two thousand now, plus\nfifteen when we reach Alderaan.\nHAN\nSeventeen, huh!\nHan ponders this for a few moments.\nHAN\nOkay. You guys got yourself a ship.\nWe'll leave as soon as you're ready.\nDocking bay Ninety-four.\nBEN\nNinety-four.\nHAN\nLooks like somebody's beginning to\ntake an interest in your handiwork.\nBen and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers\nlooking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some\nquestions. The bartender points to the booth.\nTROOPER\nAll right, we'll check it out.\nThe stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben\nare gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.\nHAN\nSeventeen thousand! Those guys must\nreally be desperate. This could really\nsave my neck. Get back to the ship\nand get her ready.\n\nBEN\nYou'll have to sell your speeder.\nLUKE\nThat's okay. I'm never coming back\nto this planet again.\n\nFour heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a\nnarrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking\nexotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and\nrobots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and\nhiding from the hot winds.\nTHREEPIO\nLock the door, Artoo.\nOne of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves\non down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and\nThreepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.\nTROOPER\nAll right, check that side of the\nstreet. It's secure. Move on to the\nnext door.\nThe door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.\nTHREEPIO\nI would much rather have gone with\nMaster Luke than stay here with you.\nI don't know what all the trouble is\nabout, but I'm sure it must be your\nfault.\nArtoo makes beeping sounds.\nTHREEPIO\nYou watch your language!\n\nSPEEDER LOT\nBen and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot,\ntalking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder\ndealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass\nby as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.\nLUKE\nHe says it's the best he can do.\nSince the XP-38 came out, they're\njust not in demand.\nBEN\nIt will be enough.\nBen and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty\nalleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like\ncreatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his\nfaithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature\nmoves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as\nthey disappear down another alley.\nBEN\nIf the ship's as fast as he's\nboasting, we ought to do well.\n\nEight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad\ncreature.\nTROOPER\nWhich way?\nThe darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking\nbay.\nTROOPER\nAll right, men. Load your weapons!\n\nThe half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general\nalarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above\nthe dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the\nmorning sky.\n\nJabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by\ntwo smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke,\nHan, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is\nLando in disguise.\nHAN\nI think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a\nbig light blur.\nLUKE\nThere's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.\nHAN\nYou're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.\nLUKE\nJust stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.\nHAN\nOh... great!",
  "Imperial Star Destroyer": "On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified\nrobots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.\nCHIEF PILOT\nThere goes another one.\nCAPTAIN\nHold your fire. There are no life\nforms. It must have been short-\ncircuited.\n\nAn Imperial controller approaches his commander.\nCONTROLLER\nSir, Rebel ships are coming into\nour sector.\nCAPTAIN\nGood.  Our first catch of the day.",
  "Lifepod": "Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.\nStars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.\nTHREEPIO\nThat's funny, the damage doesn't\nlook as bad from out here.\nArtoo beeps an assuring response.\nTHREEPIO\nAre you sure this things safe?",
  "Power Station": "Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged\nmechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been\nasleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the\noffice, yelling wildly.\nFIXER\nDid I hear a young noise blast through\nhere?\nCAMIE\nIt was just wormie on another rampage.\nLuke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak\nand Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are\nplaying a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,\nhandsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy\ncity attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics\nof the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the\nbackground.\nLUKE\nShape it up you guys!... Biggs?\nLuke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great\njoy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.\nLUKE\nI didn't know you were back! When\ndid you get in?\nBIGGS\nJust now. I wanted to surprise you,\nhot shot. I thought you'd be here...\ncertainly didn't expect you to be\nout working.\n(he laughs)\nLUKE\nThe Academy didn't change you\nmuch...but you're back so soon? Hey,\nwhat happened, didn't you get your\ncommission?\nBiggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.\nBIGGS\nOf course I got it. Signed aboard\nThe Rand Ecliptic last week. First\nmate Biggs Darklighter at your\nservice...\n(he salutes)\n...I just came to say good-bye to\nall you unfortunate landlocked\nsimpletons.\nEveryone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend\nis almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of\nit.\nLUKE\nI almost forgot. There's a battle\ngoing on! Right here in our system.\nCome and look!\nDEAK\nNot again! Forget it.",
  "Sandcrawler": "It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo\nswitches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles\naround the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty\nmetal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and\nmaimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper\nand stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end\nof the chamber.\n\nArtoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the\nmiddle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various\nshapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation,\nwhile others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls\nout from the gloom.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!\nA battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.\n\nThreepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped\nprison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.\nTHREEPIO\nWake up! Wake up!\nSuddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,\ncreating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.\nThreepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights\npop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long\nchamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding\nwhite light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the\nodd assortment of robots.\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed.\nA Jawa starts moving toward them.\nTHREEPIO\nDo you think they'll melt us down?\nArtoo responds, making beeping sounds.\nTHREEPIO\nDon't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this\nnever end?",
  "Lars Homestead": "The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful\natmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers\nhimself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the\nbattered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery\nwith a cord to his face.\nTHREEPIO\nThank the maker! This oil bath is\ngoing to feel so good. I've got such\na bad case of dust contamination, I\ncan barely move!\nArtoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought\nas he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man\nSkyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage.\nFinally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he\nslams a wrench across the workbench.\nLUKE\nIt just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is\nright. I'm never gonna get out of\nhere!\nTHREEPIO\nIs there anything I might do to help?\nLuke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains\nand a tiny smile creeps across his face.\nLUKE\nWell, not unless you can alter time,\nspeed up the harvest, or teleport me\noff this rock!\nTHREEPIO\nI don't think so, sir. I'm only a\ndroid and not very knowledgeable\nabout such things. Not on this planet,\nanyways. As a matter of fact, I'm\nnot even sure which planet I'm on.\nLUKE\nWell, if there's a bright center to\nthe universe, you're on the planet\nthat it's farthest from.\nTHREEPIO\nI see, sir.\nLUKE\nUh, you can call me Luke.\nTHREEPIO\nI see, sir Luke.\nLUKE\n(laughing)\nJust Luke.\nTHREEPIO\nAnd I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg\nrelations, and this is my counterpart,\nArtoo-Detoo.\nLUKE\nHello.\nArtoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to\nscrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome\npick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping\noil from his bronze body.\nLUKE\nYou got a lot of carbon scoring here.\nIt looks like you boys have seen a\nlot of action.\nTHREEPIO\nWith all we've been through, sometimes\nI'm amazed we're in as good condition\nas we are, what with the Rebellion\nand all.\nLUKE\nYou know of the Rebellion against\nthe Empire?\nTHREEPIO\nThat's how we came to be in your\nservice, if you take my meaning,\nsir.\nLUKE\nHave you been in many battles?\nTHREEPIO\nSeveral, I think. Actually, there's\nnot much to tell. I'm not much more\nthan an interpreter, and not very\ngood at telling stories. Well, not\nat making them interesting, anyways.\nLuke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's\nneck joint. He uses a larger pick.\nLUKE\nWell, my little friend, you've got\nsomething jammed in here real good.\nWere you on a cruiser or...\nThe fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling\nhead over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-\ndimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being\nprojected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a\nrainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly\nlit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.\nLEIA\nHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my\nonly hope.\nLUKE\nWhat's this?\nArtoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio\nto translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment\nover and over.\nTHREEPIO\nWhat is what?!? He asked you a\nquestion...\n(pointing to Leia)\nWhat is that?\nArtoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice\nthe hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer\nfor Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the\nsentence fragment over and over.\nLEIA\nHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my\nonly hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nYou're my only hope.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely\na malfunction. Old data. Pay it no\nmind.\nLuke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.\nLUKE\nWho is she? She's beautiful.\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.\nLEIA\nHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...\nTHREEPIO\nI think she was a passenger on our\nlast voyage. A person of some\nimportance, sir -- I believe. Our\ncaptain was attached to...\nLUKE\nIs there more to this recording?\nLuke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic\nsqueaks and a whistle.\nTHREEPIO\nBehave yourself, Artoo. You're going\nto get us in trouble. It's all right,\nyou can trust him. He's our new\nmaster.\nArtoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.\nTHREEPIO\nHe says he's the property of Obi-Wan\nKenobi, a resident of these parts.\nAnd it's a private message for him.\nQuite frankly, sir I don't know what\nhe's talking about. Our last master\nwas Captain Antilles, but with what\nwe've been through, this little R2\nunit has become a bit eccentric.\nLUKE\nObi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means\nold Ben Kenobi?\nTHREEPIO\nI beg your pardon, sir, but do you\nknow what he's talking about?\nLUKE\nWell, I don't know anyone named Obi-\nWan, but old Ben lives out beyond\nthe dune sea. He's kind of a strange\nold hermit.\nLuke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few\nmoments.\nLUKE\nI wonder who she is. It sounds like\nshe's in trouble. I'd better play\nback the whole thing.\nArtoo beeps something to Threepio.\nTHREEPIO\nHe says the restraining bolt has\nshort circuited his recording system.\nHe suggests that if you remove the\nbolt, he might be able to play back\nthe entire recording.\nLuke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't\nreally heard what Threepio has been saying.\nLUKE\nH'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're\ntoo small to run away on me if I\ntake this off! Okay.\nLuke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off\nArtoo's side.\nLUKE\nThere you go.\nThe princess immediately disappears...\nLUKE\nWell, wait a minute. Where'd she go?\nBring her back! Play back the entire\nmessage.\nArtoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in\nembarrassment.\nTHREEPIO\nWhat message? The one you're carrying\ninside your rusty innards!\nA women's voice calls out from another room.\nAUNT BERU\nLuke? Luke! Come to dinner!\nLuke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning\nrobot.\nLUKE\nAll right, I'll be right there, Aunt\nBeru.\nTHREEPIO\nI'm sorry, sir, but he appears to\nhave picked up a slight flutter.\nLuke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and\nhurries out of the room.\nLUKE\nWell, see what you can do with him.\nI'll be right back.\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nJust you reconsider playing that\nmessage for him.\nArtoo beeps in response.\nTHREEPIO\nNo, I don't think he likes you at\nall.\nArtoo beeps.\nTHREEPIO\nNo, I don't like you either.\n\nLuke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher\nwith blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-\nused kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls\nof food and starts for the dining area.\nLuke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with\nsteaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red\ngrain.\nLUKE\nYou know, I think that R2 unit we\nbought might have been stolen.\nOWEN\nWhat makes you think that?\nLUKE\nWell, I stumbled across a recording\nwhile I was cleaning him. He says he\nbelongs to someone called Obi-Wan\nKenobi.\nOwen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but\nmanages to control himself.\nLUKE\nI thought he might have meant old\nBen. Do you know what he's talking\nabout? Well, I wonder if he's related\nto Ben.\nOwen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.\nOWEN\nThat old man's just a crazy old\nwizard. Tomorrow I want you to take\nthat R2 unit into Anchorhead and\nhave its memory flushed. That'll be\nthe end of it. It belongs to us now.\nLUKE\nBut what if this Obi-Wan comes looking\nfor him?\nOWEN\nHe won't, I don't think he exists\nany more. He died about the same\ntime as your father.\nLUKE\nHe knew my father?\nOWEN\nI told you to forget it. Your only\nconcern is to prepare the new droids\nfor tomorrow. In the morning I want\nthem on the south ridge working out\nthose condensers.\nLUKE\nYes, sir. I think those new droids\nare going to work out fine. In fact,\nI, uh, was also thinking about our\nagreement about my staying on another\nseason. And if these new droids do\nwork out, I want to transmit my\napplication to the Academy this year.\nOwen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress\nit.\nOWEN\nYou mean the next semester before\nharvest?\nLUKE\nSure, there're more than enough\ndroids.\nOWEN\nHarvest is when I need you the most.\nOnly one more season. This year we'll\nmake enough on the harvest so I'll\nbe able to hire some more hands. And\nthen you can go to the Academy next\nyear.\nLuke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.\nOWEN\nYou must understand I need you here,\nLuke.\nLUKE\nBut it's a whole 'nother year.\nOWEN\nLook, it's only one more season.\nLuke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.\nLUKE\nYeah, that's what you said last year\nwhen Biggs and Tank left.\nAUNT BERU\nWhere are you going?\nLUKE\nIt looks like I'm going nowhere. I\nhave to finish cleaning those droids.\nResigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen\nmechanically finishes his dinner.\nAUNT BERU\nOwen, he can't stay here forever.\nMost of his friends have gone. It\nmeans so much to him.\nOWEN\nI'll make it up to him next year. I\npromise.\nAUNT BERU\nLuke's just not a farmer, Owen. He\nhas too much of his father in him.\nOWEN\nThat's what I'm afraid of.\n\nLuke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in\nsight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt\nsimilar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the\nbox, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a\nshort yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.\nLUKE\nWhat are you doing hiding there?\nThreepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in\nsight.\nTHREEPIO\nIt wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't\ndeactivate me. I told him not to go,\nbut he's faulty, malfunctioning;\nkept babbling on about his mission.\nLUKE\nOh, no!\nLuke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.\n\nMorning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of\nthe open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of\nUncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.\nOWEN\nLuke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be\nloafing now!\n\nThe interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru\nprepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.\nOWEN\nHave you seen Luke this morning?\nAUNT BERU\nHe said he had some things to do\nbefore he started today, so he left\nearly.\nOWEN\nUh? Did he take those two new droids\nwith him?\nAUNT BERU\nI think so.\nOWEN\nWell, he'd better have those units\nin the south range repaired be midday\nor there'll be hell to pay!",
  "Kenobi's Dwelling": "The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but\nstill manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and\nsecurity. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as\nold Ben sits thinking.\nLUKE\nNo, my father didn't fight in the\nwars. He was a navigator on a spice\nfreighter.\nBEN\nThat's what your uncle told you. He\ndidn't hold with your father's ideals.\nThought he should have stayed here\nand not gotten involved.\nLUKE\nYou fought in the Clone Wars?\nBEN\nYes, I was once a Jedi Knight the\nsame as your father.\nLUKE\nI wish I'd known him.\nBEN\nHe was the best star-pilot in the\ngalaxy, and a cunning warrior. I\nunderstand you've become quite a\ngood pilot yourself. And he was a\ngood friend. Which reminds me...\nBen gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.\nAs Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the\nrestraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.\nLuke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the\ntable. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle\nwith several electronic gadgets attached to it.\nBEN\nI have something here for you. Your\nfather wanted you to have this when\nyou were old enough, but your uncle\nwouldn't allow it. He feared you\nmight follow old Obi-Wan on some\ndamned-fool idealistic crusade like\nyour father did.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, if you'll not be needing me,\nI'll close down for awhile.\nLUKE\nSure, go ahead.\nBen hands Luke the saber.\nLUKE\nWhat is it?\nBEN\nYour fathers lightsaber. This is the\nweapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy\nor as random as a blaster.\nLuke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out\nabout four feet and flickers there. The light plays across\nthe ceiling.\nBEN\nAn elegant weapon for a more civilized\ntime. For over a thousand generations\nthe Jedi Knights were the guardians\nof peace and justice in the Old\nRepublic. Before the dark times,\nbefore the Empire.\nLuke hasn't really been listening.\nLUKE\nHow did my father die?\nBEN\nA young Jedi named Darth Vader, who\nwas a pupil of mine until he turned\nto evil, helped the Empire hunt down\nand destroy the Jedi Knights. He\nbetrayed and murdered your father.\nNow the Jedi are all but extinct.\nVader was seduced by the dark side\nof the Force.\nLUKE\nThe Force?\nBEN\nWell, the Force is what gives a Jedi\nhis power. It's an energy field\ncreated by all living things. It\nsurrounds us and penetrates us. It\nbinds the galaxy together.\nArtoo makes beeping sounds.\nBEN\nNow, let's see if we can't figure\nout what you are, my little friend.\nAnd where you come from.\nLUKE\nI saw part of the message he was...\nLuke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful\nyoung Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.\nBEN\nI seem to have found it.\nLuke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before\nhis eyes.\nLEIA\nGeneral Kenobi, years ago you served\nmy father in the Clone Wars. Now he\nbegs you to help him in his struggle\nagainst the Empire. I regret that I\nam unable to present my father's\nrequest to you in person, but my\nship has fallen under attack and I'm\nafraid my mission to bring you to\nAlderaan has failed. I have placed\ninformation vital to the survival of\nthe Rebellion into the memory systems\nof this R2 unit. My father will know\nhow to retrieve it. You must see\nthis droid safely delivered to him\non Alderaan. This is our most\ndesperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan\nKenobi, you're my only hope.\nThere is a little static and the transmission is cut short.\nOld Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs\non a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.\nBEN\nYou must learn the ways of the Force\nif you're to come with me to Alderaan.\nLUKE\n(laughing)\nAlderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.\nI've got to go home. It's late, I'm\nin for it as it is.\nBEN\nI need your help, Luke. She needs\nyour help. I'm getting too old for\nthis sort of thing.\nLUKE\nI can't get involved! I've got work\nto do! It's not that I like the\nEmpire. I hate it! But there's nothing\nI can do about it right now. It's\nsuch a long way from here.\nBEN\nThat's your uncle talking.\nLUKE\n(sighing)\nOh, God, my uncle. How am I ever\ngoing to explain this?\nBEN\nLearn about the Force, Luke.\nLUKE\nLook, I can take you as far as\nAnchorhead. You can get a transport\nthere to Mos Eisley or wherever you're\ngoing.\nBEN\nYou must do what you feel is right,\nof course.",
  "Death Star": "Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black\nconference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around\nthe room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general,\nis speaking.\nTAGGE\nUntil this battle station is fully\noperational we are vulnerable. The\nRebel Alliance is too well equipped.\nThey're more dangerous than you\nrealize.\nThe bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.\nMOTTI\nDangerous to your starfleet,\nCommander, not to this battle station!\nTAGGE\nThe Rebellion will continue to gain\na support in the Imperial Senate as\nlong as....\nSuddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut\nshort and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial\noutland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally,\nThe Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and\nbow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his\nplace at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind\nhim.\nTARKIN\nThe Imperial Senate will no longer\nbe of any concern to us. I've just\nreceived word that the Emperor has\ndissolved the council permanently.\nThe last remnants of the Old Republic\nhave been swept away.\nTAGGE\nThat's impossible! How will the\nEmperor maintain control without the\nbureaucracy?\nTARKIN\nThe regional governors now have direct\ncontrol over territories. Fear will\nkeep the local systems in line. Fear\nof this battle station.\nTAGGE\nAnd what of the Rebellion? If the\nRebels have obtained a complete\ntechnical readout of this station,\nit is possible, however unlikely,\nthat they might find a weakness and\nexploit it.\nVADER\nThe plans you refer to will soon be\nback in our hands.\nMOTTI\nAny attack made by the Rebels against\nthis station would be a useless\ngesture, no matter what technical\ndata they've obtained. This station\nis now the ultimate power in the\nuniverse. I suggest we use it!\nVADER\nDon't be too proud of this\ntechnological terror you've\nconstructed. The ability to destroy\na planet is insignificant next to\nthe power of the Force.\nMOTTI\nDon't try to frighten us with your\nsorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your\nsad devotion to that ancient religion\nhas not helped you conjure up the\nstolen data tapes, or given you\nclairvoyance enough to find the\nRebel's hidden fort...\nSuddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's\nspell.\nVADER\nI find your lack of faith disturbing.\nTARKIN\nEnough of this! Vader, release him!\nVADER\nAs you wish.\nTARKIN\nThis bickering is pointless. Lord\nVader will provide us with the\nlocation of the Rebel fortress by\nthe time this station is operational.\nWe will then crush the Rebellion\nwith one swift stroke.\n\nTwo stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow\nseveral Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is\nfilled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a\ngiant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.\nVADER\nAnd, now Your Highness, we will\ndiscuss the location of your hidden\nRebel base.\nThe torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it\napproaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical\narms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut\nand the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled\nscreams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.\n\nVADER\nHer resistance to the mind probe is\nconsiderable. It will be some time\nbefore we can extract any information\nfrom her.\nAn Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting.\nIMPERIAL OFFICER\nThe final check-out is complete. All\nsystems are operational. What course\nshall we set?\nTARKIN\nPerhaps she would respond to an\nalternative form of persuasion.\nVADER\nWhat do you mean?\nTARKIN\nI think it is time we demonstrate\nthe full power of this station.\n(to soldier)\nSet your course for Princess Leia's\nhome planet of Alderaan.\nTROOPER\nWith pleasure.\n\nAlderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.\n\nAdmiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before\nGovernor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen\ndisplaying a small green planet.\nMOTTI\nWe've entered the Alderaan system.\nVader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her\nhands are bound.\nLEIA\nGovernor Tarkin, I should have\nexpected to find you holding Vader's\nleash. I recognized your foul stench\nwhen I was brought on board.\nTARKIN\nCharming to the last. You don't know\nhow hard I found it signing the order\nto terminate your life!\nLEIA\nI surprised you had the courage to\ntake the responsibility yourself!\nTARKIN\nPrincess Leia, before your execution\nI would like you to be my guest at a\nceremony that will make this battle\nstation operational. No star system\nwill dare oppose the Emperor now.\nLEIA\nThe more you tighten your grip,\nTarkin, the more star systems will\nslip through your fingers.\nTARKIN\nNot after we demonstrate the power\nof this station. In a way, you have\ndetermined the choice of the planet\nthat'll be destroyed first. Since\nyou are reluctant to provide us with\nthe location of the Rebel base, I\nhave chosen to test this station's\ndestructive power... on your home\nplanet of Alderaan.\nLEIA\nNo! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no\nweapons. You can't possibly...\nTARKIN\nYou would prefer another target? A\nmilitary target? Then name the system!\nTarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.\nTARKIN\nI grow tired of asking this. So it'll\nbe the last time. Where is the Rebel\nbase?\nLeia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to\nAlderaan.\nLEIA\n(softly)\nDantooine.\nLeia lowers her head.\nLEIA\nThey're on Dantooine.\nTARKIN\nThere. You see Lord Vader, she can\nbe reasonable.\n(addressing Motti)\nContinue with the operation. You may\nfire when ready.\nLEIA\nWhat?\nTARKIN\nYou're far too trusting. Dantooine\nis too remote to make an effective\ndemonstration. But don't worry. We\nwill deal with your Rebel friends\nsoon enough.\nLEIA\nNo!\n\nVADER\nCommence primary ignition.\nA button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A\nhooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.\nAnother lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another\nlever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A\nhuge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area\nand converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan.\nThe small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.\n\nImperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the\nevil Dark Lord Darth Vader.\nTARKIN\nYes.\nOFFICER CASS\nOur scout ships have reached\nDantooine. They found the remains of\na Rebel base, but they estimate that\nit has been deserted for some time.\nThey are now conducting an extensive\nsearch of the surrounding systems.\nTARKIN\nShe lied! She lied to us!\nVADER\nI told you she would never consciously\nbetray the Rebellion.\nTARKIN\nTerminate her... immediately!\n\nThe helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port\ncontrol room and huge laser turret cannons.\nVOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM\nClear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic\nfield.\n\nThe pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death\nStar, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers\nstand at attention in a central assembly area.\nOFFICER\nTo you stations!\n(to another officer)\nCome with me.\n\nStormtroopers run to their posts.\n\nA line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in\nreadiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons\nready to fire.\nOFFICER\nClose all outboard shields! Close\nall outboard shields!\n\nTarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz.\nTARKIN\nYes.\nVOICE\n(over intercom)\nWe've captured a freighter entering\nthe remains of the Alderaan system.\nIt's markings match those of a ship\nthat blasted its way out of Mos\nEisley.\nVADER\nThey must be trying to return the\nstolen plans to the princess. She\nmay yet be of some use to us.\n\nVader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and\nseveral heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.\nVOICE\n(over intercom)\nUnlock one-five-seven and nine.\nRelease charges.\nOFFICER\n(to Vader)\nThere's no one on board, sir.\nAccording to the log, the crew\nabandoned ship right after takeoff.\nIt must be a decoy, sir. Several of\nthe escape pods have been jettisoned.\nVADER\nDid you find any droids?\nOFFICER\nNo, sir. If there were any on board,\nthey must also have jettisoned.\nVADER\nSend a scanning crew on board. I\nwant every part of this ship checked.\nOFFICER\nYes, sir.\nVADER\nI sense something... a presence I\nhaven't felt since...\nVader turns quickly and exits the hangar.\nOFFICER\nGet me a scanning crew in here on\nthe double. I want every part of\nthis ship checked!\n\nThe crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the\ntwo stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.\nTROOPER\nThe ship's all yours. If the scanners\npick up anything, report it\nimmediately. All right, let's go.\nThe crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound\nis followed by a voice calling to the guard below.\nHAN'S VOICE\nHey down there, could you give us a\nhand with this?\nThe stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire\nis heard.\n\nIn a very small command office near the entrance to the\npirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices\nthe guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.\nGANTRY OFFICER\nTX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at\nyour post? TX-four-one-two, do you\ncopy?\nA stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and\nwaves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating\nhis comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his\nhead in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an\nannoyed look.\nGANTRY OFFICER\nTake over. We've got a bad\ntransmitter. I'll see what I can do.\nAs the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing\nthe towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary\nstate of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling\nhowl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow.\nThe aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted\nby Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the\nrobots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed\nas a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.\nLUKE\nYou know, between his howling and\nyour blasting everything in sight,\nit's a wonder the whole station\ndoesn't know we're here.\nHAN\nBring them on! I prefer a straight\nfight to all this sneaking around.\nTHREEPIO\nWe found the computer outlet, sir.\nBen feeds some information into the computer and a map of\nthe city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it\ncarefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.\nArtoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.\nBEN\nPlug in. He should be able to\ninterpret the entire Imperial computer\nnetwork.\nArtoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the\nvast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information\nto the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.\nTHREEPIO\nHe says he's found the main computer\nto power the tractor beam that's\nholding the ship here. He'll try to\nmake the precise location appear on\nthe monitor.\nThe computer monitor flashes readouts.\nTHREEPIO\nThe tractor beam is coupled to the\nmain reactor in seven locations. A\npower loss at one of the terminals\nwill allow the ship to leave.\nBen studies the data on the monitor readout.\nBEN\nI don't think you boys can help. I\nmust go alone.\nHAN\nWhatever you say. I've done more\nthat I bargained for on this trip\nalready.\nLUKE\nI want to go with you.\nBEN\nBe patient, Luke. Stay and watch\nover the droids.\nLUKE\nBut he can...\nBEN\nThey must be delivered safely or\nother star systems will suffer the\nsame fate as Alderaan. Your destiny\nlies along a different path than\nmine. The Force will be with you...\nalways!\nBen adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps\nout of the command office, then disappears down a long grey\nhallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head\nin agreement.\nHAN\nBoy you said it, Chewie.\nHan looks at Luke.\nHAN\nWhere did you dig up that old fossil?\nLUKE\nBen is a great man.\nHAN\nYeah, great at getting us into\ntrouble.\nLUKE\nI didn't hear you give any ideas...\nHAN\nWell, anything would be better than\njust hanging around waiting for him\nto pick us up...\nLUKE\nWho do you think...\nSuddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.\nLuke goes over to him.\nLUKE\nWhat is it?\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.\nHe says \"I found her\", and keeps\nrepeating, \"She's here.\"\nLUKE\nWell, who... who has he found?\nArtoo whistles a frantic reply.\nTHREEPIO\nPrincess Leia.\nLUKE\nThe princess? She's here?\nHAN\nPrincess? What's going on?\nTHREEPIO\nLevel five. Detention block A A-twenty-\nthree. I'm afraid she's scheduled to\nbe terminated.\nLUKE\nOh, no! We've got to do something.\nHAN\nWhat are you talking about?\nLUKE\nThe droid belongs to her. She's the\none in the message... We've got to\nhelp her.\nHAN\nNow, look, don't get any funny ideas.\nThe old man wants us to wait right\nhere.\nLUKE\nBut he didn't know she was here.\nLook, will you just find a way back\ninto the detention block?\nHAN\nI'm not going anywhere.\nLUKE\nThey're going to execute her. Look,\na few minutes ago you said you didn't\nwant to just wait here to be captured.\nNow all you want to do is stay.\nHAN\nMarching into the detention area is\nnot what I had in mind.\nLUKE\nBut they're going to kill her!\nHAN\nBetter her than me...\nLUKE\nShe's rich.\nChewbacca growls.\nHAN\nRich?\nLUKE\nYes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you\nwere to rescue her, the reward would\nbe...\nHAN\nWhat?\nLUKE\nWell more wealth that you can imagine.\nHAN\nI don't know, I can imagine quite a\nbit!\nLUKE\nYou'll get it!\nHAN\nI better!\nLUKE\nYou will...\nHAN\nAll right, kid. But you'd better be\nright about this.\nHan looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.\nLUKE\nAll right.\nHAN\nWhat's your plan?\nLUKE\nUh... Threepio, hand me those binders\nthere will you?\nLuke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.\nLUKE\nOkay. Now, I'm going to put these on\nyou.\nChewie lets out a hideous growl.\nLUKE\nOkay. Han, you put these on.\nLuke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.\nHAN\nDon't worry, Chewie. I think I know\nwhat he has in mind.\nThe Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as\nHan binds him with the electronic cuffs.\nTHREEPIO\nMaster Luke, sir! Pardon me for\nasking... but, ah... what should\nArtoo and I do if we're discovered\nhere?\nLUKE\nLock the door!\nHAN\nAnd hope they don't have blasters.\nTHREEPIO\nThat isn't very reassuring.\nLuke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and\nstart off into the giant Imperial Death Star.\n\nHan and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits\nas they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops,\nbureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio\ncompletely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious\nglance.\nFinally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.\nLUKE\nI can't see a thing in this helmet.\nA bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away\nby Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and\nthe elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.\n\nSeveral Imperial officers walk through the wide main\npassageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot\nsimilar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end\nof the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then\ndisappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting\nthat it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion.\nNo one in the hallway seems to notice him.\n\nAREA\nLuke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door\nslides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards\nenter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates\nare everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.\nHAN\nThis is not going to work.\nLUKE\nWhy didn't you say so before?\nHAN\nI did say so before!\n\nLuke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door\naway with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees\nthe dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping\nand is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on\nher face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands\nstaring at her with his mouth hanging open.\nLEIA\n(finally)\nAren't you a little short to be a\nstormtrooper?\nLuke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.\nLUKE\nWhat? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke\nSkywalker. I'm here to rescue you.\nLEIA\nYou're who?\nLUKE\nI'm here to rescue you. I've got\nyour R2 unit. I'm here with Ben\nKenobi.\nLEIA\nBen Kenobi is here! Where is he?\nLUKE\nCome on!\n\nDarth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the\nfar end of the conference table.\nVADER\nHe is here...\nTARKIN\nObi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think\nso?\nVADER\nA tremor in the Force. The last time\nI felt it was in the presence of my\nold master.\nTARKIN\nSurely he must be dead by now.\nVADER\nDon't underestimate the power of the\nForce.\nTARKIN\nThe Jedi are extinct, their fire has\ngone out of the universe. You, my\nfriend, are all that's left of their\nreligion.\nThere is a quiet buzz on the comlink.\nTARKIN\nYes.\nINTERCOM VOICE\nGovernor Tarkin, we have an emergency\nalert in detention block A A-twenty-\nthree.\nTARKIN\nThe princess! Put all sections on\nalert!\nVADER\nObi-Wan is here. The Force is with\nhim.\nTARKIN\nIf you're right, he must not be\nallowed to escape.\nVADER\nEscape is not his plan. I must face\nhim alone.\n\nAn ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the\nelevator door.\nHAN\nChewie!\nChewbacca responds with a growling noise.\nHAN\nGet behind me! Get behind me!\nA series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door\nthrough which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.\nHan and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke\nand flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting\nup with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.\nHAN\nCan't get out that way.\nLEIA\nLooks like you managed to cut off\nour only escape route.\nHAN\n(sarcastically)\nMaybe you'd like it back in your\ncell, Your Highness.\nLuke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they\ncontinue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their\nway down the corridor.\nLUKE\nSee-Threepio! See-Threepio!\nTHREEPIO\n(over comlink)\nYes sir?\nLUKE\nWe've been cut off! Are there any\nother ways out of the cell bay?...\nWhat was that? I didn't copy!\n\nThreepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and\nwhistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink\ntransmitter.\nTHREEPIO\nI said, all systems have been alerted\nto your presence, sir. The main\nentrance seems to be the only way in\nor out; all other information on\nyour level is restricted.\nSomeone begins banging on the door.\nTROOPER VOICE\nOpen up in there!\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no!\n\nLuke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as\nthey continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca\nare barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far\nand of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke\nfills the narrow cell corridor.\nLUKE\nThere isn't any other way out.\nHAN\nI can't hold them off forever! Now\nwhat?\nLEIA\nThis is some rescue. When you came\nin here, didn't you have a plan for\ngetting out?\nHAN\n(pointing to Luke)\nHe's the brains, sweetheart.\nLuke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.\nLUKE\nWell, I didn't...\nThe princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in\nthe wall next to Han, almost frying him.\nHAN\nWhat the hell are you doing?\nLEIA\nSomebody has to save our skins. Into\nthe garbage chute, wise guy.\nShe jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca\nlook on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and\nsays something.\nHAN\nGet in there you big furry oaf! I\ndon't care what you smell! Get in\nthere and don't worry about it.\nHan gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the\ntiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their\nway toward the opening.\nHAN\nWonderful girl! Either I'm going to\nkill her or I'm beginning to like\nher. Get in there!\nLuke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires\noff a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then\nslides into the chute himself and is gone.\n\nHan tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.\nLuke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He\nfinds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't\nbudge.\nHAN\n(sarcastically)\nOh! The garbage chute was a really\nwonderful idea. What an incredible\nsmell you've discovered! Let's get\nout of here! Get away from there...\nLUKE\nNo! wait!\nHan draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The\nlaserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.\nEveryone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes\nalmost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a\nrather grim look on her face.\nLUKE\nWill you forget it? I already tried\nit. It's magnetically sealed!\nLEIA\nPut that thing away! You're going to\nget us all killed.\nHAN\nAbsolutely, Your Worship. Look, I\nhad everything under control until\nyou led us down here. You know, it's\nnot going to take them long to figure\nout what happened to us.\nLEIA\nIt could be worse...\nA loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the\nmurky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins\nto back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols\ndrawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.\nHAN\nIt's worse.\nLUKE\nThere's something alive in here!\nHAN\nThat's your imagination.\nLUKE\nSomething just moves past my leg!\nLook! Did you see that?\nHAN\nWhat?\nLUKE\nHelp!\nSuddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.\nHAN\nLuke! Luke! Luke!\nSolo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air\nand thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around\nhis throat.\nLEIA\nLuke!\nLeia extends a long pipe toward him.\nLEIA\nLuke, Luke, grab a hold of this.\nLUKE\nBlast it, will you! My gun's jammed.\nHAN\nWhere?\nLUKE\nAnywhere! Oh!!\nSolo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the\nmuck by the slimy tentacle.\nHAN\nLuke! Luke!\nSuddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and\nmove in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.\nHan and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca\nhowls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke\nsuddenly bobs to the surface.\nLEIA\nGrab him!\nLuke seems to be released by the thing.\nLEIA\nWhat happened?\nLUKE\nI don't know, it just let go of me\nand disappeared...\nHAN\nI've got a very bad feeling about\nthis.\nBefore anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and\nedge toward the Rebels.\nLUKE\nThe walls are moving!\nLEIA\nDon't just stand there. Try to brace\nit with something.\nThey place poles and long metal beams between the closing\nwalls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant\ntrashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.\nLUKE\nWait a minute!\nLuke pulls out his comlink.\nLUKE\nThreepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio!\nWhere could he be?\n\nA soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for\nSee-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which\nis sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and\nThreepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great\nexplosion and the door of the control tower flies across the\nfloor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.\nFIRST TROOPER\nTake over!\n(pointing to the dead\nofficer)\nSee to him! Look there!\nA trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides\nopen. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows\nhis bronze companion out into the office.\nTHREEPIO\nThey're madmen! They're heading for\nthe prison level. If you hurry, you\nmight catch them.\nFIRST OFFICER\n(to his troops)\nFollow me! You stand guard.\nThe troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to\nwatch over the command office.\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nCome on!\nThe guard aims a blaster at them.\nTHREEPIO\nOh! All this excitement has overrun\nthe circuits of my counterpart here.\nIf you don't mind, I'd like to take\nhim down to maintenance.\nTROOPER\nAll right.\nThe guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries\nout the door.\n\nAs the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.\nChewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his\ngiant paws.\nHan is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is\nsnapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.\nLUKE\nThreepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!\nHan and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole.\nLeia begins to sink into the trash.\nHAN\nGet to the top!\nLEIA\nI can't\nLUKE\nWhere could he be? Threepio! Threepio,\nwill you come in?\n\nTHREEPIO\nThey aren't here! Something must\nhave happened to them. See if they've\nbeen captured.\nLittle Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall\nsocket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from\nthe tiny robot.\nTHREEPIO\nHurry!\n\nThe walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against\nthe walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each\nother. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds\nit tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels\nthe first crushing pressure against her body.\nHAN\nOne thing's for sure. We're all going\nto be a lot thinner!\n(to Leia)\nGet on top of it!\nLEIA\nI'm trying!\n\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nThank goodness, they haven't found\nthem! Where could they be?\nArtoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.\nTHREEPIO\nUse the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I\nturned it off!\n\nMeanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his\nhead above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz\nand he rips it off his belt.\n\nMuffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard,\nbut not distinctly.\nTHREEPIO\nAre you there, sir?\n\nLUKE\nThreepio!\n\nTHREEPIO\nWe've had some problems...\nLUKE\n(over comlink)\nWill you shut up and listen to me?\nShut down all garbage mashers on the\ndetention level, will you? Do you\ncopy?\n\nLUKE\nShut down all the garbage mashers on\nthe detention level.\n\nLUKE\n(over comlink)\nShut down all the garbage mashers on\nthe detention level.\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nNo. Shut them all down! Hurry!\nThreepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible\nscreaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.\nTHREEPIO\nListen to them! They're dying, Artoo!\nCurse my metal body! I wasn't fast\nenough. It's all my fault! My poor\nmaster!\nLUKE\n(over comlink)\nThreepio, we're all right!\n\nThe screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief.\nThe walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace\nin the background.\nLUKE\nWe're all right. You did great.\nLuke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a\nnumber.\nLUKE\nHey... hey, open the pressure\nmaintenance hatch on unit number...\nwhere are we?\n\nHAN\n(over comlink)\nThree-two-six-eight-two-seven.\n\nBen enters a humming service trench that powers the huge\ntractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep.\nThe clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard.\nThe old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading\nto a control panel that connects two large cables. He\ncarefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal,\nand several lights on the board go from red to blue.\n\nThe group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.\nHan and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster\nbelts.\nHAN\nIf we can just avoid any more female\nadvice, we ought to be able to get\nout of here.\nLuke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster\nfrom Solo.\nLUKE\nWell, let's get moving!\nChewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage\nroom, as he runs away and then stops howling.\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nWhere are you going?\nThe Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy\ntentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a\nvictim. Han aims his pistol.\nLEIA\nNo, wait. They'll hear!\nHan fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes\nrelentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply\nshakes his head in disgust.\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nCome here, you big coward!\nChewie shakes his head \"no.\"\nHAN\nChewie! Come here!\nLEIA\nListen. I don't know who you are, or\nwhere you came from, but from now\non, you do as I tell you. Okay?\nHan is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.\nHAN\nLook, Your Worshipfulness, let's get\none thing straight! I take orders\nfrom one person! Me!\nLEIA\nIt's a wonder you're still alive.\n(looking at Chewie)\nWill somebody get this big walking\ncarpet out of my way?\nHan watches her start away. He looks at Luke.\nHAN\nNo reward is worth this.\nThey follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.\n\nSuddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of\nstormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly\nslips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few\nfeet of him.\nOFFICER\nSecure this area until the alert is\ncanceled.\nFIRST TROOPER\nGive me regular reports.\nAll but two of the stormtroopers leave.\nFIRST TROOPER\nDo you know what's going on?\nSECOND TROOPER\nMaybe it's another drill.\nBen moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers\nas they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand\ntoward them, as the troops think they hear something in the\nother hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips\npast the troopers and into the main hallway.\nSECOND TROOPER\nWhat was that?\nFIRST TROOPER\nOh, it's nothing. Don't worry about\nit.\n\nLuke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and\nstop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers\nare milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.\nHAN\n(looking at his ship)\nThere she is.\nLUKE\nSee-Threepio, do you copy?\nTHREEPIO\n(voice)\nFor the moment. Uh, we're in the\nmain hangar across from the ship.\nLUKE\nWe're right above you. Stand by.\nHan is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of\nthe pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and\npoints out the window to the ship.\nLEIA\nYou came in that thing? You're braver\nthat I thought.\nHAN\nNice! Come on!\nHan gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the\nhallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty\nImperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are\ntaken by surprise and stop in their tracks.\nFIRST TROOPER\nIt's them! Blast them!\nBefore even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges\nthe troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the\nstormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down\nthe corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.\nHAN\n(to Luke and Leia)\nGet back to the ship!\nLUKE\nWhere are you going? Come back!\nHan has already rounded a corner and does not hear.\nLEIA\nHe certainly has courage.\nLUKE\nWhat good will it do us if he gets\nhimself killed? Come on!\nLuke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for\nmuted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke\nand Leia start off toward the starship hangar.\n\nHan chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is\nyelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a\ndead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few\nfeet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops\nbegin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are\nmoving into an attack position in front of the lone\nstarpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops\nbegin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.\n\nChewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt\nto save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of\nlaser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate\nextraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of\nfurious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running\nthe other way also.\n\nLuke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down\na narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They\nquickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an\nopen hatchway.\n\nLuke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge\nthat spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity.\nThe bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft,\nand Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance\noff the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of\nhis arm and pulls him back.\nLUKE\n(gasping)\nI think we took a wrong turn.\nBlasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby\nreminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at\nthe advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch\nthat pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving\nthem precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.\nLaserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.\nLEIA\nThere's no lock!\nLuke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.\nLUKE\nThat oughta hold it for a while.\nLEIA\nQuick, we've got to get across. Find\nthe control that extends the bridge.\nLUKE\nOh, I think I just blasted it.\nLuke looks at the blasted bridge control while the\nstormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making\nominous drilling and pounding sounds.\nLEIA\nThey're coming through!\nLuke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when\nlaserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol\nat a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across\nthe abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops\nappear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit,\nand grabs at his chest.\nAnother trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by\nLuke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move\nback off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.\nLUKE\nHere, hold this.\nLuke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt.\nIt has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge\noverhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the\nrope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears\nand fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.\nSuddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet\nof more troops.\nLEIA\nHere they come!\nLeia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and\nhe falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the\ngorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He\ntugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the\nprincess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him\nquickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.\nLEIA\nFor luck!\nLuke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss\nto the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as\nLuke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the\nstormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at\nthe escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into\nthe tiny subhallway.\n\nBen hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several\nstormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks\nto make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the\nopposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of\nthe hallway and starts after the old Jedi.\n\nThreepio looks around at the troops milling about the\npirateship entry ramp.\nTHREEPIO\nWhere could they be?\nArtoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left\nand right, beeping a response.\n\nHan and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several\ntroopers hot on their trail.\nTROOPER\nClose the blast doors!\nAt the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in\nfront of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion\nrace past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage\nto get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops\nbefore the doors slam shut.\nTROOPER\nOpen the blast doors! Open the blast\ndoors!\n\nBen hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar\nwhere the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar,\nDarth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not\nten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his\nand steps slowly forward.\nVADER\nI've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.\nWe meet again, at last. The circle\nis now complete.\nBen Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive\nposition. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.\nVADER\nWhen I left you, I was but the\nlearner; now I am the master.\nBEN\nOnly a master of evil, Darth.\nThe two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few\nmoments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right\nmoment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain,\nas if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He\nshakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.\nBen makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked\nby a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke\nby Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's\nblows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark\nLord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar.\nThe two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments\nwith laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing\nsound.\nVADER\nYour powers are weak, old man.\nBEN\nYou can't win, Darth. If you strike\nme down, I shall become more powerful\nthan you can possibly imagine.\nTheir lightsabers continue to meet in combat.\n\nHan Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back\nagainst the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the\nImperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.\nHAN\nDidn't we just leave this party?\nChewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.\nHAN\nWhat kept you?\nLEIA\nWe ran into some old friends.\nLUKE\nIs the ship all right?\nHAN\nSeems okay, if we can get to it.\nJust hope the old man got the tractor\nbeam out of commission.\n\nVader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they\nhit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact.\nTroopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord\nof The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his\ngroup's vantage point.\nLUKE\nLook!\nLuke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader\nemerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking\nbay.\n\nThreepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's\nImperial docking bay.\nTHREEPIO\nCome on, Artoo, we're going!\nThreepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who\nwere guarding the starship rush past them heading towards\nBen and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.\n\nSolo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The\ntroops rush toward the battling knights.\nHAN\nNow's our chance! Go!\nThey start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops\ncharging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader\ntakes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings\nhis mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to\ndeflect the blow and swiftly turns around.\nThe old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts\nhis sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene\nlook on his face.\nVader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's\ncloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.\nVader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the\nempty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers\nand the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two\nand starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.\nLUKE\nNo!\nThe stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.\nThe robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium\nFalcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns\ntheir fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and\nadvances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.\nHAN\n(to Luke)\nCome on!\nLEIA\nCome on! Luke, its too late!\nHAN\nBlast the door! Kid!\nLuke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it\nexplodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge\nforward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close\nbehind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the\ndocking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his\nonrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops,\nas Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He\nfires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.\nBEN'S VOICE\nRun, Luke! Run!\nLuke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns\ntoward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the\ntroopers and races into the ship.\n\nDarth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is\nwatching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.\nTARKIN\nAre they away?\nVADER\nThey have just made the jump into\nhyperspace.\nTARKIN\nYou're sure the homing beacon is\nsecure aboard their ship? I'm taking\nan awful risk, Vader. This had better\nwork.\n\nGrand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their\ndiscussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer\nthe call.\nTARKIN\nYes.\nDEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE\nWe are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a\nmoon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.\n\nTarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with\ninterest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another\non the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and\nthe forth moon.\nDEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE\nOrbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the\nRebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.\nVADER\nThis will be a day long remembered.\nIt has seen the end of Kenobi and it\nwill soon see the end of the\nRebellion.\n\nAlarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo-\npowered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate\nthe huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting\ndevices.\n\nTechnical crews scurry here and there loading last-minute\narmaments and unlocking power cables.\n\nLuke's ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges\nof his wings slightly scorched.\n\nRebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface\nwith laserbolts.\n\nWalls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in\nall directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.\nStanding in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and\nforeboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes\nup to him.\nASTRO-OFFICER\nWe count thirty Rebel ships, Lord\nVader. But they're so small they're\nevading our turbo-lasers!\nVADER\nWe'll have to destroy them ship to\nship. Get the crews to their fighters.\n\nSmoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their\nturbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes\nabout preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head\ngear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming\nnoise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet\nwith his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.\n\nLuke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon\nand down onto the dim grey surface.\n\nThe Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers\nhis craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from\nthe surface towards the heavens.\n\nThe thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout\nthe massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke\nand chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of\nexplosions.\n\nImperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small\nauxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters.\n\nSilhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star horizon,\nfour ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the Rebel fighters.\nTwo of the TIE fighters peel off and drop out of frame. Pan\nwith the remaining two TIE ships.\n\nDarth Vader strides purposefully down a Death Star corridor,\nflanked by Imperial stormtroopers.\nVADER\nSeveral fighters have broken off\nfrom the main group. Come with me!\n\nLuke's ship soars closer to the surface of the Death Star,\nan Imperial TIE fighter closing in on him in hot pursuit.\n\nWedge dives across the horizon toward Luke and the TIE\nfighter.\n\nThree Y-wing skim the Death Star surface deep in the trench,\nas laserbolts streak past on all sides.\n\nAn exterior surface gun blazes away at the oncoming Rebel\nfighters.\n\nThe three Y-wing fighters race toward camera and zoom overhead\nthrough a hail of laserfire.\n\nThe three TIE fighters race along in the trench in a tight\nformation.\n\nGold Leader explodes in a ball of flames, throwing debris in\nall directions.\n\nOne of the engines explodes on Gold Five's Y-wing fighter,\nblazing out of control. He dives past the horizon toward the\nDeath Star's surface, passing a TIE fighter during his\ndescent. Gold Five, a veteran of countless campaigns, spins\ntoward his death.\n\nGrant Moff Tarkin and a Chief Officer stand in the Death\nStar's control room.\nOFFICER\nWe've analyzed their attack, sir,\nand there is a danger. Should I have\nyour ship standing by?\nTARKIN\nEvacuate? In out moment of triumph?\nI think you overestimate their\nchances!\nTarkin turns to the computer readout screen. Flames move\naround the green disk at the center of the screen, as numbers\nread across the bottom.\nVOICE\n(over speaker)\nRebel base, three minutes and closing.\n\nTwo X-wings move across the surface of the Death Star. Red\nLeader's X-wing drops down to the surface leading to the\nexhaust port.\n\nA huge remote-control laser cannon fires at the approaching\nRebel fighters.\n\nThe Rebel fighters evade the Imperial laser blasts.\n\nFrom the cockpits of the Rebel pilots, the surface of the\nDeath Star streaks by, with Imperial laserfire shooting toward\nthem.\n\nThree TIE fighters, Vader flanked by two wingmen, dive in a\ntight formation. The sun reflects off their dominate solar\nfins as they loop toward the Death Star's surface.\n\nRed Leader's X-wing moves up the Death Star trench.\n\nThe three TIE fighters move in formation across the Death\nStar surface.\n\nVader and his wingmen zoom down the trench.\n\nVader and his wingmen whip through the trench in pursuit of\nthe Rebel fighters.\n\nAn armed Imperial stormtrooper is knocked to the floor from\nthe attack explosion. Other troopers scurrying about the\ncorridors are knocked against the wall and lose their balance.\n\nGrand Moff Tarkin casts a sinister eye at the computer screen.\nDEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE\nRebel base, one minute and closing.\n\nThe Death Star laser cannon slowly rotates as it shoots\nlaserbolts.\n\nLuke's X-wing streaks through the trench, firing lasers.\n\nTwo laser cannons are firing on the Rebel fighters.\n\nBiggs' ship bursts into a million flaming bits and scatters\nacross the surface.\n\nGrand Moff Tarkin watches the projected target screen with\nsatisfaction.\nDEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE\nRebel base, thirty seconds and\nclosing.\n\nLuke's ship streaks through the trench of the Death Star.\n\nThree TIE fighters charge away down the trench toward Luke.\n\nLuke's ship charges down the trench.\n\nThe Death Star trench zooms by.\n\nLuke's fighter streaks through the trench.\n\nVader follows Luke's X-wing down the trench.\n\nLuke's ship streaks ever close to the exhaust port.\n\nThe three TIE fighters, manned by Vader and his two wingmen,\nfollow Luke's X-wing down the trench.\n\nTarkin glares at the projected target screen.\nDEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE\nRebel base, in range.\nTARKIN\nYou may fire when ready.\nDEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE\nCommence primary ignition.\nAn officer reaches up and pushes buttons on the control panel,\nas green lighted buttons turn to red.\n\nThe three TIE fighters zoom down the Death Star trench in\npursuit of Luke, never breaking formation.\n\nLuke's ship barrels down the trench.\n\nThe three TIE fighters move in on Luke. As Vader's center\nfighter unleashes a volley of laserfire, one of the TIE ships\nat his side is hit and explodes into flame. The two remaining\nships continue to move in.\n\nVader's wingman panics at the sight of the oncoming pirate\nstarship and veers radically to one side, colliding with\nVader's TIE fighter in the process. Vader's wingman crashes\ninto the side wall of the trench and explodes. Vader's damaged\nship spins out of the trench with a damaged wing.\n\nSolo's ship moves in toward the Death Star trench.\n\nLuke's torpedoes shoot toward the port and seems to simply\ndisappear into the surface and not explode. But the shots do\nfind their mark and have gone into the exhaust port and are\nheading for the main reactor.\n\nAn Imperial soldier runs to the control panel board and pulls\nthe attack lever as the board behind him lights up.\nINTERCOM VOICE\nStand by to fire at Rebel base.\n\nSeveral Imperial soldiers, flanking a pensive Grand Moff\nTarkin, busily push control levers and buttons.\nINTERCOM VOICE\nStanding by.\nThe rumble of a distant explosion begins.\n\nSuddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft.\nWhen Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.\n\nLuke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.\nHe slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet\nhit a circular grill and knock it open.  Luke claws at the surface of\nthe pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.\n\nOperators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits\nswitches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death\nStar, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible\ndeflector shield.\nA control officer rushes over to the shield operator.\nOFFICER\nInform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.\nOPERATOR\nYes, sir.\nThe control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial\nshuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial\nstormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.\n\nThe DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat,\nstrides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp.\nThe troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival.\nBut the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.\nThe exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only\ndarkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this\nblack void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the\nassemblage as he walks down the ramp.\nJERJERROD\nLord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your\npresence.\nVADER\nYou may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you\nback on\nschedule.\nThe commander turns ashen and begins to shake.\nJERJERROD\nI assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.\nVADER\nPerhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.\nJERJERROD\nI tell you, this station will be operational as planned.\nVADER\nThe Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.\nJERJERROD\nBut he asks the impossible. I need more men.\nVADER\nThen perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.\nJERJERROD\t (aghast)\nThe Emperor's coming here?\nVADER\nThat is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your\napparent lack of progress.\nJERJERROD\nWe shall double our efforts.\nVADER\nI hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as\nI am.\n\nLord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous\nDeath Star commander.\n\nDarth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private\nelevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.\nGUARD\nHalt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.\nVADER\n(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the\nForce)\nThe Emperor will see me, now!\nGUARD\n(repeating Vader's command)\nThe Emperor will see you, now.\n\nThe elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk\nacross the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side\nby side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.\nEMPEROR\nWelcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.\nLuke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down\nat Luke's binders.\nEMPEROR\nYou no longer need those.\nThe Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders\nfall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands,\nfree now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.\nEMPEROR\nGuards, leave us.\nThe red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.\nEMPEROR\t (to Luke)\nI'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call\nme Master.\nLUKE\nYou're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.\nThe Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke.\nThe Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can\nperceive the evil visage within the hood.\nEMPEROR\nOh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are\nmistaken...about a great many things.\nVADER\nHis lightsaber.\nVader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's\nlightsaber. The Emperor takes it.\nEMPEROR\nAh, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know\nyour father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with\nyou.\nLUKE\nYou're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.\nThe Emperor laughs.\nEMPEROR\nPerhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.\nLuke looks up sharply.\nEMPEROR\nYes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.\nVader looks at Luke.\nLUKE\nYour overconfidence is your weakness.\nEMPEROR\nYour faith in your friends is yours.\nVADER\nIt is pointless to resist, my son.\nThe Emperor turns to face Luke.\nEMPEROR\t (angry)\nEverything that has transpired has done so according to my design.\n(indicates Endor)\nYour friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...\nLuke reacts. The Emperor notes it.\nEMPEROR\t (cont)\n...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who\nallowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It\nis quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my\nbest troops awaits them.\nLuke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword\nin the Emperor's hand.\nEMPEROR\nOh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when\nyour friends arrive.\n\nThrough the round window behind the Emperor's throne can be seen the\ndistant flashes of the space battle in progress.\nEMPEROR\nCome, boy. See for yourself.\nThe Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side.\nLuke moves to look through a small section of the window.\nEMPEROR\nFrom here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and\nthe end of your insignificant Rebellion.\nLuke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest\nof the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the\nlightsaber.\nEMPEROR\nYou want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your\nJedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to\nyour anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my\nservant.\nVader watches Luke in his agony.\nLUKE\nNo!\nEMPEROR\nIt is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now\nmine!\n\nControllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod stands\nover them.\nJERJERROD\nFire!\n\nA button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded\nImperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A huge beam of\nlight emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers stand to one side\nat a control panel.\n\nThe giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star begins to\nglow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle.\n\nChaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions as\nthe Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading\na heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and\ndesperate to escape.\nIn the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous\ndeadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle.\nFinally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions grow louder as\nVader draws him closer.\nVADER\t (a whisper)\nLuke, help me take this mask off.\nLURE\nBut you'll die.\nVADER\nNothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my\nown eyes.\nSlowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There\nbeneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the\ndying man smiles at the sight before him.\nANAKIN\t (very weak)\nNow...go, my son. Leave me.\nLUKE\nNo. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save\nyou.\nANAKIN\nYou already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you\nwere right.\nLUKE\nFather...I won't leave you.\nDarth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.\nA huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half\ncarrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a\nshuttle.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense\nsuperstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel Star Cruisers\noutside continually bombard the huge station. And each direct hit is\nanswered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station\nitself.\n\nAn Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out of the\nmain docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star is blown\naway.\nFinally, just as it looks like the Falcon will not make it, Lando\nexpertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and\nwhizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon, only a moment before the Death Star\nsupernovas into oblivion.",
  "Mos Eisley": "As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien\nwith a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side.

As a matter of fact, I\nwas just going to see your boss.\nTell Jabba that I've got his money.\nHan sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the\ngun on him.\nGREEDO\nIt's too late. You should have paid\nhim when you had the chance. Jabba's\nput a price on your head, so large\nthat every bounty hunter in the galaxy\nwill be looking for you. I'm lucky I\nfound you first.\nHAN\nYeah, but this time I got the money.\nGREEDO\nIf you give it to me, I might forget\nI found you.\nHAN\nI don't have it with me.

  "Docking Bay 94": "Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple\ncreatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is\nthe grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is\na grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is\na fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and\na huge ugly mouth.\nJABBA\nCome on out, Solo!\nA voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and\nthey turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee,\nChewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.\nHAN\nI've been waiting for you, Jabba.\nJABBA\nI expected you would be.\nHAN\nI'm not the type to run.\nJABBA\n(fatherly-smooth)\nHan, my boy, there are times when\nyou disappoint me... why haven't you\npaid me?

If you disappoint me again,\nI'll put a price on your head so\nlarge you won't be able to go near a\ncivilized system for the rest of\nyour short life.\nHAN\nJabba, I'll pay you because it's my\npleasure.\n\nChewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay\n94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.\nChewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry.\nThe darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder\nlot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small\ntransmitter.",
  "Mos Eisley Spaceport": "Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is\nDocking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a\nlarge, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that\ncould only loosely be called a starship.\nLUKE\nWhat a piece of junk.\nThe tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.\nHAN\nShe'll make point five beyond the\nspeed of light. She may not look\nlike much, but she's got it where it\ncounts, kid. I've added some special\nmodifications myself.\nLuke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about\nall this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others\nto follow.\nHAN\nWe're a little rushed, so if you'll\nhurry aboard we'll get out of here.\nThe group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han\nSolo.\n\nLuke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium\nFalcon passing Solo.\nTHREEPIO\nHello, sir.\n\nThe troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the\ndocking bay entrance.\nTROOPER\nStop that ship!\nHan Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing\ninto the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as\nhe ducks into the spaceship.\nTROOPER\nBlast 'em!\nHan draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots\nwhich force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The\npirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that\nslams the overhead entry shut.",
  "Millennium Falcon": "Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty\nengines of the starship.\n\nHAN\nChewie, get us out of here!\nThe group straps in for take off.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, my. I'd forgotten how much I\nhate space travel.\n\nHan climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who\nchatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.\n\nHan frantically types information into the ship's computer.\nLittle Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway,\nmakes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.\nHAN\nIt looks like an Imperial cruiser.\nOur passengers must be hotter than I\nthought. Try and hold them off. Angle\nthe deflector shield while I make\nthe calculations for the jump to\nlight speed.\n\nOver the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy\nspread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the\ncramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.\nHAN\nStay sharp! There are two more coming\nin; they're going to try to cut us\noff.\nLUKE\nWhy don't you outrun them? I thought\nyou said this thing was fast.\nHAN\nWatch your mouth, kid, or you're\ngoing to find yourself floating home.\nWe'll be safe enough once we make\nthe jump to hyperspace. Besides, I\nknow a few maneuvers. We'll lose\nthem!\n\nThe ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.\nHAN\nHere's where the fun begins!\nBEN\nHow long before you can make the\njump to light speed?\nHAN\nIt'll take a few moments to get the\ncoordinates from the navi-computer.\nThe ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.\nLUKE\nAre you kidding? At the rate they're\ngaining...\nHAN\nTraveling through hyperspace isn't\nlike dusting crops, boy! Without\nprecise calculations we could fly\nright through a star or bounce too\nclose to a supernova and that'd end\nyour trip real quick, wouldn't it?\nThe ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red\nwarning light begins to flash.\nLUKE\nWhat's that flashing?\nHAN\nWe're losing our deflector shield.\nGo strap yourself in, I'm going to\nmake the jump to light speed.\nThe galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if\ncrashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship\nmakes the jump to hyperspace.\n\nBen watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small \"seeker\"\nrobot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters,\nseems almost faint.\nLUKE\nAre you all right? What's wrong?\nBEN\nI felt a great disturbance in the\nForce... as if millions of voices\nsuddenly cried out in terror and\nwere suddenly silenced. I fear\nsomething terrible has happened.\nBen rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then\nhe fixes his gaze on Luke.\nBEN\nYou'd better get on with your\nexercises.\nHan Solo enters the room.\nHAN\nWell, you can forget your troubles\nwith those Imperial slugs. I told\nyou I'd outrun 'em.\nLuke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.\nHAN\nDon't everyone thank me at once.\nThreepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a\ngame in which three-dimensional holographic figures move\nalong a chess-type board.\nHAN\nAnyway, we should be at Alderaan\nabout oh-two-hundred hours.\nChewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table\ncovered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the\ntable has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca\nseems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur-\ncovered arms over his head.\nTHREEPIO\nNow be careful, Artoo.\nArtoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his\nstubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures\nto walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's\nface and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.\nThreepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and\nbegins to argue with the huge Wookiee.\nTHREEPIO\nHe made a fair move. Screaming about\nit won't help you.\nHAN\n(interrupting)\nLet him have it. It's not wise to\nupset a Wookiee.\nTHREEPIO\nBut sir, nobody worries about\nupsetting a droid.\nHAN\nThat's 'cause droids don't pull\npeople's arms out of their socket\nwhen they lose. Wookiees are known\nto do that.\nTHREEPIO\nI see your point, sir. I suggest a\nnew strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee\nwin.\nLuke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems\nfrozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his\nhead. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.\nHan watches with a bit of smugness.\nBEN\nRemember, a Jedi can feel the Force\nflowing through him.\nLUKE\nYou mean it controls your actions?\nBEN\nPartially. But it also obeys your\ncommands.\nSuspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a\n\"seeker\", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae,\nhovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of\nthe youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift\nlunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't\nmove and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy,\nthen makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood\nred laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing\nhim to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.\nHAN\nHokey religions and ancient weapons\nare no match for a good blaster at\nyour side, kid.\nLUKE\nYou don't believe in the Force, do\nyou?\nHAN\nKid, I've flown from one side of\nthis galaxy to the other. I've seen\na lot of strange stuff, but I've\nnever seen anything to make me believe\nthere's one all-powerful force\ncontrolling everything. There's no\nmystical energy field that controls\nmy destiny.\nBen smiles quietly.\nHAN\nIt's all a lot of simple tricks and\nnonsense.\nBEN\nI suggest you try it again, Luke.\nBen places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his\neyes.\nBEN\nThis time, let go your conscious\nself and act on instinct.\nLUKE\n(laughing)\nWith the blast shield down, I can't\neven see. How am I supposed to fight?\nBEN\nYour eyes can deceive you. Don't\ntrust them.\nHan skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker\ninto the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then\ndrops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly\nmissing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits\nLuke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful\nyell and attempts to hit the seeker.\nBEN\nStretch out with your feelings.\nLuke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes\na dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the\nbolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original\nposition.\nBEN\nYou see, you can do it.\nHAN\nI call it luck.\nBEN\nIn my experience, there's no such\nthing as luck.\nHAN\nLook, going good against remotes is\none thing. Going good against the\nliving? That's something else.\nSolo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the\ncontrol panel.\nHAN\nLooks like we're coming up on\nAlderaan.\nHan and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.\nLUKE\nYou know, I did feel something. I\ncould almost see the remote.\nBEN\nThat's good. You have taken your\nfirst step into a larger world.\n\nHAN\nStand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in\nthe sublight engines.\nHan pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window\nstars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then\nstop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently\nshake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering\nthe sides of the ship.\nHAN\nWhat the...? Aw, we've come out of\nhyperspace into a meteor shower.\nSome kind of asteroid collision.\nIt's not on any of the charts.\nThe Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool\nin the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing\ncockpit.\nLUKE\nWhat's going on?\nHAN\nOur position is correct, except...\nno, Alderaan!\nLUKE\nWhat do you mean? Where is it?\nHAN\nThats what I'm trying to tell you,\nkid. It ain't there. It's been totally\nblown away.\nLUKE\nWhat? How?\nBen moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to\nsettle down.\nBEN\nDestroyed... by the Empire!\nHAN\nThe entire starfleet couldn't destroy\nthe whole planet. It'd take a thousand\nships with more fire power than\nI've...\nA signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled\nalarm starts humming.\nHAN\nThere's another ship coming in.\nLUKE\nMaybe they know what happened.\nBEN\nIt's an Imperial fighter.\nChewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside\nthe cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned\nImperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.\nLUKE\nIt followed us!\nBEN\nNo. It's a short range fighter.\nHAN\nThere aren't any bases around here.\nWhere did it come from?\n\nLUKE\nIt sure is leaving in a big hurry.\nIf they identify us, we're in big\ntrouble.\nHAN\nNot if I can help it. Chewie...jam\nit's transmissions.\nBEN\nIt'd be as well to let it go. It's\ntoo far out of range.\nHAN\nNot for long...\n\nThe tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny\nfighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter\nuntil it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben\nstands behind Chewbacca.\nBEN\nA fighter that size couldn't get\nthis deep into space on its own.\nLUKE\nIt must have gotten lost, been part\nof a convoy or something.\nHAN\nWell, he ain't going to be around\nlong enough to tell anyone about us.\n\nThe distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or\nplanet.\nLUKE\nLook at him. He's headed for that\nsmall moon.\nHAN\nI think I can get him before he gets\nthere... he's almost in range.\nThe small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous\nspherical battle station.\nBEN\nThat's no moon! It's a space station.\nHAN\nIt's too big to be a space station.\nLUKE\nI have a very bad feeling about this.\nHAN\nYeah, I think your right. Full\nreverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary\npower.\nThe pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away\ntoward the gargantuan battle station.\nLUKE\nWhy are we still moving towards it?\nHAN\nWe're caught in a tractor beam! It's\npulling us in!\nLUKE\nBut there's gotta be something you\ncan do!\nHAN\nThere's nothin' I can do about it,\nkid. I'm in full power. I'm going to\nhave to shut down. But they're not\ngoing to get me without a fight!\nBen Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.\nBEN\nYou can't win. But there are\nalternatives to fighting.\n\nAs the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome\nmetal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station\nbecomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic\nsphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which\nthe helpless pirateship is dragged.\n\nA trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In\na few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant\nofficer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly\npop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his\nhead out of a third locker.\nLUKE\nBoy, it's lucky you had these\ncompartments.\nHAN\nI use them for smuggling. I never\nthought I'd be smuggling myself in\nthem. This is ridiculous. Even if I\ncould take off, I'd never get past\nthe tractor beam.\nBEN\nLeave that to me!\nHAN\nDamn fool. I knew that you were going\nto say that!\nBEN\nWho's the more foolish... the fool\nor the fool who follows him?\nHan shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.\n\nHan pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move.\nThe dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the\nship as Chewie adjusts his controls.\nHAN\nI hope the old man got that tractor\nbeam out if commission, or this is\ngoing to be a real short trip. Okay,\nhit it!\nChewbacca growls in agreement.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking\nbay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness\nof space.\n\nLuke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off\nblankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around\nhim protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She\nsits down beside him.\n\nSolo spots approaching enemy ships.\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nWe're coming up on the sentry ships.\nHold 'em off! Angle the deflector\nshields while I charge up the main\nguns!\n\nLuke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth,\nas the princess smiles comfortingly at him.\nLUKE\nI can't believe he's gone.\nArtoo-Detoo beeps a reply.\nLEIA\nThere wasn't anything you could have\ndone.\nHan rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the\nprincess.\nHAN\n(to Luke)\nCome on, buddy, we're not out of\nthis yet!\n\nSolo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport.\n\nLuke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads\nfor the cockpit.\n\nLuke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling\ninto one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large\nrotating turrets on either side of the ship.\n\nHan adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of\nhis laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.\nHAN\n(to Luke)\nYou in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!\n\nChewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking\nTIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls\nas the ship bounces slightly.\n\nComputer graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as\nHan reaches for controls.\n\nLuke sits in readiness for the attack, his hand on the laser\ncannon's control button.\n\nChewbacca spots the enemy ships and barks.\nLEIA\n(into intercom)\nHere they come!\n\nSPACE\nThe Imperial TIE fighters move towards the Millennium Falcon,\none each veering off to the left and right of the pirateship.\n\nThe TIE fighter races past the Falcon, firing laser beams as\nit passes.\n\nThreepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo.\nThe pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in\nthe room and then comes back on.\n\nA TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and\nfires at it with the laser cannon. Luke does likewise, as\nthe fighter streaks into view. The ship has suffered a minor\nhit, and bounces slightly.\n\nLuke fires at an unseen fighter.\nLUKE\nThey're coming in too fast!\n\nThe ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the\ncockpit. The Wookiee chatters something to Leia.\n\nA laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The\nship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet\nfill of small computer chips.\nTHREEPIO\nOooh!\n\nLeia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates\nthe ship's controls.\nLEIA\nWe've lost lateral controls.\nHAN\nDon't worry, she'll hold together.\nAn enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel,\ncausing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.\nHAN\n(to ship)\nYou hear me, baby? Hold together!\nArtoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control\npanel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant\nbeeping all the while.\n\nLuke swivels in his gun mount, following the TIE fighter\nwith his laser cannon.\n\nSolo aims his laser cannon at the enemy fighter.\n\nLeia watches the TIE fighter ship fly over.\n\nLuke follows the TIE fighter across his field of view, firing\nlaserbeams from his cannon.\n\nLuke fires at a TIE fighter. At his port, Han follows a\nfighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He\nconnects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs\nvictoriously.\n\nAnother TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke,\nsmiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular\ndirect hit.\nLUKE\nGot him! I got him!\nHan turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully\nreturns.\nHAN\nGreat kid! Don't get cocky.\nHan turns back to his laser cannon.\n\nWhile Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking\nover her shoulder out the ports.\nLEIA\nThere are still two more of them out\nthere!\n\nLuke and Han look into their respective projected target\nscreens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han\nswivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser\ncannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts\nin a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his\nface.\n\nLuke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter,\nand it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke's projected\nscreen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces\nslightly as it is struck by the enemy fire.\n\nSolo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc\nof the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the\npirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon\nhits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower\nof burning fragments.\nLUKE\n(laughing)\nThat's it! We did it!\nThe princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.\nLEIA\nWe did it!\n\nThreepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled\nin the smoking, sparking wires.\nTHREEPIO\nHelp! I think I'm melting!\n(to Artoo)\nThis is all your fault.\nArtoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response.\n\nHan, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of\nthe ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the\ndamage. Leia is seated near Han.\nHAN\nNot a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You\nknow, sometimes I even amaze myself.\nLEIA\nThat doesn't sound too hard. Besides,\nthey let us go. It's the only\nexplanation for the ease of our\nescape.\nHAN\nEasy... you call that easy?\nLEIA\nTheir tracking us!\nHAN\nNot this ship, sister.\nFrustrated, Leia shakes her head.\nLEIA\nAt least the information in Artoo is\nstill intact.\nHAN\nWhat's so important? What's he\ncarrying?\nLEIA\nThe technical readouts of that battle\nstation. I only hope that when the\ndata is analyzed, a weakness can be\nfound. It's not over yet!\nHAN\nIt is for me, sister! Look, I ain't\nin this for your revolution, and I'm\nnot in it for you, Princess. I expect\nto be well paid. I'm in it for the\nmoney!\nLEIA\nYou needn't worry about your reward.\nIf money is all that you love, then\nthat's what you'll receive!\nShe angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit,\npasses Luke coming in.\nLEIA\nYour friend is quite a mercenary. I\nwonder if he really cares about\nanything... or anyone.\nLUKE\nI care!\nLuke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han\nstare out at the vast blackness of space.\nLUKE\nSo... what do you think of her, Han?\nHAN\nI'm trying not to, kid!\nLUKE\n(under his breath)\nGood...\nHAN\nStill, she's got a lot of spirit. I\ndon't know, what do you think? Do\nyou think a princess and a guy like\nme...\nLUKE\nNo!\nLuke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at\nyoung Luke's jealousy.\n\nHan and Chewbacca grin from ear to ear.\nHAN\n(yelling)\nYahoo!\n\nSolo, smiling, speaks to Luke over his headset mike.\nHAN\n(into mike)\nYou're all clear, kid.\n\nHAN\nGreat shot, kid. That was one in a\nmillion.\n\nInside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl.  Han checks as the\nship is buffeted by exploding flak.  He appears to be doing six things\nat once.\nHAN\n(harried)\nI saw them!  I saw them!\nLEIA\nSaw what?\nHAN\nStar Destroyers, two of them,\ncoming right at us.\nThreepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, sir!  Might I suggest...\nHAN\n(to Leia)\nShut him up or shut him down!\n(to Chewie)\nCheck the deflector shield!\nChewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch.\nHAN\nOh, great.  Well, we can still\noutmaneuver them.\n\nThings have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet.  Chewie\nbarks at Han.  Leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive.\nThe ship is buffeted by laser blasts.\nHAN\nPrepare to make the jump to light-\nspeed.\nTHREEPIO\nBut, sir!\nThe buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.\nLEIA\nThey're getting closer!\nHAN\n(with a gleam in his\neye)\nOh yeah?  Watch this.\nExpectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into\nhyperspace, but just sit there.\nHan and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of\nconcern.\nLEIA\nWatch what?\nHan tries again.  Still nothing.\nHAN\nI think we're in trouble.\nTHREEPIO\nIf I may say so, sir, I noticed\nearlier that the hyperdrive\nmotivator has been damaged.  It's\nimpossible to go to light-speed!\nHAN\nWe're in trouble!\nThe explosions become heavier.\n\nStars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon's window.\n\nHan works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders\nto Chewie.\nHAN\nHorizontal boosters...!\n(Chewie barks)\nAlluvial dampers...!  Well that's\nnot it.\n(Chewie barks)\nBring me the hydrospanners!\nChewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge.\nHAN\nI don't know how we're going to\nget out of this one.\nSuddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch\nradically.  Chewie barks.  The tools fall into the pit on top of Han.\nHAN\nOww!  Chewie!\nMore turbulence rocks the ship.\nHAN\nThat was no laser blast!  Something\nhit us.\nLEIA\n(over comlink)\nHan, get up here!\nHAN\nCome on, Chewie!\nHan climbs out of the hold like a shot.  Both he and Chewie run out of\nthe hold and toward the cockpit.\n\nOut the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by.\nLEIA\nAsteroids!\nHan changes places with Leia who has been at the controls, and Chewie\ngets into his chair.  Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses\nin front of the ship.\nHAN\nOh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-\none.\nLEIA\nWhat are you doing?  You're not\nactually going into an asteroid\nfield?\nHAN\nThey'd be crazy to follow us,\nwouldn't they?\nAnother asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt.\nLEIA\nYou don't have to do this to\nimpress me.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, the possibility of successfully\nnavigating an asteroid field is\napproximately three thousand, seven\nhundred and twenty to one.\nHAN\nNever tell me the odds!\n\nThe Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid.\nTwo TIE fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side.\n\nAsteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft\nthrough the dangerous field.\nLooking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid\ndrop past the window, narrowly missing their ship.\nChewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially\nclose - to close - and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch.\nThreepio's hands cover his eyes.  He manages a short peek at the\ncockpit window.  Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action.\nHan gives her a quick look.\nHAN\nYou said you wanted to be around\nwhen I made a mistake; well, this\ncould be it, sweetheart.\nLEIA\nI take it back.  We're going to\nget pulverized if we stay out here\nmuch longer.\nThe group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window.\nHAN\nI'm not going to argue with that.\nTHREEPIO\nPulverized?\nHAN\nI'm going in closer to one of\nthose big ones.\nLEIA\nCloser?\nTHREEPIO\nCloser?!\nChewbacca barks the same word, only louder.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized\nasteroids.  There is a continued display of explosions against the\nstarry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock.\nThe two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid.\nThe Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while,\nsmall asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.\nThe TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles\ndirectly into their path.  As the asteroid continues on its way, it\nleaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep\nspace.\n\nRattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in\nhysterics.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, this is suicide!\nHan notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful\nWookiee, pointing.\nHAN\nThere.  That looks pretty good.\nLEIA\nWhat looks pretty good?\nHAN\nYeah.  That'll do nicely.\nTHREEPIO\n(to Leia)\nExcuse me, ma'am, but where are\nwe going?\nOut the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of\nthe enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears.\n\nLEIA\nI hope you know what you're doing.\nHAN\nYeah, me too.\n\nHan and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems.\nThreepio and Leia watch worriedly.\nHAN\nI'm going to shut down everything\nbut the emergency power systems.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, I'm almost afraid to ask,\nbut... does that include shutting\nme down, too?\nChewie barks \"yes\".  But Han thinks otherwise.\nHAN\nNo, I need you to talk to the\nFalcon, find out what's wrong with\nthe hyperdrive.\nSuddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit\nto go flying.  Chewie howls.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, it's quite possible this\nasteroid is not entirely stable.\nHAN\nNot entirely stable?  I'm glad you're\nhere to tell us these things.  Chewie,\ntake the professor in the back and\nplug him into the hyperdrive.\nTHREEPIO\nOh!  Sometimes I just don't\nunderstand human behavior.  After\nall, I'm only trying to do my job\nin the most...\nThe sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he\nmove back to the hold.  Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia\nacross the cabin into Han's arms.  Then, abruptly, the motion stops as\nsuddenly as it started.  With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they\nare in each other's arms.\nLEIA\nLet go.\nHAN\nSshh!\nLEIA\nLet go, please.\nLeia flushes, averting her eyes.  She's not exactly fighting to get\nfree.  But, of course, Han blows it...\nHAN\nDon't get excited.\nThe anger rises in Leia.\nLEIA\nCaptain, being held by you isn't\nquite enough to get me excited.\nHAN\nSorry, sweetheart.  We haven't\ngot time for anything else.\nHan grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the\ndoor.  Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.\n\nThreepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in\nfront of him.  The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, where is Artoo when I need\nhim?\nHan enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, I don't know where your ship\nlearned to communicate, but it\nhas the most peculiar dialect.  I\nbelieve, sir, it says that the\npower coupling on the negative\naxis has been polarized.  I'm\nafraid you'll have to replace it.\nHAN\nWell, of course I'll have to replace\nit.\nHe hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.\nHAN\nHere!  And Chewie...\nChewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and\nwhines.  Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so\nonly he can hear.\nHAN\n(continuing)\n... I think we'd better replace\nthe negative power coupling.\nLeia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts\nto reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve.  It\ndoesn't budge.  Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her.  She\nrebuffs him.\nHAN\nHey, Your Worship, I'm only\ntrying to help.\nLEIA\n(still struggling)\nWould you please stop calling me\nthat?\nHan hears a new tone in her voice.  He watches her pull on the lever.\nHAN\nSure, Leia.\nLEIA\nOh, you make it so difficult\nsometimes.\nHAN\nI do, I really do.  You could be\na little nicer, though.\n(he watches her\nreaction)\nCome on, admit it.  Sometimes you\nthink I'm all right.\nShe lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.\nLEIA\nOccasionally...\n(a little smile,\nhaltingly)\n... when you aren't acting like\na scoundrel.\nHAN\n(laughs)\nScoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like\nthe sound of that.\nWith that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.\nLEIA\nStop that.\nHAN\nStop what?\nLeia is flushes, confused.\nLEIA\nStop that!  My hands are dirty.\nHAN\nMy hands are dirty, too.  What\nare you afraid of?\nLEIA\n(looking right\ninto his eyes)\nAfraid?\nHan looks at her with a piercing look.  He's never looked more\nhandsome, more dashing, more confident.  He reaches out slowly and\ntakes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console.  He\ndraws it toward him.\nHAN\nYou're trembling.\nLEIA\nI'm not trembling.\nThen with an irresistible combination of physical strength and\nemotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him...\nvery slowly.\nHAN\nYou like me because I'm a scoundrel.\nThere aren't enough scoundrels in\nyour life.\nLeia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an\nexcited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.\nLEIA\nI happen to like nice men.\nHAN\nI'm a nice man.\nLEIA\nNo, you're not.  You're...\nHe kisses her now, with slow, hot lips.  He takes his time, as though\nhe had forever, bending her body backward.  She has never been kissed\nlike this before, and it almost makes her faint.  When he stops, she\nregains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it\nhard to talk.\nSuddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, sir!  I've isolated the\nreverse power flux coupling.\nHan turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.\nHAN\nThank you.  Thank you very much.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.\nThe moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.\n\nThe Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of\nthe asteroid storm.\n\nThe ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window.  Threepio\nchecks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches\ntensely out the window.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, thank goodness we're coming\nout of the asteroid field.\nChewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside.  A\nbolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side\nof the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side.\n\nThe Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which\ncreates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship.  The\nFalcon tilts steeply, then rights itself.\n\nHan corrects the angle of his ship.\nHAN\nLet's get out of here.  Ready for\nlight-speed?  One... two... three!\nHan pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens.  Flak\nbursts continue to rock the ship.\nHAN\n(frantic)\nIt's not fair!\nChewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and\ncaptain.  Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.\nHAN\nThe transfer circuits are working.\nIt's not my fault!\nChewie puts his head in his hands, whining.\nLEIA\n(almost expecting\nit)\nNo light-speed?\nHAN\nIt's not my fault.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, we just lost the main rear\ndeflector shield.  One more direct\nhit on the back quarter and we're\ndone for.\nHan pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever.\nHAN\nTurn her around.\nChewie barks in puzzlement.\nHAN\nI said turn her around!  I'm\ngoing to put all power in the\nfront shield.\nLEIA\nYou're going to attack them?!\nTHREEPIO\nSir, the odds of surviving a\ndirect assault on an Imperial\nStar Destroyer...\nLEIA\nShut up!\n\nTHREEPIO\nCaptain Solo, this time you have\ngone too far.\n(Chewie growls)\nNo, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.\nWhy doesn't anyone listen to me?\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nThe fleet is beginning to break\nup.  Go back and stand by the\nmanual release for the landing claw.\nChewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.\nTHREEPIO\nI really don't see how that is\ngoing to help.  Surrender is a\nperfectly acceptable alternative\nin extreme circumstances.  The\nEmpire may be gracious enough...\nLeia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence.\nHAN\nThank you.\nLEIA\nWhat did you have in mind for\nyour next move?\nHAN\nWell, if they follow standard\nImperial procedure, they'll dump\ntheir garbage before they go to\nlight-speed, then we just float\naway.\nLEIA\nWith the rest of the garbage.\nThen what?\nHAN\nThen we've got to find a safe\nport somewhere around here.  Got\nany ideas?\nLEIA\nNo.  Where are we?\nHAN\nThe Anoat system.\nLEIA\nAnoat system.  There's not much\nthere.\nHAN\nNo.  Well, wait.  This is\ninteresting.  Lando.\nHe points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel.  Leia slips out\nof her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot.  Small light points\nrepresenting several systems flash by on the computer screen.\nLEIA\nLando system?\nHAN\nLando's not a system, he's a man.\nLando Calrissian.  He's a card\nplayer, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd\nlike him.\nLEIA\nThanks.\nHAN\nBespin.  It's pretty far, but I\nthink we can make it.\nLEIA\n(reading from the\ncomputer)\nA mining colony?\nHAN\nYeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando\nconned somebody out of it.  We\ngo back a long way, Lando and me.\nLEIA\nCan you trust him?\nHAN\nNo.  But he has no love for the\nEmpire, I can tell you that.\nChewie barks over the intercom.  Han quickly changes his readouts and\nstretches to look out the cockpit window.\nHAN\n(into intercom)\nHere we go, Chewie.  Stand by.\nDetach!\nHan leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile.  She\nthinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and\nshe gives him a quick kiss.\nLEIA\nYou do have your moments.  Not\nmany, but you have them.\n\nOne of the cloud cars opens fire on the Falcon, its flak rocking the\nship.  Chewie barks his concern.\nHAN\n(into transmitter)\nNo, I don't have a landing\npermit.  I'm trying to reach\nLando Calrissian.\nMore flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ship's\ninterior.  Leia looks worried.\nHAN\n(into transmitter)\nWhoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me\nexplain.\nINTERCOM VOICE\nYou will not deviate from your\npresent course.\nTHREEPIO\nRather touchy, aren't they?\nLEIA\nI thought you knew this person.\nChewie barks and growls at his boss.\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nWell, that was a long time ago.\nI'm sure he's forgotten about\nthat.\nINTERCOM VOICE\nPermission granted to land on\nPlatform Three-two-seven.\nHAN\n(into transmitter)\nThank you.\nAngry, Han snaps off the intercom.  Chewie looks at him and grunts.\nHan turns to the worried princess and her droid.\nHAN\nThere's nothing to worry about.\nWe go way back, Lando and me.\nLeia doesn't look convinced.\nLEIA\nWho's worried?\n\nArtoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the\nFalcon.\nTHREEPIO\nI thought that hairy beast would\nbe the end of me.  Of course, I've\nlooked better.\nArtoo beeps understandingly.\n\nChewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches\nover their shoulders.  As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship\nbegins to move.\n\nLeia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled.  Chewie is\nbusy operating the ship.  Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a\nreadout on the control panel.\nLEIA\nLuke... We've got to go back.\nChewie growls in surprise.\nLANDO\nWhat?\nLEIA\nI know where Luke is.\nLANDO\nBut what about those fighter?\nChewie barks in agreement with Lando.\nLEIA\nChewie, just do it.\nLANDO\nBut what about Vader?\nChewie turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.\nLANDO\nAll right, all right, all right.\n\nThe Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city.  Three TIE\nfighter close in on the starship.\n\nLeia tries to remain calm.\nLANDO\n(pointing out the\ncockpit window)\nLook, someone's up there.\nLEIA\nIt's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.\nSlow down and we'll get under him.\nLando, open the top hatch.\nLando rushes out of the cockpit.\n\nOut the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the\ncity.  The ship gains on him.\nLEIA\nOkay.  Easy, Chewie.\nThe Falcon closes in on Luke.\n\nThe hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure.  Lando reaches out to help\nthe battered warrior inside the ship.\n\nFlak bursts all around it as the Falcon banks away from the city.  Leia\nand Chewie struggle with the controls.\nLEIA\n(into intercom)\nLando?\nLANDO\n(over intercom)\nOkay, let's go.\n\nExplosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly.\nChewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship.\nLeia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered, enter the\ncockpit supported by Lando.  Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie\nbarks in joyous relief.\nLUKE\nOh, Leia.\nLANDO\nAll right, Chewie.  Let's go.\nLeia helps Luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship.\n\nLuke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff.\nLeia gently wipes his face.  The ship lurches again.\nLEIA\nI'll be back.\nShe kisses him, then leaves the quarters.\n\nAll over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound.  Lando anxiously watches\nthe flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some\nswitches.  Seated next to him, Chewie points out a new blip appearing\non the panel.  Leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the\nshape.\nLEIA\nStar Destroyer.\nLANDO\nAll right, Chewie.  Ready for\nlight-speed.\nLEIA\nIf your people fixed the\nhyperdrive.\nAnother explosion rocks the ship.  Leia notices as a green light on the\npanel next to her flashes on.\nLEIA\nAll the coordinates are set.\nIt's now or never.\nChewie barks in agreement.\nLANDO\nPunch it!\nThe Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle.  The\nsound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up.  Faces are tense,\nexpectant.  But nothing happens, and the engine goes off.  Chewie lets\nout a frustrated howl.  The flak still violently rocks the ship.\nLANDO\nThey told me they fixed it.  I\ntrusted them to fix it.  It's not\nmy fault!\nChewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit.  He gives\nLando and angry shove as he storms past him.\n\nBeeping while he works, Artoo is busy connecting some wires to Threepio\nwho now has one leg attached.\nChewie enters through the doorway, grunting to himself.\nTHREEPIO\nNoisy brute.  Why don't we just\ngo into light-speed?\nArtoo beeps in response.\nTHREEPIO\nWe can't?  How would you know the\nhyperdrive is deactivated?\nArtoo whistles knowingly.\nTHREEPIO\nThe city's central computer told\nyou?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better\nthan to trust a strange computer.\nOuch!  Pay attention to what\nyou're doing!\nChewie is in the pit.  He is trying to loosen something with an\nenormous wrench.  Frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club and hits\nthe panel...\n\nLeia and Lando, seated in front of the control panel, are suddenly\nsprayed by a shower of sparks.\n\nLuke realizes that Vader's ship is very near.  He feels resigned to his\nfate.  He senses that he is beaten, more emotionally than physically.\nLUKE\nFather.\n\nLUKE\n(moaning)\nBen, why didn't you tell me?\n\nLando and Leia are at the controls of the Falcon.  Meanwhile, in the\nship's hold, Chewie continues to work frantically on the hyperdrive\nmechanism.\nLANDO\n(into intercom)\nChewie!\n\nLuke enters the cockpit and looks out the window.  He is almost\nunconscious with pain and depression.\nLUKE\nIt's Vader.\n\nLUKE\nBen, why didn't you tell me?\n\nArtoo races to a control panel and starts working on a circuit board.\nFurious, Threepio stands on one leg, yelling.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, come back at once!  You\nhaven't finished with me yet!\nYou don't know how to fix the\nhyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do\nit.  I'm standing here in pieces,\nand you're having delusions of\ngrandeur!\nArtoo moves a circuit on a control panel.  Suddenly, the control panel\nlights up.\n\nLeia and Lando are thrown into their seats as the Millennium Falcon\nunexpectedly shoot into hyperspace.\n\nThe ship tilts up and Artoo topples into the pit on top of Chewie.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, you did it!\n\nLando sits in the pilot's seat as he talks into the comlink.  Chewie\nbusily throws a variety of switches in preparation for takeoff.\nLANDO\n(into comlink)\nLuke, we're ready for takeoff.\nLUKE\n(over comlink)\nGood luck, Lando\nLANDO\n(into comlink)\nWhen we find Jabba the Hut and\nthat bounty hunter, we'll contact\nyou.\n\nLANDO\n(into comlink)\nPrincess, we'll find Han.  I\npromise.\n\nLando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some\ngetting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando\nspeaks into his comlink.\nLANDO\nAdmiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.\nACKBAR \t(VO)\nProceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.\nLando turns to his weird copilot.\nLANDO\nDon't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down\non time...\n(to himself)\nor this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.\nThe copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.\nACKBAR\t (VO)\nAll craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.\nLANDO\nAll right. Stand by.\nHe pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.\n\nLando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio.\nLANDO\nAll wings report in.\nWEDGE\nRed Leader standing by.\nGRAY LEADER\nGray Leader standing by.\nGREEN LEADER\nGreen Leader standing by.\nWEDGE\nLock S-foils in attack positions.\n\nLando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to\nthe control panel and talks to Lando.\nLANDO\nWe've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up\nor down. Well, how\ncould they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.\nLando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star as the\nimplications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch on his\ncomlink.\nLANDO\nBreak off the attack! The shield is still up.\nRED LEADER\t (VO)\nI get no reading. Are you sure?\nLANDO\nPull up! All craft pull up!\nThe Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and the\nDeath Star move off right.\n\nLando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel\nsquads.\nLANDO\nWatch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!\nWEDGE\nRed Three, Red Two, pull in!\nRED TWO\nGot it!\nRED THREE\nThree of them coming in, twenty degrees!\nWEDGE\nCut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical\nfrigate.\nLando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at\nthe TIEs from the belly guns.\nNAVIGATOR\nPressure's steady.\nThe copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.\nLANDO\nOnly the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers\nare waiting for.\n\nThe ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel cruiser.\nLando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the Death Star\nfirepower.\nLANDO\nThat blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!\n(into comlink)\nHome One, this is Gold Leader.\n\nLando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating\ngiants. He's been yelling into the comlink.\nLANDO\t (desperately)\nYes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star\nDestroyers at point-\nblank range.\nACKBAR\nAt that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.\nLANDO\nWe'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might\njust take a few of\nthem with us.\nThe Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and\nbegin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the\ngiant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.\nThe control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.\nREBEL PILOT\nShe's gonna blow!\nY-WING PILOT\nI'm hit!\nThe damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into\nthe control tower, exploding.\n\nLando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the dashing\nBaron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor\nshaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of the Falcon.\nWEDGE\nThere it is!\nLANDO\nAll right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.\nWEDGE\nCopy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.\nThe X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several\nproton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small\nexplosions.\nThe Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously\nclose, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon with a\npowerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor.\nHe maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of\nthe continuing chain of explosions.\n\nLando and Nien Nunb laugh and cheer in relief.",
  "Detention Area": "Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches\nthe trio.\nOFFICER\nWhere are you taking this... thing?\nChewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut\nup.\nLUKE\nPrisoner transfer from Block one-one-\nthree-eight.\nOFFICER\nI wasn't notified. I'll have to clear\nit.\nThe officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in\nthe information. There are only three other troopers in the\narea. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the\nalarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of\nChewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.\nSuddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one\nof his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.\nHAN\nLook out! He's loose!\nLUKE\nHe's going to pull us all apart.\nHAN\nGo get him!\nThe startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and\nHan have already pulled out their laser pistols and are\nblasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of\nlaserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser\ngate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the\nlast of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is\nabout to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink\nsystem, which is screeching questions about what is going\non.  He quickly checks the computer readout.\nHAN\nWe've got to find out which cell\nthis princess of yours is in. Here\nit is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.\nYou go get her. I'll hold them here.\nLuke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into\nthe buzzing comlink.\nHAN\n(sounding official)\nEverything is under control. Situation\nnormal.\nINTERCOM VOICE\nWhat happened?\nHAN\n(getting nervous)\nUh... had a slight weapons\nmalfunction. But, uh, everything's\nperfectly all right now. We're fine.\nWe're all fine here, now, thank you.\nHow are you?\nINTERCOM VOICE\nWe're sending a squad up.\nHAN\nUh, uh, negative. We had a reactor\nleak here now. Give us a few minutes\nto lock it down. Large leak... very\ndangerous.\nINTERCOM VOICE\nWho is this? What's your operating\nnumber?\nHan blasts the comlink and it explodes.\nHAN\nBoring conversation anyway.\n(yelling down the\nhall)\nLuke! We're going to have company!",
  "Massassi Outpost": "The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.\n\nAn alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.\nHe sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely\nvisible in the foliage.\n\nRotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple\nlies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the\nfantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the\nothers are greeted by the Rebel troops.\nLuke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored\nmilitary speeder.\n\nA lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape,\nsurveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of\ntwisted green.\n\nLuke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship\nhangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.\nFlight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and\nunlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this\nactivity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes\nonto an armored speeder.\nMAN'S VOICE\n(over loudspeaker)\nAll flight trooper, man your stations.\nAll flight troops, man your stations.\nHan is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter\npilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of\nhis friend's departure.\nLUKE\nSo... you got your reward and you're\njust leaving then?\nHAN\nThat's right, yeah! I got some old\ndebts I've got to pay off with this\nstuff. Even if I didn't, you don't\nthink I'd be fool enough to stick\naround here, do you? Why don't you\ncome with us? You're pretty good in\na fight. I could use you.\nLUKE\n(getting angry)\nCome on! Why don't you take a look\naround? You know what's about to\nhappen, what they're up against.\nThey could use a good pilot like\nyou. You're turning your back on\nthem.\nHAN\nWhat good's a reward if you ain't\naround to use it? Besides, attacking\nthat battle station ain't my idea of\ncourage. It's more like suicide.\nLUKE\nAll right. Well, take care of\nyourself, Han. I guess that's what\nyou're best at, isn't it?\nLuke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.\nHAN\nHey, Luke... may the Force be with\nyou!\nLuke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in\na small wave and then goes off.\nHan turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,\nHAN\nWhat're you lookin' at? I know what\nI'm doing.\n\nAll that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing\non a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The\nmuted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this\neerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion\nrockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage\nin a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud\ncover.\n\nThe princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly\nbefore the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its\nfour moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves\never closer to the system. A series of green dots appear\naround the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills\nthe war room.\nMASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE\nStand-by alert. Death Star\napproaching. Estimated time to firing\nrange, fifteen minutes.\n\nPrincess Leia listens to the battle over the intercom.\nThreepio is at her side.\nWEDGE\n(over war room speaker\nsystem)\nHeavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees.\nRED LEADER\n(over speaker)\nI see it. Stay low.\n\nPrincess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces\nnervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides\ntechnicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna\nwatches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working\nover a screen speaks into his headset.\nCONTROL OFFICER\nSquad leaders, we've picked up a new\ngroup of signals. Enemy fighters\ncoming your way.\n\nA concerned Princess Leia, Threepio, Dodonna, and other\nofficers of the Rebellion stand around the huge round readout\nscreen, listening to the ship-to-ship communication on the\nroom's loudspeaker.\nBIGGS\n(over speaker)\nPull in! Luke... pull in!\nWEDGE\n(over speaker)\nWatch your back, Luke!\n\nIn the war room, Leia stands frozen as she listens and worries\nabout Luke.\nRED LEADER\n(over speaker)\nCan you see Red Five?\nRED TEN\n(over speaker)\nThere's a heavy fire zone on this\nside. Red Five, where are you?\n\nLeia, Threepio, Dodonna and other Rebel officers are listening\nto the Rebel Fighter's radio transmissions over the war room\nintercom.\nBIGGS\n(over speaker)\nGood shooting, Wedge!\nGOLD LEADER\n(over speaker)\nRed Leader...\n\nLeia and the others are grouped around the screen, as\ntechnicians move about attending to their duties.\nRED LEADER\n(over speaker)\nI copy, Gold Leader. Move into\nposition.\n\nTechnicians are seated at the computer readout table.\nGOLD LEADER\n(over speaker)\nThe exhaust post is...\n\nGOLD FIVE\n(over speaker)\nI'd say about twenty guns. Some on\nthe surface, some on the towers.\nLeia, Threepio, and the technicians view the projected target\nscreen, as red and blue target lights glow. The red target\nnear the center blinks on and off.\nMASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE\n(over speaker)\nDeath Star will be in range in five\nminutes.\n\nDodonna moves to the intercom as he fiddles with the computer\nkeys.\nRED LEADER\n(over speaker)\nRendezvous at mark six point one.\nWEDGE\n(over speaker)\nThis is Red Two.

The room is grim\nafter Red Leader's death. Princess Leia nervously paces the\nroom.\nLUKE\n(over speaker)\nBiggs, Wedge, let's close it up.\nWe're going in. We're going in full\nthrottle.\n\nLeia and the others are grouped around the computer board.\nWEDGE\n(over speaker)\nI'm hit! I can't stay with you.\nLUKE\n(over speaker)\nGet clear, Wedge.\n\nLeia and the others stare at the computer board.\n\nPrincess Leia returns her general's worried and doubtful\nglances with solid, grim determination. Threepio seems\nnervous.\nTHREEPIO\nHang on, Artoo!\n\nLeia and the others stand watching the projected screen.\nBASE VOICE\n(over speaker)\nHis computer's off. Luke, you switched\noff your targeting computer. What's\nwrong?\nLUKE\n(over speaker)\nNothing.

He waddles up to the group and stands next to\nan equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the\nwhole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other\ndignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is\ndressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.\nShe rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He\nwinks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who\nis moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled\ntroops, who all bow before them.

  "Massassi": "The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set\nup in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the\ncommander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and\ngives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.\nWILLARD\n(holding Leia)\nYou're safe! We had feared the worst.\nWillard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.\nWILLARD\nWhen we heard about Alderaan, we\nwere afraid that you were... lost\nalong with your father.\nLEIA\nWe don't have time for our sorrows,\nCommander. The battle station has\nsurely tracked us here.\n(looking pointedly to\nHan)\nIt's the only explanation for the\nease of our escape. You must use the\ninformation in this R2 unit to plan\nthe attack. It is our only hope.\n\nDodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia\nand several other senators are to one side of the giant\nreadout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots,\nnavigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is\nlistening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and\nChewbacca are standing near the back.\nDODONNA\nThe battle station is heavily shielded\nand carries a firepower greater than\nhalf the star fleet. It's defenses\nare designed around a direct large-\nscale assault. A small one-man fighter\nshould be able to penetrate the outer\ndefense.\nGold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands\nand addresses Dodonna.\nGOLD LEADER\nPardon me for asking, sir, but what\ngood are snub fighters going to be\nagainst that?\nDODONNA\nWell, the Empire doesn't consider a\nsmall one-man fighter to be any\nthreat, or they'd have a tighter\ndefense. An analysis of the plans\nprovided by Princess Leia has\ndemonstrated a weakness in the battle\nstation.\nArtoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping\nsounds, and turns his head from right to left.\nDODONNA\nThe approach will not be easy. You\nare required to maneuver straight\ndown this trench and skim the surface\nto this point. The target area is\nonly two meters wide. It's a small\nthermal exhaust port, right below\nthe main port. The shaft leads\ndirectly to the reactor system. A\nprecise hit will start a chain\nreaction which should destroy the\nstation.\nA murmer of disbelief runs through the room.\nDODONNA\nOnly a precise hit will set up a\nchain reaction. The shaft is ray-\nshielded, so you'll have to use proton\ntorpedoes.\nLuke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about\nsixteen years old.\nWEDGE\nThat's impossible, even for a\ncomputer.\nLUKE\nIt's not impossible. I used to bull's-\neye womp rats in my T-sixteen back\nhome. They're not much bigger than\ntwo meters.\nDODONNA\nMan your ships! And may the Force be\nwith you!\nThe group rises and begins to leave.",

No\none can choose it for him.\nLUKE\nI only wish Ben were here.\nLeia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off.

Do you want a new one?\nLUKE\nNot on your life! That little droid\nand I have been through a lot\ntogether.\n(to Artoo)\nYou okay, Artoo?\nThe crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of\nthe exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps\nthat he is fine.\nLuke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an\nhis helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive\nhangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner\ninto Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo\nbeeps good-bye.\nCHIEF\nOkay, easy she goes!\nTHREEPIO\nHang on tight,Artoo, you've got to\ncome back.\nArtoo beeps in agreement.\nTHREEPIO\nYou wouldn't want my life to get\nboring, would you?\nArtoo whistles his reply.\nAll final preparations are made for the approaching battle.\nThe hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the\npilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The\nhum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted\nvoice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses\nare disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit\nshields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman,\nholding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace\nof a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.\nBEN'S VOICE\nLuke, the Force will be with you.\nLuke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.\n\nHan, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping switches as\nChewie watches a troublesome gauge.  A worried Leia observes their\nefforts.\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nHow's this?\nThe Wookiee barks a negative reply.\nLEIA\nWould it helped if I got out and\npushed?\nHAN\nIt might.\nThreepio clanks into the hold.\nTHREEPIO\nCaptain Solo, Captain Solo... sir,\nmight I suggest that you...\nHan gives the gold robot a devastating look.\nTHREEPIO\nIt can wait.\n\nThey move to the cockpit where Han flips some more switches.  Leia\nwatches him, impatient, disbelieving.\nLEIA\nThis bucket of bolts is never going\nto get us past that blockade.\nHAN\nThis baby's got a few surprises\nleft in her, sweetheart.\nHan and Leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of\nstormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar.\nQuickly, Han straps himself into the pilot's seat and Leia into the\nnavigator's chair.\n\nA laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim at the\nImperial troops.\nThe stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by\nthe Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions.\n\nChewie rushes into the cockpit.\nHAN\nCome on!  Come on!  Switch over.\nLet's hope we don't have a burnout.\nA laser hits the window near Chewie as he is settling into his chair.\nLetting out a loud whelp, Chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and\nthe first stage of engine fire can be heard.  Han flashes a big grin at\nLeia.\nHAN\nSee?\nLEIA\nSomeday you're going to be wrong,\nand I hope I'm there to see it.\nHan looks at Chewie.\nHAN\nPunch it!\nThe roar of the Falcon's main engines blasts out everything as the ice-\ncave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window.",

  "Hoth": "A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A\nstrange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the\nsmoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the\nsnow plain and disappears into the distance.\n\nA stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous\nice cave.\n\nRebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing\ntheir new base.  The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls\noff his goggles.\nHe walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which\nis parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various\nother droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his\nWookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter.  Chewie\nstops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated\ngreeting to his boss.\nHAN\nChewie!\nThe Wookiee grumbles a reply.\nHAN\nAll right, don't lose your temper.\nI'll come right back and give you\na hand.\nChewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han\nleaves.\n\nA makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick\nice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers,\ntroops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and\nmonitoring radar signals.\nGeneral Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach.\nRIEEKAN\nSolo?\nHAN\nNo sign of life out there, General.\nThe sensors are in place.  You'll\nknow if anything comes around.\nRIEEKAN\nCommander Skywalker reported in yet?\nHAN\nNo.  He's checking out a meteorite\nthat hit near him.\nRIEEKAN\n(indicates radar\nscreen)\nWith all the meteor activity in this\nsystem, it's going to be difficult\nto spot approaching ships.\nTaking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.\nHAN\nGeneral, I've got to leave.  I\ncan't stay anymore.\nPrincess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short\nwhite combat jacket and pants.  Her hair is braided across her head in\na Nordic fashion.  She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat\ndistressed.\nRIEEKAN\nI'm sorry to hear that.\nHAN\nWell, there's a price on my head.\nIf I don't pay off Jabba the Hut,\nI'm a dead man.\nRIEEKAN\nA death mark's not an easy thing\nto live with.  You're a good\nfighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you.\nHAN\nThank you, General.\nHe turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.\nHAN\n(with feeling)\nWell, Your Highness, I guess this\nis it.\nLEIA\nThat's right.\nLeia is angry.  Han sees she has no warmth to offer him.  He shakes his\nhead and adopts a sarcastic tone.\nHAN\n(cooly)\nWell, don't get all mushy on me.\nSo long, Princess.\nHan walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center.\nLeia stews a moment, then hurries after him.\n\nLEIA\nHan!\nHan stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.\nHAN\nYes, Your Highnessness?\nLEIA\nI thought you decided to stay.\nHAN\nWell, the bounty hunter we ran\ninto on Ord Mantell changed my\nmind.\nLEIA\nHan, we need you!\nHAN\nWe?\nLEIA\nYes.\nHAN\nOh, what about you need?\nLEIA\n(mystified)\nI need?  I don't know what you're\ntalking about.\nHAN\n(shakes his head,\nfed up)\nYou probably don't.\nLEIA\nAnd what precisely am I supposed\nto know?\nHAN\nCome on!  You want me to stay\nbecause of the way you feel about\nme.\nLEIA\nYes.  You're a great help to us.\nYou're a natural leader...\nHAN\nNo!  That's not it.  Come on.\nAahhh - uh huh!  Come on.\nLeia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.\nLEIA\nYou're imagining things.\nHAN\nAm I?  Then why are you following\nme?  Afraid I was going to leave\nwithout giving you a goodbye kiss?\nLEIA\nI'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.\nHAN\nI can arrange that.  You could use\na good kiss!\nAngrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.\n\nA familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo-\nDetoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an\nice wall toward the main hangar.\nTHREEPIO\nDon't try to blame me.  I didn't\nask you to turn on the thermal\nheater.  I merely commented that it\nwas freezing in the princess'\nchamber.  But it's supposed to be\nfreezing.  How are we going to dry\nout all her clothes?  I really don't\nknow.\nArtoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, switch off.\n\nThe two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter.  Han and Chewie are\nstruggling with their central lifters.\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nWhy do you take this apart now?\nI'm trying to get us out of here\nand you pull both of these.\nChewie grumbles in irritation.\nTHREEPIO\nExcuse me, sir.\nHAN\n(to Chewie)\nPut them back together right now.\nTHREEPIO\nMight I have a word with you,\nplease?\nHAN\nWhat do you want?\nTHREEPIO\nWell, it's Princess Leia, sir.\nShe's been trying to get you on\nthe communicator.\nHAN\nI turned it off.  I don't want to\ntalk to her.\nTHREEPIO\nOh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering\nabout Master Luke.  He hasn't come\nback yet.  She doesn't know where he\nis.\nHAN\nI don't know where he is.\nTHREEPIO\nNobody knows where he is.\nHAN\nWhat do you mean, \"nobody knows\"?\nHan glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as\nnight slowly begins to fall on the planet.\nTHREEPIO\nWell, uh, you see...\nHan jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.\nHAN\nDeck Officer.  Deck Officer!\nTHREEPIO\nExcuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...\nHan abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer\napproaches.\nDECK OFFICER\nYes, sir?\nHAN\nDo you know where Commander\nSkywalker is?\nDECK OFFICER\nI haven't seen him.  It's possible\nhe came in through the south entrance.\nHAN\nIt's possible?  Why don't you go\nfind out?  It's getting dark out there.\nDECK OFFICER\nYes, sir.\nThe deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's\nmouth.\nTHREEPIO\nExcuse me, sir.  Might I inquire\nwhat's going on?\nHAN\nWhy not?\nTHREEPIO\nImpossible man.  Come along, Artoo,\nlet's find Princess Leia.  Between\nourselves, I think Master Luke is\nin considerable danger.\n\nThe deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the\ntunnel.\nDECK OFFICER\nSir, Commander Skywalker hasn't\ncome in through the south entrance.\nHe might have forgotten to check in.\nHAN\nNot likely.  Are the speeders ready?\nDECK OFFICER\nNot yet.  We're having some trouble\nadapting them to the cold.\nHAN\nThen we'll have to go out on\nTauntauns.\nDECK OFFICER\nSir, the temperature's dropping too\nrapidly.\nHAN\nThat's right.  And my friends out\nin it.\nASSISTANT OFFICER\nI'll cover sector twelve.  Have\ncom-control set screen alpha.\nHan pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.\nDECK OFFICER\nYour Tauntaun'll freeze before you\nreach the first marker.\nHAN\nThen I'll see you in hell!\nHan maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter\nnight.\n\nThe jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of\na Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy\nstalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One\nside of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens\nhis eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the\ngorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and\nfutilely tries to unfasten the throngs.\nExhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there,\nhe spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about\nthree feet out of reach.\nHe focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he\nsqueezes his eyes tight in concentration.\nJust as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into\nLuke's hand.\nThe young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts\nhimself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The\nstartled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke\nscrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams\nin pain.\n\nLuke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight.  Weak\nand exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.\n\nA small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile\nvastness of snow and cold.  As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up\nlarge clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.\n\nArtoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.  Threepio moves\nstiffly over to him.\nTHREEPIO\nYou must come along now, Artoo.\nThere's really nothing more we can\ndo.  And my joints are freezing up.\nArtoo beeps, long and low.\nTHREEPIO\nDon't say thing like that!  Of\ncourse we'll see Master Luke again.\nHe'll be quite all right, you'll see.\n(to himself)\nStupid little short-circuit.  He'll\nbe quite all right.\nThreepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully\nkeeps his vigil.\n\nThe wind is blowing quite strong now.  Luke struggles to stay upright,\nbut a blast of freezing snow knocks him over.  He struggles to get up,\nbut he can't.  The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple\nof feet and then collapses.\n\nLuke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.  Slowly he looks\nup and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.  It is\nhard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.\nBEN\nLuke... Luke.\nLUKE\n(weakly)\nBen?\nBEN\nYou will go to the Dagobah system.\nLUKE\nDagobah system?\nBEN\nThere you will learn from Yoda,\nthe Jedi Master who instructed me.\nThe image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching\nfrom the windswept horizon.\nLUKE\n(groaning faintly)\nBen... Ben.\nLuke drops into unconsciousness.\nHan pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered\nfriend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low,\npitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him\nurgently.\nHAN\nLuke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.\nCome on, give me a sign here.\nLuke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping\nLuke's unconscious face.  As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a\nrasping sound behind him.  He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun\nstagger and then fall over into the snow.\nHan carries Luke to the moaning beast.  Then, with a final groan, the\nTauntaun expires.\nHAN\nNot much time.\nHe pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.\nLUKE\n(moaning)\nBen... Ben...\nHAN\nHang on, kid.\nLUKE\nDagobah system...\nHan ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe.  He\nquickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's\ninert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.\nHAN\n(reeling from the\nodor)\nWhew...\nLUKE\nDagobah...\nHAN\nThis may smell bad, kid...\nLUKE\n(moaning)\nYoda...\nHAN\n...but it will keep you warm...\ntil I get the shelter built.\n(struggling to get\nLuke inside the\ncarcass)\nOoh... I thought they smelled bad\non the outside!\nThe wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.  Han\nremoves a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter\ncontainer.  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection\nagainst a bitter Hoth night.\n\nFour snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.\n\nThe small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new\ndirection.\n\nThe small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side.\nA makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift.  Han spots\nZev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his\narms frantically at the tiny craft.\n\nRieekan looks up grimly from a console screen.  He calls over to Leia\nand Han.\nRIEEKAN\nPrincess... we have a visitor.\nThe group hurries over to Rieekan.\nRIEEKAN\nWe've picked up something outside\nthe base in zone twelve, moving\neast.\nSENIOR CONTROLLER\nIt's metal.\nLEIA\nThen it couldn't be one of those\ncreatures that attacked Luke.\nHAN\nIt could be a speeder, one of ours.\nSENIOR CONTROLLER\nNo.  Wait - there's something very\nweak coming through.\nThreepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the\nstrange signal.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, I am fluent in six million\nforms of communication.  This signal\nis not used by the Alliance.  It\ncould be an Imperial code.\nThe transmission ends in static.\nHAN\nIt isn't friendly, whatever it is.\nCome on, Chewie, let's check it out.\nRIEEKAN\nSend Rogues Ten and Eleven to\nstation three-eight.\n\nThe dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three-\neight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base.  It raises a large\nantenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing\nsignal.\nThe probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has\npopped his head over a snow bank.  Instantly, the probe robot swings\naround, its deadly ray ready to fire.  But before it can get a shot\noff, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million\npieces.\nHan Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the\nsmoldering remains of the Imperial probe.\n\nLeia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink.\nHAN\n(over comlink)\nAfraid there's not much left.\nLEIA\n(into comlink)\nWhat was it?\nHAN\n(over comlink)\nDroid of some kind.  I didn't hit\nit that hard.  It must have had a\nself-destruct.\nLEIA\n(into comlink)\nAn Imperial probe droid.\nHAN\n(over comlink)\nIt's a good bet the Empire knows\nwe're here.\nRIEEKAN\nWe'd better start the evacuation.\n\nA captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the\nmain transport bay.  Several Rebel transports behind them are being\nloaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly, but not in\npanic.\nREBEL CAPTAIN\nGroups seven and ten will stay\nbehind to fly the speeders.  As\nsoon as each transport is loaded,\nevacuation control will give\nclearance for immediate launch.\nREBEL FIGHTER\nRight, sir.\n\nAlarms sound.  Troops, ground crews, and droids rush to their alert\nstations.  Armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near\nthe main entrance.\nIn the midst of all this activity, Han does some frantic welding on the\nlifters of the Millennium Falcon.\nHan finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor.  He pulls out\nhis comlink, all the while eyeing problematic lifters.\nHAN\n(into comlink, to\nChewie)\nOkay, that's it.  Try it... Off!\nTurn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!\nSmoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter.  Exasperated, Han\nsurveys the new damage.\n\nRebel troops carry heavy bazooka-type weapons and position them along\nthe snow trench.  Men hurriedly respond to their officers' yelled\norders and brace themselves against the rhythmic gusts of bitter-cold\nwind.\nOther troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing its guns into\nposition.\n\nNear the base power generators, troops rush to set up their heavy\nbattle equipment.  Buzzing loudly, the generators send along, sparking\nfingers of energy into the bitter Hoth wind.\n\nA thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape.  Small dot-size\nobjects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the\nRebel base.\n\nA Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes.  Through\nthe lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker.  He\nadjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the\nominous battle machines.  Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the\nguns of the lumbering snow walkers.\nThe officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding\nbegins to make the ground vibrate.  The pounding grows louder and is\naccompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling.  The officer speaks\ninto his comlink.\nTRENCH OFFICER\nEcho Station Three-T-Eight.\n\nThe Rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as explosions erupt\nall around them.  They are nervous and their grip on their weapons\ntightens from the cold and from fear.\nBehind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the sky.\n\nThe fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full throttle.\nThey accelerate away from the base and head toward the distant walkers.\n\nThe cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the speeders.  Other\nwalkers loom in the background.  Two speeders race away past two of the\nenormous walkers and bank to the right.\n\nTwo speeders race directly at the head of a walker, then split and fly\npast it.\nThree other walkers march onward, firing all cannons.\n\nRebel troops fire on the approaching walkers, as the snow and ice\nexplode all around them.\n\nA speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker.  Two other\nspeeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction.  Other\nRebel craft race just above the icy plain.\nA giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and\nsending it crashing in a ball of flames.\n\nRogue Leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation toward the\nwalker as explosions burst all around them.\n\nRebel troops fire the dishlike ray gun while explosions erupt around\nthem.\n\nTwo walkers lumber toward the Rebel base as a speeder between them\nexplodes in a ball of flames.\n\nThe dislike ray gun is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes.\n\nWedge's speeder races through the legs of one of the monstrous walkers.\n\nThe harpoon hurtles toward the walker, In an instant it is embedded in\none of the walker's legs.\n\nThe speeder Rogue Three races around one of the giant walker's feet,\ntrailing the cable behind it.  Continuing around the back foot, Rogue\nThree then circles the walker around the tail end.\n\nThe speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant legs, towing the\ncable behind it.\n\nThe speeder zooms away into the distance.  The tangled legs of the\nenormous war machine attempt a step, but as they do the giant Imperial\nwalker begins to topple.  It teeters for a moment, and then crashes\nonto the icy ground, sending snow and metal pieces flying.\n\nThe troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the crashing walker.\nAn officer gives a signal to his men and Rebel troops charge the fallen\nwar machine.\nTRENCH OFFICER\nCome on!\nThe troops run toward the downed walker, followed by two Rebel speeders\nflying overhead.  Just as they reach the walker, it explodes, the\nimpact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground.\n\nThe fierce battle on the vast snow plains of Hoth rages on.  The\nImperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on the Rebel base,\nfiring lasers as they lumber ever onward.  In the snow trench, Rebel\ntroops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions\nerupt around them.  A gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly\nexplodes.  Another blast destroys a ray gun.\n\nLuke's speeder and Rogue Two fly in formation, banking from right to\nleft and flying above the erupting battlefield.  Flak bursts all around\nthem.\n\nThe two speeders race across the horizon toward the giant walkers.\n\nThree of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward the Rebel\nheadquarters.\n\nContinuing their retreat, the Rebels see the walkers looming ever\nnearer.\n\nOn the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over\nhim.  He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing\noverhead.\nRunning beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at\nthe walker's underside.  A thin cable follows the projectile from the\ngun.  The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.\nStill running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his\nbelt buckle.  Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling\nunderneath the walker.\nThe walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen\nsnow.  Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to\nthe walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.  Hanging precariously, Luke\ncuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.\nHe takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the\nImperial machine.  Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto\nthe icy ground far below.  He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg\npasses by - and just misses him.\nThe giant walker stops in mid-step.  A muffled explosion comes from\nwithin - and then the walker's mechanical insides  are spewed out every\nconceivable opening.  The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like\na locomotive on stilts.\n\nVeers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base.  The\nsmoldering walker that Luke exploded stands smoking just to the right\nof Veers's path.\n\nThe Rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed back by the\nrelentless Imperial assault.\n\nWith Threepio lagging behind, Han and Leia race through the crumbling\nice corridors.  Suddenly, there is an explosion.  Han turns, grabs the\nprincess, and pulls her to the wall as a tremendous cave-in blacks\ntheir path.\nHe takes the comlink from his pocket.\nHAN\n(into comlink)\nTransport, this is Solo.  Better\ntake off - I can't get to you.\nI'll get the princess out on the\nFalcon.\nHan and Leia turn and race down the corridor.\nTHREEPIO\nBut... but... but... where are\nyou going?  Uh... come back!!\n\nImperial troops have reached the base.  As they push through the\nblocked passageway, Darth Vader strides behind them.\n\nHan and Leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar where the\nMillennium Falcon is docked.  Threepio still lags behind.\nTHREEPIO\nWait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!\nThe door to the hangar closes in his face.\nTHREEPIO\n(exasperated)\nHow typical.\nQuickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the golden droid\nthrough.\nHAN\nCome on.\n\nChewie paces under the shelter of the Millennium Falcon's landing gear.\nThe giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a\nfew reassuring words.  As he searches worriedly for his captain,\nsomething at last catches his eye.\nChewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia running toward\nthe ship.  The Wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl,\nthen runs up the ship's ramp.  Han and Leia run up the ramp after him,\nclosely followed by Threepio.\nHAN\nHurry up, goldenrod, or you're\ngoing to be a permanent resident!\nTHREEPIO\nWait!  Wait!\n\nImperial troops run through the base corridors.  Vader surveys the\nplace.  A huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but  he calmly,\npurposefully, continues around it.\n\nStormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon.  Behind them\nthe giant hangar doors open slowly.\n\nLuke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon races above\nthem, flying very close to the ground.\nThe three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their X-wing\nfighters, each going to his own ship.  Luke waves farewell, then heads\ntoward his own fighter.\nArtoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as Luke\nclimbs aboard the spacecraft.\nLUKE\nArtoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.\nFrom his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing for\ntakeoff.\nWEDGE\nGood luck, Luke.  See you at\nthe rendezvous.\nLuke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of\nhis X-wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently.\nLUKE\nDon't worry, Artoo.  We're going,\nwe're going.\nThe canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.",
  "Plain Of Hoth": "A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled\nrider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving\nplumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged\nbeast.\nThe rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling\noff his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the\nsky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and\nthrough them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.\nThe wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink\ntransmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.\nLUKE\n(into comlink)\nEcho Three to Echo Seven.  Han,\nold buddy, do you read me?\nAfter a little static a familiar voice is heard.\nHAN\n(over comlink)\nLoud and clear, kid.  What's up?\nLUKE\n(into comlink)\nWell, I finished my circle.  I\ndon't pick up any life readings.\nHAN\n(over comlink)\nThere isn't enough life on this\nice cube to fill a space cruiser.\nThe sensors are placed, I'm going\nback.\nLUKE\n(into comlink)\nRight.  I'll see you shortly.\nThere's a meteorite that hit the\nground near here.  I want to check\nit out.  It won't take long.\nLuke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.\nHe pats the beast on the head to calm it.\nLUKE\nHey, steady girl.  What's the\nmatter?  You smell something?\nLuke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when\nsuddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a\nmonstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over\nhim.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.\nLUKE\nAaargh!\nLuke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white\nclaw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified\nscreams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck\nbeing broken.\nThe Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away\nacross the frozen plain.\n\nThe Rebel transport and two escort fighters begin their departure from\nthe ice planet.",
  "Rebel Base": "Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base,\nwaiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes.  She shivers in the cold\nwind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands.  In the\nbackground, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors.\nA Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with\nthe princess.\nLIEUTENANT\nSir, all the patrols are in.\nThere's still no contact from\nSkywalker or Solo.\nTHREEPIO\nMistress Leia, Artoo says he's been\nquite unable to pick up any signals,\nalthough he does admit that his own\nrange is far too weak to abandon\nall hope.\nLeia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.\nDERLIN\nYour Highness, there's nothing\nmore we can do tonight.  The shield\ndoors must be closed.\nHe turns to the lieutenant.\nDERLIN\nClose the doors.\nLIEUTENANT\nYes, sir.\nThe lieutenant walks away.  Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl,\nsomewhat like a coyote.  At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex\nseries of efficient beeps.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo says the chances of survival\nare seven hundred seventy-five...\nto one.\nLeia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the\nentrance of the ice cave.  The loud booms echo throughout the huge\ncavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl.\nTHREEPIO\nActually, Artoo has been known to\nmake mistakes... from time to time.\nOh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry\nabout Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll\nbe all right.  He's quite clever,\nyou know... for a human being.\n\nStrange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment.  A switch\nis thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank\nfilled with a thick, gelatinous slime.  He begins to thrash about,\nraving in delirium.\n\nLuke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling.  His face shows\nterrible wounds from the Wampa's attack.  Threepio and Artoo enter the\nroom.\nTHREEPIO\nMaster Luke, sir, it's so good\nto see you fully functional again.\nArtoo beeps his good wishes.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo expresses his relief, also.\nHan and Chewie make their entrance.  The Wookiee growls a greeting.\nHAN\nHow are you feeling, kid?  You\ndon't look so bad to me.  In\nfact, you look strong enough to\npull the ears off a Gundark.\nLUKE\nThanks to you.\nHAN\nThat's two you owe me, junior.\nHan turns as Leia enters the room.  He looks at her with a big,\ndevilish grin.\nHAN\nWell your Worship, looks like\nyou managed to keep me around for\na little while longer.\nLEIA\n(haughtily)\nI had nothing to do with it.  General\nRieekan thinks it's dangerous for\nany ships to leave the system until\nwe've activated the energy shield.\nHAN\nThat's a good story.  I think you\njust can't bear to let a gorgeous\nguy like me out of your sight.\nLEIA\nI don't know where you get your\ndelusions, laser brain.\nChewie is amused; he laughs in his manner.  Han, enjoying himself,\nregards Chewie good-humoredly.\nHAN\nLaugh it up, fuzzball.  But you\ndidn't see us alone in the south\npassage.\nLuke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.\nHAN\nShe expressed her true feelings\nfor me.\nLeia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han.\nLEIA\nMy...!  Why, you stuck up,... half-\nwitted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-\nherder!\nHAN\nWho's scruffy-looking?\n(to Luke)\nI must have hit pretty close to\nthe mark to get her all riled up\nlike that, huh, kid?\nLeia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she\nfocuses on Luke.\nLEIA\nWhy, I guess you don't know\neverything about women yet?\nWith that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips.  Then she turns\non her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly\ndumbstruck.  With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head\nand grins.\nSuddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.\nANNOUNCER\n(over loudspeaker)\nHeadquarters personnel, report to\ncommand center.\nThe voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry\nout of the room, bidding farewell to Luke.\nHAN\nTake it easy.\nTHREEPIO\nExcuse us, please.\n\nLuke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical\ndroid stands by.\nMEDICAL DROID\nSir, it will take quite a while\nto evacuate the T-forty- sevens.\nLUKE\nWell, forget the heavy equipment.\nThere's plenty of time to get the\nsmaller modules on the transports.\nMEDICAL DROID\nTake care, sir.\nLUKE\nThanks.\n\nPilots, gunners, and R2 units scurry about.  Luke, pulling on his\nheavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders.  He\nstops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon, where Han and Chewie are\ntrying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before.\nLUKE\nChewie, take care of yourself,\nokay?\nAs Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around Luke and\ngives him a tight hug.  Han is discussing the lifter with a repair\ndroid when he sees Luke.\nHAN\nHi, kid.\n(to droid)\nThere's got to be a reason for\nit.  Check it at the other end.\nWait a second.\n(to Luke)\nYou all right?\nLUKE\nYeah.\nHAN\nBe careful.\nLUKE\nYou, too.\nLuke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on.  After a few steps,\nhe stops and looks back.  Han glances up and the two exchange a silent\ncommunication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things,\nall difficult to verbalize.\n\nAlarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base.  In the control room, a\ncontroller urgently gestures for General Rieekan to check a computer\nscan.\nCONTROLLER\nGeneral, there's a fleet of Star\nDestroyers coming out of hyperspace\nin sector four.\nRIEEKAN\nReroute all power to the energy\nshield.  We've got to hold them till\nall transports are away.  Prepare\nfor ground assault.\nRieekan exits hurriedly.\n\nWith a sense of urgency, Leia quickly briefs a group of pilots gathered\nin the center of the hangar.\nLEIA\nAll troop carriers will assemble\nat the north entrance.  The heavy\ntransport ships will leave as\nsoon as they're loaded.  Only two\nfighter escorts per ship.  The\nenergy shield can only be opened\nfor a short time, so you'll have\nto stay very close to your transports.\nHOBBIE\nTwo fighters against a Star Destroyer?\nLEIA\nThe ion cannon will fire several\nshots to make sure that any enemy\nships will be out of your flight\npath.  When you've gotten past the\nenergy shield, proceed directly to\nthe rendezvous point.  Understood?\nPILOTS\n(in unison)\nRight.  Okay.\nLEIA\nGood luck.\nDERLIN\nOkay.  Everyone to your stations.\nLet's go!\nThe pilots hurry away.\n\nThe long line of Rebel controllers is tense, as are Princess Leia and\nGeneral Rieekan, who are trying very hard not to show any fear.\nRIEEKAN\nTheir primary target will be the\npower generators.  Prepare to\nopen the shield.\n\nWOMAN CONTROLLER\nStand by, ion control... Fire!\n\nThe giant ball-shaped ion cannon rotates into position and blasts two\nred energy beams skyward.\n\nPilots, gunners, and troopers hurry to their stations and their\nvehicles.\nANNOUNCER\n(over loudspeaker)\nThe first transport is away.\nEveryone cheers at the announcement, which echoes through the hangar.\nLuke turns and walks on, heading toward his snowspeeder.  His gunner,\nDack, a fresh-faced, eager kid, is glad to see him.  They climb in.\nDACK\nFeeling all right, sir?\nLUKE\nJust like new, Dack.  How about\nyou?\nDACK\nRight now I feel like I could take\non the whole Empire myself.\nLUKE\n(quietly, strapping\nin)\nI know what you mean.\n\nPilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders.  Ice and snow\nbegin falling from the walls of the corridor, shaken by the pounding\nImperial snow walker as they draw ever nearer.\nTRENCH OFFICER\n(over comlink)\nWe have spotted Imperial walkers!\nCONTROLLER\nImperial walkers on the north\nridge.\n\nLarge chunks of ice tumble into the command center as Leia and General\nRieekan monitor computer screens.\nRIEEKAN\nI don't think we can protect two\ntransports at a time.\nLEIA\nIt's risky, but we can't hold out\nmuch longer.  We have no choice.\nRIEEKAN\n(into comlink)\nLaunch patrols.\nLEIA\n(to an aide)\nEvacuate remaining ground staff.\n\nMuffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the ice roof of\nthe hangar.  Trying to ignore the noise and falling bits of snow, Han\nworks on one of the Falcon's lifters while Chewie works on one of the\nwings.  Noticing Chewie attach a wrong part, Han grows impatient.\nHAN\nNo, no!  No!  This one goes there,\nthat one goes there.  Right?\nIn another area of the hangar, Threepio watches as Artoo is raised up\ninto Luke's X-wing fighter.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, you take good care of\nMaster Luke now, understand?  And\n... do take good care of yourself.\nOh, dear, oh, dear.\n\nApart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is\nstrangely quiet and empty.  Running footsteps echo through the freezing\nhallway, then Han appears.  Cracks have appeared in some of the walls\nand some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the\nunderground hallways.  Han hurries into the command center.  It is a\nshambles, but some people are still at their posts.  As he enters, a\ngigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room.  He finds Leia and\nThreepio near one of the control boards.\nHAN\nYou all right?\nLeia nods.  She is surprised to see him.\nLEIA\nWhy are you still here?\nHAN\nI heard the command center had\nbeen hit.\nLEIA\nYou got your clearance to leave.\nHAN\nDon't worry.  I'll leave.  First\nI'm going to get you to your ship.\nTHREEPIO\nYour Highness, we must take this\nlast transport.  It's our only hope.\nLEIA\n(to controller)\nSend all troops in sector twelve\nto the south slope to protect the\nfighters.\nA blast rocks the command center, throwing Threepio backward into Han's\narms.\nANNOUNCER\n(over loudspeaker)\nImperial troops have entered the\nbase.\nHAN\nCome on... that's it.\nLEIA\n(to head controller)\nGive the evacuation code signal.\nAnd get to your transports!\nLeia looks exhausted.  Han grabs her and starts to lead her out.\nAs Han, Leia, and Threepio run out of the command center, the code\nsignal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls.\nHEAD CONTROLLER\nK-one-zero... all troops disengage.\nTHREEPIO\n(to Han and Leia)\nOh!  Wait for me!\n\nA distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck.  Ice cakes come\ncrashing down on the Millennium Falcon.\n\nMore stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by Vader.\nHearing the loud roar of the Millennium Falcon's engines, Vader looks\ntoward the main hangar doors just in time to see the Falcon lift up and\ndisappear outside the cave.",

  "Vader's Star Destroyer": "Controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear\nominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls.  The\nsquat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built\nGeneral Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the\napproaching presence and turn toward it.  Darth Vader, Lord of the\nSith, enters like a chill wind.  As Vader moves across the wide bridge,\nCaptain Piett hurries up to Ozzel.\nPIETT\nAdmiral.\nOZZEL\nYes, Captain\nPIETT\nI think we've got something, sir.\nThe report is only a fragment from\na probe droid in the Hoth system,\nbut it's the best lead we've had.\nOZZEL\n(irritated)\nWe have thousands of probe droids\nsearching the galaxy.  I want proof,\nnot leads!\nPIETT\nThe visuals indicate life readings.\nOZZEL\nIt could mean anything.  If we\nfollowed every lead...\nPIETT\nBut, sir, the Hoth system is supposed\nto be devoid of human forms.\nVader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel snow base.\nRebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance.\nVADER\nYou found something?\nPIETT\nYes, my lord.\nVADER\n(studying the image\non the console screen)\nThat's it.  The Rebels are there.\nOZZEL\nMy lord, there are so many uncharted\nsettlements.  It could be smugglers,\nit could be...\nVADER\nThat is the system.  And I'm sure\nSkywalker is with them.  Set your\ncourse for the Hoth system.  General\nVeers, prepare you men.\n\nThe dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls\non the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube.\nGeneral Veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving\nVader.  Although seemingly very sure of himself, Veers is still not\nbold enough to interrupt the meditating lord.  The younger general\nstands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks.\nVADER\nWhat is it, General?\nVEERS\nMy lord, the fleet has moves out\nof light-speed.  Com-Scan has\ndetected an energy field protecting\nan area around the sixth planet of\nthe Hoth system.  The field is\nstrong enough to deflect any\nbombardment.\nVADER\n(angrily)\nThe Rebels are alerted to our\npresence.  Admiral Ozzel came out\nof light-speed too close to the\nsystem.\nVEERS\nHe felt surprise was wiser...\nVADER\nHe is as clumsy as he is stupid.\nGeneral, prepare your troops for a\nsurface attack.\nVEERS\nYes, my lord.\nVeers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen\nshowing the bridge of his mighty ship.  Admiral Ozzel appears on the\nviewscreen, standing slightly in front of Captain Piett.\nOZZEL\nLord Vader, the fleet has moved\nout of light-speed, and we're\npreparing to... Aaagh!\nVADER\nYou have failed me for the last\ntime, Admiral.  Captain Piett.\nPiett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly confused,\ntouching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully.\nPIETT\nYes, my lord.\nVADER\nMake ready to land out troops beyond\nthe energy shield and deploy the\nfleet so that nothing gets off that\nsystem.  You are in command now,\nAdmiral Piett.\nPIETT\nThank you, Lord Vader.\nPiett's pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed\nemotion.  He glances warily at the struggling Admiral Ozzel who, with a\nfinal choke, stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him.\n\nAdmiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.\nAfter a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising\nsight before him.\nDarth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far\nside of the chamber.  A black, insectlike droid attends him.  Among the\nvarious apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts\nfrom Vader's uncovered head.  The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar\ntissue covering it.  The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet\nonto Vader's head.  When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face\nPiett.\nVADER\nYes, Admiral?\nPIETT\nOur ships have sighted the\nMillennium Falcon, lord.  But...\nit has entered an asteroid field\nand we cannot risk...\nVADER\n(interrupting)\nAsteroids do not concern me,\nAdmiral.  I want that ship and\nnot excuses.\nPIETT\nYes, lord.\n\nAsteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge\nwindow.  Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control\ndeck.  Then slowly turns toward the bridge.  Before him are the\nhologram images of twenty battleship commanders.  One of these images,\nthe commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly.\nAnother image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is\nfaded and continually disrupted by static.  It is the image of Captain\nNeeda, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the\nMillennium Falcon.  Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark\nLord.\nNEEDA\n(in hologram)\n... and that, Lord Vader, was the\nlast time they appeared in any of\nour scopes.  Considering the amount\nof damage we've sustained, they\nmust have been destroyed.\nVADER\nNo, Captain, they're alive.  I\nwant every ship available to\nsweep the asteroid field until\nthey are found.\nThe Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to\nAdmiral Piett.\nPIETT\nLord Vader.\nVADER\nYes, Admiral, what is it?\nThe admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.\nPIETT\nThe Emperor commands you make\ncontact with him.\nVADER\nMove the ship out of the asteroid\nfield so that we can send a clear\ntransmission.\nPIETT\nYes, my lord.\n\nThe Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber.  A strange sound\nenters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure.\nHe looks up and bows quickly.\nA twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before\nVader.  The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the\ncloak worn by Ben Kenobi.  His voice is even deeper and more\nfrightening than Vader's.\nVADER\nWhat is thy bidding, my master?\nEMPEROR\nThere is a great disturbance in\nthe Force.\nVADER\nI have felt it.\nEMPEROR\nWe have a new enemy - Luke\nSkywalker.\nVADER\nYes, my master.\nEMPEROR\nHe could destroy us.\nVADER\nHe's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no\nlonger help him.\nEMPEROR\nThe Force is strong with him.  The\nson of Skywalker must not become a\nJedi.\nVADER\nIf he could be turned, he would\nbecome a powerful ally.\nEMPEROR\nYes.  Yes.  He would be a great\nasset.  Can it be done?\nVADER\nHe will join us or die, my\nmaster.\nVader kneels.  The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord\nof the Sith and fades away.\n\nVader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge with a\nmotley group of men and creatures.  Admiral Piett and two controllers\nstand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn.\nPIETT\nBounty hunters.  We don't need\nthat scum.\nFIRST CONTROLLER\nYes, sir.\nPIETT\nThose Rebels won't escape us.\nA second controller interrupts.\nSECOND CONTROLLER\nSir, we have a priority signal\nfrom the Star Destroyer Avenger.\nPIETT\nRight.\nThe group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune\nhunters  There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge,\nbloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle-\nscarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war\ndroid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.\nVADER\n... there will be a substantial\nreward for the one who finds the\nMillennium Falcon.  You are free\nto use any methods necessary, but\nI want them alive.  No disintegrations.\nBOBA FETT\nAs you wish.\nAt that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement.\nPIETT\nLord Vader!  My lord, we have\nthem.\n\nVADER\nApology accepted, Captain Needa.\nClutching desperately at his throat, Captain Needa slumps down, then\nfalls over on his back, at the feet of Darth Vader.  Two stormtroopers\npick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as Admiral Piett\nand two of his captains hurry up to the Dark Lord.\nPIETT\nLord Vader, our ships have\ncompleted their scan of the area\nand found nothing.  If the\nMillennium Falcon went into light-\nspeed, it'll be on the other side\nof the galaxy by now.\nVADER\nAlert all commands.  Calculate\nevery possible destination along\ntheir last know trajectory.\nPIETT\nYes, my lord.  We'll find them.\nVADER\nDon't fail me again, Admiral.\nVader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more uneasy than\nwhen he arrived.\nPIETT\nAlert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.\n\nVader stands on the bridge looking out the window as Admiral Piett\napproaches him.\nPIETT\nThey'll be in range of our\ntractor beam in moments, my lord.\nVADER\nDid your men deactivate the\nhyperdrive on the Millennium\nFalcon?\nPIETT\nYes, my lord.\nVADER\nGood.  Prepare the boarding party\nand set your weapons for stun.\nPIETT\nYes, my lord.\n\nVader stands on the bridge, watching as the Millennium Falcon is chased\nby the TIE fighters.  As his Destroyer draws nearer, Vader's breathing\ngets slightly faster.\nVADER\nLuke.\n\nVADER\nSon, come with me.\n\nVADER\nLuke... it is your destiny.\n\nPIETT\nAlert all commands.  Ready for\nthe tractor beam.\n\nAdmiral Piett and another captain glance at Vader in terror.  Vader\nturns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands held behind his back\nin a contemplative gesture.\n\nLord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star.\nNow, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment\nof stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL\nPIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen\nearlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.\nVADER\nWhere is that shuttle going?\nPIETT\t (into comlink)\nShuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?\nPILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered)\nParts and technical crew for the forest moon.\nThe Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.\nVADER\nDo they have a code clearance?\nPIETT\nIt's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.\nVader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.\nPIETT\nShall I hold them?\nVADER\nNo. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.\nPIETT\t (surprised)\nAs you wish, my lord.\n(to controller)\nCarry on.\nPiett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.\n\nAdmiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the\nbattle. They look concerned.\nCONTROLLER\nSir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.\nPIETT\nIntensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.\nThe commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel\nfighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.\nPIETT\nIntensify forward firepower!\nCOMMANDER\nIt's too late!\nThe Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer, causing a\nhuge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the\nDeath Star, and explodes.",

  "Asteroid Cave": "The Falcon races down into the crater.  The walls are barely visible as\nthe ship speed through the tunnellike opening.  A small cave appears on\none side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into\nit.\n\nThe pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave.  It is so\ndark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.\n\nThe cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the\ncontrol panel.  Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat.\nShe runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the\nconfusion he has created within her.  Suddenly, something outside the\ncockpit window catches her eye.  The reflection of the panel lights\nobscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the\nwindscreen.  Leia\nmoves closer to see what it might be.  Large, yellow eyes flash open\nand stare back at her.  Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her\nheart pounding.  There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in\nan instant the eyes are gone.  The young princess catches her breath,\njumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit.\n\nThe lights go bright for a second then out again.  Threepio and\nChewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires.\nTHREEPIO\nSir, if I may venture an opinion...\nHAN\nI'm not really interested in your\nopinion, Threepio.\nLeia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into\nplace.\nLEIA\n(out of breath)\nThere's something out there.\nHAN\nWhere?\nLEIA\nOutside, in the cave.\nAs she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull.  Chewie looks\nup and barks anxiously.\nTHREEPIO\nThere it is.  Listen!  Listen!\nHAN\nI'm going out there.\nLEIA\nAre you crazy?!\nHAN\nI just got this bucket back\ntogether.  I'm not going to let\nsomething tear it apart.\nHe and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out.  Leia\nfollows.\nLEIA\nThen I'm going with you.\nTHREEPIO\nI think it might be better if I\nstay here and guard the ship.\n(hears another\nmysterious noise)\nOh, no.\n\nIt is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is\nattacking the ship.\nLeia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.\nLEIA\nThis ground sure feels strange.\nIt doesn't feel like rock at all.\nHan kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline\nof the cave.\nHAN\nThere's an awful lot of moisture\nin here.\nLEIA\nI don't know.  I have a bad feeling\nabout this.\nHAN\nYeah.\nChewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's\ncockpit.  A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of\nthe Falcon.  The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it\nwith a laser bolt.\nHAN\n(to Leia)\nWatch out!\nThe black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front\nof the princess.  Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.\nHAN\nYeah, that's what I thought.\nMynock.  Chewie, check the rest\nof the ship, make sure there\naren't any more attached.  They're\nchewing on the power cables.\nLEIA\nMynocks?\nHAN\nGo on inside.  We'll clean them\noff if there are any more.\nJust then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air.  Leia\nputs her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the\nship.  Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster.  Several of\nthe batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit\nwindow of the Falcon.  Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.\nTHREEPIO\nOhhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly\nlittle thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!\nHan looks around the strange, dripping cave.\nHAN\nWait a minute...\nHe unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.\nThe cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.\nChewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han.\nThe large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their\nfaces and run up the platform.\n\nAs soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch.\nThe ship continues to shake and heave.\nHAN\nAll right, Chewie, let's get\nout of here!\nThe Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes\nto the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel.  Leia\nhurries after.\nLEIA\nThe Empire is still out there.\nI don't think it's wise to...\nHan rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.\nHAN\n(interrupting)\nNo time to discuss this in\ncommittee.\nAnd with that he is gone.  The main engines of the Falcon begin to\nwhine.  Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.\nLEIA\n(angry)\nI am not a committee!\n\nHan is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle.  The\ncave-quake has greatly diminished.\nLEIA\nYou can't make the jump to light-\nspeed in this asteroid field...\nHAN\nSit down, sweetheart.  We're\ntaking off!\nAs the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks.  He notices something\nout the window ahead.  Threepio sees it too.\nTHREEPIO\nLook!\nHAN\nI see it, I see it.\nSuddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen\nsurrounding the entrance.  And as the Falcon moves forward, the\nentrance to the cave grows ever smaller.  Han pulls hard on the\nthrottle, sending his ship surging forward.\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed!\nLEIA\nThe cave is collapsing.\nHAN\nThis is no cave.\nLEIA\nWhat?\nLeia's mouth drops open .  She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance\nare not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly closing around the tiny\nship.  Chewie howls.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on\nits side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth\nbefore the huge jaws slams closed.\n\nThe enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon\nflies out of its mouth.  The monster tilts its head, watching the\nstarship fly away.",
  "Dagobah": "The mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog.\nLuke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out\nof his cubbyhole on the back.  The young warrior surveys the fog, which\nis barely pierced by the ship's landing lights.  About all he can make\nout are some giant, twisted trees nearby.  Artoo whistles anxiously.\nLUKE\nNo, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll\nhave a look around.\nArtoo lets out a short beep.  As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses\nhis balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.\nLUKE\nArtoo?\nLuke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water\nis still and reveals no sign of the little droid.\nLUKE\nArtoo!  Where are you?\nA small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is\nheard.  The periscope starts to move to shore.  Relieved, Luke starts\nrunning along the nose of the fighter to its tip.\nLUKE\nArtoo!  You be more careful.\nThe outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.\nLuke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and\nturns to look for Artoo.  The periscope still steadily moves toward\nshore.\nLUKE\nArtoo - that way!\nSuddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving\ntoward the little droid.  The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the\nswampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.  The\ndroid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.\nHolding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into\nthe murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.\nLUKE\nArtoo!\nThe black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin\nto appear.  Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the\nwater, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of\nsoft gray moss.\nLUKE\nOh, no!  Are you all right?  Come\non.  You're lucky you don't taste\nvery good.  Anything broken?\nLuke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from\nhis round metal body.  Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.\nLUKE\nIf you're saying coming here was\na bad idea, I'm beginning to agree\nwith you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we\ndoing here?  It's like... something\nout of a dream, or, I don't know.\nMaybe I'm just going crazy.\nAs Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him,\nArtoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.\n\nThe mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking\nswamp.\nLuke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.  He ignites\na little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it.  Taking a power\ncable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.\nLUKE\nReady for some power?  Okay.\nLet's see now.  Put that in\nthere.  There you go.\nThe droid whistles his appreciation.  Luke then opens a container of\nprocessed food and sits before the thermal heater.\nLUKE\n(sighs)\nNow all I have to do is find this\nYoda... if he even exists.\nNervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.\nLUKE\nStill... there's something familiar\nabout this place.  I feel like...\nI don't know...\nSTRANGE VOICE\nFeel like what?\nLuke jumps out of his skin.  Artoo screeches in terror.  The young\nwarrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the\nspeaker.  Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange,\nbluish creature, not more than two feet tall.  The wizened little thing\nis dressed in rags.  It motions toward Luke's sword.\nLUKE\n(looking at the\ncreature)\nLike we're being watched!\nCREATURE\nAway with your weapon!  I mean\nyou no harm.\nAfter some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really\ndoesn't understand why.  Artoo watches with interest.\nCREATURE\nI am wondering, why are you here?\nLUKE\nI'm looking for someone.\nCREATURE\nLooking?  Found someone, you have,\nI would say, hmmm?\nThe little creature laughs.\nLUKE\n(Trying to keep from\nsmiling)\nRight.\nCREATURE\nHelp you I can.  Yes, mmmm.\nLUKE\nI don't think so.  I'm looking\nfor a great warrior.\nCREATURE\nAhhh!  A great warrior.\n(laughs and shakes\nhis head)\nWars not make one great.\nWith the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of\nthe cases of supplies.  He begins to rummage around.\nArtoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the\ncreature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his\ndisapproval.\nTheir tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from\nand takes a bite.\nLUKE\nPut that down.  Hey!  That's my\ndinner!\nThe creature spits out the bite he has taken.  He makes a face.\nCREATURE\nHow you get so big, eating food\nof this kind?\nHe flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of\nLuke's supply cases.\nLUKE\nListen, friend, we didn't mean to\nland in that puddle, and if we\ncould get our ship out, we would,\nbut we can't, so why don't you just...\nCREATURE\n(teasing)\nAww, cannot get your ship out?\nThe creature spots something of interest in Luke's case.  Luke loses\npatience and grabs the case away.  The creature retains his prize - a\ntiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.\nLUKE\nHey, you could have broken this.\nDon't do that.  Ohhh... you're\nmaking a mess.  Hey, give me that!\nCREATURE\n(retreating with\nthe lamp)\nMine!  Or I will help you not.\nClutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing\ncloser to Artoo.  As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little\narms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by\nthe creature.\nLUKE\nI don't want your help.  I want\nmy lamp back.  I'll need it to\nget out of this slimy mudhole.\nCREATURE\nMudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.\nArtoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately\nengaged in a tug-of-war over it.\nArtoo beeps a few angry, \"Give me thats.\"\nCREATURE\nAh, ah, ah!\nLUKE\nOh, Artoo, let him have it!\nCREATURE\nMine!  Mine!\nLUKE\nArtoo!\nCREATURE\nMine!\nThe creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one\nfinger.  Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.\nCREATURE\nMine!\nLUKE\n(fed up)\nNow will you move along, little\nfella?  We're got a lot of work\nto do.\nCREATURE\nNo!  No, no!  Stay and help you,\nI will.\n(laughs)\nFind your friend, hmm?\nLUKE\nI'm not looking for a friend.\nI'm looking for a Jedi Master.\nCREATURE\nOohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You\nseek Yoda.\nLUKE\nYou know him?\nCREATURE\nMmm.  Take you to him, I will.\n(laughs)\nYes, yes.  But now, we must eat.\nCome.  Good food.  Come.\nWith that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily.\nLuke stares after him.  All he sees is the faint light from the small\npower lamp moving through the fog.  Luke makes his decision and starts\nafter the creature.\nCREATURE\n(in the distance)\nCome, come.\nArtoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.\nLUKE\nStay here and watch after the\ncamp, Artoo.\nArtoo beeps even more frantically.  But as Luke disappears from view,\nthe worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic\nsigh.\n\nA heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees.  A strange\nbaroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small\nlagoon.  The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its\nthick glass windows.  As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head,\nthe stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of\nthe glowing portals.\n\nWith Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick\nvines that grow in the swamp.  Panting heavily, he continues his course\n- climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in\nand out of the heavy ground fog.\nYODA\nRun!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength\nflows from the Force.  But beware\nof the dark side.  Anger... fear...\naggression.  The dark side of\nthe Force are they.\nEasily they flow, quick to join\nyou in a fight.  If once you\nstart down the dark path, forever\nwill it dominate your destiny,\nconsume you it will, as it did\nObi-Wan's apprentice.\nLUKE\nVader.  Is the dark side stronger?\nYODA\nNo... no... no.  Quicker, easier,\nmore seductive.\nLUKE\nBut how am I to know the good side\nfrom the bad?\nYODA\nYou will know.  When you are calm,\nat peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses\nthe Force for knowledge and\ndefense, never for attack.\nLUKE\nBut tell me why I can't...\nYODA\n(interrupting)\nNo, no, there is no why.  Nothing\nmore will I teach you today.\nClear your mind of questions.\nMmm.  Mmmmmmmm.\nArtoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground.\nBreathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and\npulls it on.\nHe turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few\nfeet of water.  Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on\none side.  Luke stares at the tree, trembling.\nLUKE\nThere's something not right here.\nYoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.\nLUKE\nI feel cold, death.\nYODA\nThat place... is strong with the\ndark side of the Force.  A domain\nof evil it is.  In you must go.\nLUKE\nWhat's in there?\nYODA\nOnly what you take with you.\nLuke looks warily between the tree and Yoda.  He starts to strap on his\nweapon belt.\nYODA\nYour weapons... you will not\nneed them.\nLuke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head \"no.\"  Yoda\nshrugs.  Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters\nthe tree.\n\nLuke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave.\nThe youth can barely make out the edge of the passage.  Holding his lit\nsaber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and\na snake wrapped around the branches of a tree.  Luke draws a deep\nbreath, then pushes deeper into the cave.\nThe space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it.\nHis sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness.  It is\nvery quiet here.\nThen, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness,\nilluminated by his own just-ignited laser sword.  Immediately, he\ncharges Luke, saber held high.  He is upon the youth in seconds, but\nLuke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.\nVader is decapitated.  His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders\nas his body disappears into the darkness.  The metallic banging of the\nhelmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the\nfloor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it\ncracks vertically.  The black helmet and breath mask fall away to\nreveal... Luke's head.\nAcross the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in\nterror.\nThe decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.\n\nMeanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick.\n\nLuke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain.  He stands on\nhis hands, with Yoda perched on his feet.  Opposite Luke and Yoda are\ntwo rocks the size of bowling balls.  Luke stares at the rocks and\nconcentrates.  One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to\nrest on the other.\nYODA\nUse the Force.  Yes...\nYoda taps Luke's leg.  Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground.\nHis body wavers, but he maintains his balance.  Artoo, standing nearby,\nis whistling and beeping frantically.\nYODA\nNow... the stone.  Feel it.\nLuke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock.  It rises a few feet,\nshaking under the strain.  But, distracted by Artoo's frantic beeping,\nLuke loses his balance and finally collapses.  Yoda jumps clear.\nYODA\nConcentrate!\nAnnoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking\nurgently back and forth in front of him.\nArtoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the\nedge of the swamp.  Catching on, Luke rushes to the water's edge.  The\nX-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the\nlake's surface.\nLUKE\nOh, no.  We'll never get it out\nnow.\nYoda stamps his foot in irritation.\nYODA\nSo certain are you.  Always with\nyou it cannot be done.  Hear you\nnothing that I say?\nLuke looks uncertainly out at the ship.\nLUKE\nMaster, moving stones around is\none thing.  This is totally\ndifferent.\nYODA\nNo!  No different!  Only different\nin your mind.  You must unlearn\nwhat you have learned.\nLUKE\n(focusing, quietly)\nAll right, I'll give it a try.\nYODA\nNo!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.\nThere is no try.\nLuke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out.\nSlowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water.  It hovers\nfor a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again.\nLUKE\n(panting heavily)\nI can't.  It's too big.\nYODA\nSize matters not.  Look at me.\nJudge me by my size, do you?\nHm?  Mmmm.\nLuke shakes his head.\nYODA\nAnd well you should not.  For my\nally in the Force.  And a powerful\nally it is.  Life creates it, makes\nit grow.  Its energy surrounds us\nand binds us.  Luminous beings\nare we...\n(Yoda pinches\nLuke's shoulder)\n... not this crude matter.\n(a sweeping gesture)\nYou must feel the Force around you.\n(gesturing)\nHere, between you... me... the\ntree... the rock... everywhere!\nYes, even between this land and\nthat ship!\nLUKE\n(discouraged)\nYou want the impossible.\nQuietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter.  With his eyes closed and\nhis head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.\nSoon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo\nbeeps in terror and scoots away.\nThe entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore.  Yoda\nstands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the\nbeach.\nLuke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore.\nHe walks toward Yoda.\nLUKE\nI don't... I don't believe it.\nYODA\nThat is why you fail.\nLuke shakes his head, bewildered.\n\nIn the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but\nhis face shows less strain and more concentration than before.  Yoda\nsits on the ground below the young warrior.  On the other side of the\nclearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air.  Nearby Artoo\nwatches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air.\nHis little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically,\nlooking for help.\nYODA\nConcentrate... feel the Force\nflow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes.\nThrough the Force, things you\nwill see.  Other places.  The\nfuture... the past.  Old friends\nlong gone.\nLuke suddenly becomes distressed.\nLUKE\nHan!  Leia!\nThe two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then\nLuke himself tumbles over.\nYODA\n(shaking his head)\nHmm.  Control, control.  You must\nlearn control.\nLUKE\nI saw... I saw a city in the\nclouds.\nYODA\nMmm.  Friends you have there.\nLUKE\nThey were in pain.\nYODA\nIt is the future you see.\nLUKE\nFuture?  Will they die?\nYoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.\nYODA\nDifficult to see.  Always in\nmotion is the future.\nLUKE\nI've got to go to them.\nYODA\nDecide you must how to serve\nthem best.  If you leave now,\nhelp them you could.  But you\nwould destroy all for which they\nhave fought and suffered.\nLuke is stopped cold by Yoda's words.  Gloom shrouds him as he nods his\nhead sadly.\n\nIn the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy case into the\nbelly of the ship.  Artoo sits on top of the X-wing, settling down into\nhis cubbyhole.  Yoda stands nearby on a log.\nYODA\nLuke!  You must complete the\ntraining.\nLUKE\nI can't keep the vision out of my\nhead.  They're my friends.  I've\ngot to help them.\nYODA\nYou must not go!\nLUKE\nBut Han and Leia will die if I\ndon't.\nBEN'S VOICE\nYou don't know that.\nLuke looks toward the voice in amazement.  Ben has materialized as a\nreal, slightly shimmering image near Yoda.  The power of his presence\nstops Luke.\nBEN\nEven Yoda cannot see their fate.\nLUKE\nBut I can help them!  I feel\nthe Force!\nBEN\nBut you cannot control it.  This\nis a dangerous time for you,\nwhen you will be tempted by the\ndark side of the Force.\nYODA\nYes, yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen.\nThe cave.  Remember your failure\nat the cave!\nLUKE\nBut I've learned so much since\nthen.  Master Yoda, I promise to\nreturn and finish what I've begun.\nYou have my word.\nBEN\nIt is you and your abilities the\nEmperor wants.  that is why your\nfriends are made to suffer.\nLUKE\nAnd that is why I have to go.\nBEN\nLuke, I don't want to lose you to\nthe Emperor the way I lost Vader.\nLUKE\nYou won't.\nYODA\nStopped they must be.  On this\nall depends.  Only a fully trained\nJedi Knight with the Force as his\nally will conquer Vader and his\nEmperor.  If you end your training\nnow, if you choose the quick and\neasy path, as Vader did, you will\nbecome an agent of evil.\nBEN\nPatience.\nLUKE\nAnd sacrifice Han and Leia?\nYODA\nIf you honor what they fight for\n... yes!\nLuke is in great anguish.  He struggles with the dilemma, a battle\nraging in his mind.\nBEN\nIf you choose to face Vader, you\nwill do it alone.  I cannot\ninterfere.\nLUKE\nI understand.\n(he moves to his\nX-wing)\nArtoo, fire up the converters.\nArtoo whistles a happy reply.\nBEN\nLuke, don't give in to hate -\nthat leads to the dark side.\nLuke nods and climbs into his ship.\nYODA\nStrong is Vader.  Mind what you\nhave learned.  Save you it can.\nLUKE\nI will.  And I'll return.  I promise.\nArtoo closes the cockpit.  Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of\nthe engines and the wind engulf them.\nYODA\n(sighs)\nTold you, I did.  Reckless is\nhe.  Now matters are worse.\nBEN\nThat boy is our last hope.\nYODA\n(looks up)\nNo.  There is another.",
  "Creature's House": "Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very\nplain, but cozy dwelling.  Everything is in the same small scale as the\ncreature.  The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke,\nwhose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower.  He sits\ncross-legged on the floor of the living room.\nThe creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up\nan incredible meal.  The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and\npans.  The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding\nthat, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices.  He rushes\nback and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who\nwatches the creature impatiently.\nLUKE\nLook, I'm sure it's delicious.\nI just don't understand why we\ncan't see Yoda now.\nCREATURE\nPatience!  For the Jedi it is\ntime to eat as well.  Eat, eat.\nHot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?\nMoving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down\nnear the fire and serves himself from the pot.  Tasting the unfamiliar\nconcoction, he is pleasantly surprised.\nLUKE\nHow far away is Yoda?  Will it\ntake us long to get there?\nCREATURE\nNot far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.\nSoon you will be with him.\n(tasting food from\nthe pot)\nRootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you\nbecome Jedi?  Hm?\nLUKE\nMostly because of my father, I\nguess.\nCREATURE\nAh, your father.  Powerful Jedi\nwas he, powerful Jedi, mmm.\nLUKE\n(a little angry)\nOh, come on.  How could you know\nmy father?  You don't even know\nwho I am.\n(fed up)\nOh, I don't know what I'm doing\nhere.  We're wasting our time.\nThe creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.\nCREATURE\n(irritated)\nI cannot teach him.  The boy has\nno patience.\nLuke's head spins in the direction the creature faces.  But there is no\none there.  The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that\nthe little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking\nwith Ben.\nBEN'S VOICE\nHe will learn patience.\nYODA\nHmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father.\nBEN'S VOICE\nWas I any different when you\ntaught me?\nYODA\nHah.  He is not ready.\nLUKE\nYoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I\ncan be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm\nready.\nTrying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low\nceiling.\nYODA\nReady, are you?  What know you\nof ready?  For eight hundred years\nhave I trained Jedi.  My own counsel\nwill I keep on who is to be trained!\nA Jedi must have the deepest\ncommitment, the most serious mind.\n(to the invisible\nBen, indicating Luke)\nThis one a long time have I watched.\nAll his life has he looked away...\nto the future, to the horizon.\nNever his mind on where he was.\nHmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph.\nAdventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh!\nA Jedi craves not these things.\n(turning to Luke)\nYou are reckless!\nLuke looks down.  He knows it is true.\nBEN'S VOICE\nSo was I, if you'll remember.\nYODA\nHe is too old.  Yes, too old to\nbegin the training.\nLuke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice.\nLUKE\nBut I've learned so much.\nYoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge\neyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned.  After a\nlong moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.\nYODA\n(sighs)\nWill he finished what he begins?\nLUKE\nI won't fail you - I'm not afraid.\nYODA\n(turns slowly toward\nhim)\nOh, you will be.  You will be.",
  "Star Destroyer, Avenger": "The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a\nfiring Imperial Star Destroyer.  A large asteroid about the same size\nas the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship.  The tiny Falcon\nbanks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface.\nThen the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly\non the hull of the vast Star Destroyer.\n\nThe tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge.  The Imperials\nstationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low\nacross the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge\narea.  Alarms go off everywhere.  The Destroyer's commander, Captain\nNeeda, can scarcely believe his eyes.\nNEEDA\nThey're moving to attack\nposition!  Shields up!\nNeeda and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window.

  "Cloud City": "The powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward\nthe soft pink planet of Bespin.\n\nIt is down on the gaseous planet.  Huge billowing clouds form a canyon\nas the ship banks around them, heading toward the system's Cloud City.\nSuddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward the Falcon.\nThe cloud cars draw up alongside the starship.\n\nThe clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out\nof the cloud surface.  The cloud cars and the Falcon head for the\ngleaming white metropolis.\n\nWith the cloud cars still guarding it, the Falcon lands on one of the\nCloud City's platforms.\n\nLando Calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his thirties, leads a\ngroup of aides and some Cloud City guard rapidly toward the landing\nplatform.\nThe group, like the other citizens of the city, is a motley collection\nof aliens, droids, and humans of all descriptions.  Lando has a grim\nexpression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform.\n\nLando stops ten feet from Han.  The two men eye each other carefully.\nLando shakes his head.\nLANDO\nWhy, you slimy, double-crossing,\nno-good swindler!  You've got a\nlot of guts coming here, after\nwhat you pulled.\nHan points to himself innocently, mouthing, \"Me?\"\nLando moves threateningly toward Han.  Suddenly, he throws his arms\naround his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him.\nLANDO\n(laughs)\nHow you doing, you old pirate?\nSo good to see you!  I never thought\nI'd catch up with you again.  Where\nyou been?\nThe two old friends embrace, laughing and chuckling.\n\nLANDO\nWhat are you doing here?\nHAN\n(gestures toward\nthe Falcon)\nAhh... repairs.  I thought you\ncould help me out.\nLANDO\n(in mock panic)\nWhat have you done to my ship?\nHAN\nYour ship?  Hey, remember, you\nlost her to me fair and square.\nChewie growls a reserved greeting.  Lando suddenly notices the princess\nand smiles.\nLANDO\nHello.  What have we here?\nWelcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian.\nI'm the administrator of this\nfacility.  And who might you be?\nLEIA\nLeia.\nLANDO\nWelcome, Leia.\nLando bows before Leia and kisses her hand.\nHAN\nAll right, all right, you old\nsmoothie.\nHan takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando.\nTHREEPIO\nHello, sir.  I am See-Threepio,\nhuman-cyborg relations.  My\nfacilities are at your...\nBefore Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has turned to\nfollow Han and Leia, who are walking toward the city.\nTHREEPIO\nWell, really!\nLando, his aide, Lobot, and Han lead the way across the bridge,\nfollowed by Threepio, Chewie and Leia.\nLANDO\nWhat's wrong with the Falcon?\nHAN\nHyperdrive.\nLANDO\nI'll get my people to work on it.\nHAN\nGood.\nLando turns to Leia.\nLANDO\nYou know, that ship saved my life\nquite a few times.  She's the\nfastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.\n\nThe group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city.  They\nwalk down the lovely Art Deco passageway, rounding several corners and\npassing many small plazas as they go.  Threepio lags a bit behind.\nHAN\nHow's the gas mine?  Is it\npaying off for you?\nLANDO\nOh, not as well as I'd like.\nWe're a small outpost and not\nvery self-sufficient.  And I've\nhad supply problems of every kind.\nI've had labor difficulties...\n(catches Han\ngrinning at him)\nWhat's so funny?\nHAN\nYou.  Listen to you - you sound\nlike a businessman, a responsible\nleader.  Who'd have thought that,\nhuh?\nLando is reflective.  He looks at Han a moment.\nLANDO\nYou know, seeing you sure\nbrings back a few things.\nHAN\nYeah.\nLANDO\n(shakes his head)\nYeah.  I'm responsible these days.\nIt's the price you pay for being\nsuccessful.\nHan and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the\ncorridor.\nThe lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid who is coming\nout of a door.\nTHREEPIO\nOh!  Nice to see a familiar face.\nSECOND THREEPIO\n(mumbles)\nE chu ta!\nTHREEPIO\nHow rude!\nThreepio stops, watching the silver droid move away.  Then he hears the\nmuffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit coming from within the\nroom.\n\nCurious, Threepio enters the room.\nTHREEPIO\nThat sounds like an R2 unit in\nthere.  I wonder if...\nThreepio walks through the doorway to the main room.  He looks in.\nTHREEPIO\nHello?  How interesting.  Oh, my.\nMAN'S VOICE\n(from within)\nWho are you?\nTHREEPIO\nOh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I\ndidn't mean to intrude.  No, no,\nplease don't get up.  No!\nA laser bolt to Threepio's chest sends him flying in twenty directions.\nSmoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door\nwhooshes closed behind him.\n\nLando, Han, and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of Threepio's\ndreadful accident.  Chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but\nshrugs his shoulders and follows the group.\n\nWithin the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in\nagitation.  She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a\nlovely dress.  Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons.  She moves\nfrom a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the\ndoorway.\nHAN\nThe ship is almost finished.\nTwo or Three more things and\nwe're in great shape.\nLEIA\nThe sooner the better.  Something's\nwrong here.  No one has seen or\nknows anything about Threepio.\nHe's been gone too long to have\ngotten lost.\nHan takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead.\nHAN\nRelax.  I'll talk to Lando and\nsee what I can find out.\nLEIA\nI don't trust Lando.\nHAN\nWell, I don't trust him, either.\nBut he is my friend.  Besides,\nwe'll soon be gone.\nLEIA\nAnd then you're as good as gone,\naren't you?\nNot speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face.\n\nThe room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts.  Four\nUgnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some\npieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten\nmetal.  Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt.  Chewie\nenters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting\nThreepio's head.  The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught,\nthen reaches to grab the head.  But the Ugnaught tosses it away from\nhim to another Ugnaught.  This game of keep-away goes on until\nThreepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the\nground.\n\nThe door zaps open.  Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of\nThreepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.\nLEIA\nWhat happened?\nChewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.\nHAN\nWhere?  Found him in a junk pile?\nLEIA\nOh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you\nthink you can repair him?\nThe giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts.  He looks at the\nprincess and shrugs sadly.\nHAN\nLando's got people who can fix\nhim.\nLEIA\nNo, thanks.\nThere is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando.\nLANDO\nI'm sorry.  Am I interrupting\nanything?\nLEIA\nNot really.\nLANDO\nYou look absolutely beautiful.\nYou truly belong here with us\namong the clouds.\nLEIA\n(coolly)\nThank you.\nLANDO\nWill you join me for a little\nrefreshment?\nHan looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the mention of\nfood and licks his lips.\nLANDO\nEveryone's invited, of course.\nLeia takes Lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to go.  Lando\nspots Threepio's remains.\nLANDO\nHaving trouble with you droid?\nHan and Leia exchange a quick glance.\nHAN\nNo.  No problem.  Why?\nHan and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and\nChewie.  The door slides closed behind them.\n\nLeia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance\nbehind.  Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall,\npure-white columns.\nLANDO\nSo you see, since we're a small\noperation, we don't fall into\nthe... uh... jurisdiction of the\nEmpire.\nLEIA\nSo you're part of the mining\nguild then?\nLANDO\nNo, not actually.  Our operation\nis small enough not to be noticed...\nwhich is advantageous for everybody\nsince our customers are anxious\nto avoid attracting attention to\nthemselves.\nThe group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at\nthe far end.\nHAN\nAren't you afraid the Empire's\ngoing to find out about this\nlittle operation and shut you down?\nLANDO\nThat's always been a danger looming\nlike a shadow over everything we've\nbuilt here.  But things have\ndeveloped that will insure security.\nI've just made a deal that will\nkeep the Empire out of here forever.\n\nThe mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the\ndining room.  At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader.\nStanding at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty\nhunter.\nFaster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a\ncouple of shots directly at Vader.  The Dark Lord quickly raises his\nhand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they\nexplode harmlessly.  Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's\nhand.  The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of\nhim.\nVADER\nWe would be honored if you would\njoin us.\nHan gives Lando a mean look.\nLANDO\nI had no choice.  They arrived\nright before you did.  I'm sorry.\nHAN\nI'm sorry, too.\n\nChewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell.  The stark room is flooded\nwith hot light.  To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle\nscreeches loudly.  Chewie is going mad.  He hits the wall with giant\nfists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor.  The upper\nlights go off abruptly.  The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a\nwall, where he listens for a moment.  Then, moaning to himself, he\nmoves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie.  He\npicks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment,\nbarking a few philosophical remarks.  Chewie sticks the robot's head on\nits torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.\nSuddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches\ntwo connectors together.  Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his\nvoice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.\nTHREEPIO\nMmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take\nthis off!  I, uh, don't mean to\nintrude here.  I, don't, no, no,\nno... Please don't get up.  No!\nChewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry\nhead.  He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio\nimmediately begins speaking normally.\nTHREEPIO\nStormtroopers?  Here?  We're in\ndanger.  I must tell the others.\nOh, no!  I've been shot!\n\nDarth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an\nelaborate torture mechanism.  Han is strapped to a rack which tilts\nforward onto the torture device.  Vader activates the mechanism,\ncreating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face.\nThe door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a\nsharp, piercing cry of agony.  Darth Vader moves to the holding\nchamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.\n\nLANDO\nLord Vader.\nVADER\n(to Fett)\nYou may take Captain Solo to\nJabba the Hut after I have\nSkywalker.\nHan's screams filter through the torture room door.\nBOBA FETT\nHe's no good to me dead.\nVADER\nHe will not be permanently damaged.\nLANDO\nLord Vader, what about Leia and\nthe Wookiee?\nVADER\nThey must never again leave this\ncity.\nLANDO\nThat was never a condition of our\nagreement, nor was giving Han to\nthis bounty hunter!\nVADER\nPerhaps you think you're being\ntreated unfairly.\nLANDO\nNo.\nVADER\nGood.  It would be unfortunate if\nI had to leave a garrison here.\nVader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett.  Lando walks\nswiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself.\nLANDO\nThis deal's getting worse all\nthe time.\n\nChewie now has a little more of Threepio back together.  One arm is\nconnected, but the legs are yet to be attached.  There is one small\nproblem, however.  It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's\nhead on backwards.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, yes, that's very good.  I like\nthat.  Oh!  Something's not right\nbecause now I can't see.  Wait.\nWait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?\nI'm backwards, you stupid furball.\nOnly an overgrown mophead like you\nwould be stupid enough...\nThreepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a\ncircuit and the droid shuts down.  The Wookiee smells something and\nsits up.  The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is\nshoved into the room by two stormtroopers.  Barking his concern, the\nhuge Wookiee gives Han a big hug.  Han is very pale, with dark circles\nunder his eyes.\nHAN\nI feel terrible.\nChewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open\nrevealing Leia.  She, too, looks a little worse for wear.  The troopers\npush her into the cell, and the door slides closed.  She moves to Han,\nwho is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking\nhis head.\nLEIA\nWhy are they doing this?\nHAN\nThey never even asked me any\nquestions.\nThe cell door slides open.  Lando and two of his guards enter.\nLEIA\nLando.\nHAN\nGet out of here, Lando!\nLANDO\nShut up and listen!  Vader has\nagreed to turn Leia and Chewie\nover to me.\nHAN\nOver to you?\nLANDO\nThey'll have to stay here, but at\nleast they'll be safe.\nLEIA\nWhat about Han?\nLANDO\nVader's giving him to the bounty\nhunter.\nLEIA\nVader wants us all dead.\nLANDO\nHe doesn't want you at all.  He's\nafter somebody called Skywalker.\nHAN\nLuke?\nLANDO\nLord Vader has set a trap for him.\nLeia's mind is racing.\nLEIA\nAnd we're the bait.\nLANDO\nWell, he's on his way.\nHan's rage peaks.\nHAN\nPerfect.  You fixed us all pretty\ngood, didn't you?\n(spits it out)\nMy friend!\nHan hauls off and punches Lando.  The two friends are instantly engaged\nin a frantic close-quarters fight.  The guards hit Han with their rifle\nbutts and he flies across the room.  Chewie growls and starts for the\nguards.  They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando\nstops them.\nLANDO\nStop!  I've done all I can.  I'm\nsorry I couldn't do better, but\nI have my own problems.\nHAN\nYeah, you're a real hero.\nLando and the guards leave.  Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia\nand Chewie help him up.\nLEIA\n(dabs at his wound)\nYou certainly have a way with\npeople.\n\nFour armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large\nchamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks.  In the middle\nof the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform.  Darth Vader\nand Lando stand near the platform.\nVADER\nThis facility is crude, but it\nshould be adequate to freeze\nSkywalker for his journey to the\nEmperor.\nAn Imperial soldier appears.\nIMPERIAL SOLDIER\nLord Vader, ship approaching.\nX-wing class.\nVADER\nGood.  Monitor Skywalker and allow\nhim to land.\nThe soldier bows and leaves the chamber.\nLANDO\nLord Vader, we only use this\nfacility for carbon freezing.  If\nyou put him in there, it might\nkill him.\nVADER\nI do not want the Emperor's prize\ndamaged.  We will test it... on\nCaptain Solo.\nLando's face registers dismay.\n\nThere is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform.  Six\nUgnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use.  A special\ncoffinlike container is put in place.  With Boba Fett in the lead, a\nsquad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to\nChewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is\nThreepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's\nand the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see\nwhat is happening.  His one attached arm is animate and expressive,\nintermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.  The\nremaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back\nso that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.\nTHREEPIO\nIf only you had attached my legs,\nI wouldn't be in this ridiculous\nposition.  Now, remember, Chewbacca,\nyou have a responsibility to me,\nso don't do anything foolish.\nHAN\n(to Lando)\nWhat's going on... buddy?\nLANDO\nYou're being put into carbon freeze.\nBoba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.\nBOBA FETT\nWhat if he doesn't survive?  He's\nworth a lot to me.\nVADER\nThe Empire will compensate you\nif he dies.  Put him in!\nRealizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and\nattacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han.  Within seconds, other\nImperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee\nwith their laser weapons.\nFrom the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in\npanic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop,\nChewbacca, stop...!\nThe stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.\nHAN\nStop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear\nme?  Stop!\nTHREEPIO\nYes, stop, please!  I'm not ready\nto die.\nHan breaks away from his captors.  Vader nods to the guards to let him\ngo and the pirate breaks up the fight.\nHAN\nChewie!  Chewie, this won't help\nme.  Hey!\nHan gives the Wookiee a stern look.\nHAN\nSave your strength.  There'll be\nanother time.  The princess - you\nhave to take care of her.  You\nhear me?\nHan winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.\nIn a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too\ndistraught to protest.  Han turns to Princess Leia.  They look\nsorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a\nfinal, passionate kiss.\nLEIA\nI love you!\nHAN\nI know.\nTears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to\nthe hydraulic platform.  Han looks one final time at his friends - and\nthen, suddenly, the platform drops.  Chewie howls.  Leia turns away in\nagony.\nLando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.\nInstantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and\nfluid as great as any steel furnace.  Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns\naway from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.\nTHREEPIO\nWhat... what's going on?  Turn\nround, Chewbacca, I can't see.\nOh... they've encased him in\ncarbonite.  He should be quite\nwell-protected - if he survives\nthe freezing process, that is.\nChewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an\nangry glance and bark.\nA huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate\nout of the vat and stands him on the platform.  Some Ugnaughts rush\nover and push the block over onto the platform.  They slide the\ncoffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it\ninside.  They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step\naway.  Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat.  He\nshakes his head in relief.\nVADER\nWell, Calrissian, did he survive?\nLANDO\nYes, he's alive.  And in perfect\nhibernation.\nVader turns to Boba Fett.\nVADER\nHe's all yours bounty hunter.\nReset the chamber for Skywalker.\nIMPERIAL OFFICER\nSkywalker has just landed, my\nlord.\nVADER\nGood.  See to it that he finds\nhis way here.  Calrissian, take\nthe princess and the Wookiee to\nmy ship.\nLANDO\nYou said they'd be left in the\ncity under my supervision.\nVADER\nI am altering the deal.  Pray I\ndon't alter it any further.\nLando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia,\nChewie, and Threepio.\n\nAs Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a\ngroup of people coming down a side hallway.  Artoo lets out an excited\nseries of beeps and whistles.  Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops\nin his tracks with a feeble squeak.\nBoba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the\nfloating, encased body of Han Solo.  Two stormtroopers, who follow,\nimmediately spot Luke and open fire on him.  The youth draws his weapon\nand blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot.  The\ntwo guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and\nfires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a\nhuge chunk of wall.\nLuke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett,\nHan, and the guards are gone.  A think metal door blocks the passage.\nLuke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a\nsecond hallway by several other stormtroopers.  Leia turns just in time\nto see Luke.\nLEIA\nLuke!  Luke, don't - it's a\ntrap!  It's a trap!\nBefore she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears\nfrom sight.  Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing\nbehind.\n\nLuke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings.  Leia and the\nothers are nowhere to be seen.  Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the\ncorridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes\nslamming down, cutting off Luke's exit.  Several more doors clang shut,\nechoing through the chamber.\n\nArtoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door.  He\nwhistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the\nother direction.\n\nLuke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam.  Seeing an\nopening above him, he stops to look up.  As he does, the platform he\nstands on begins to move.\n\nLuke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform.  The room is\ndeathly quiet.  Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else\nseems to be in the large room.  Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.\nSteam begins to build up in the chamber.  Looking up through the steam,\nLuke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him.  Luke holsters\nhis gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader.  He feels confident,\neager to engage his enemy.\nVADER\nThe Force is with you, young\nSkywalker.  But you are not a\nJedi yet.\nLuke ignites his sword in answer.  In an instant, Vader's own sword is\nlit.  Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow.  Again Luke attacks, and\nthe swords of the two combatants clash in battle.\n\nLeia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along,\nguarded by six stormtroopers.  The group reaches an intersection where\nLobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention.\nThe guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers.\nTaking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia\nand one to Lando.\nLANDO\nWell done.  Hold them in the\nsecurity tower - and keep it\nquiet.  Move.\nAs Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to\nundo Chewie's binding.\nLEIA\nWhat do you think you're doing?\nLANDO\nWe're getting out of here.\nTHREEPIO\nI knew all along it had to be a\nmistake.\nChewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him.\nLEIA\nDo you think that after what you\ndid to Han we're going to trust\nyou?\nLando tries to free himself from Chewie.\nLANDO\n(choking)\nI had no choice...\nChewie barks ferociously.\nTHREEPIO\n(to Chewie)\nWhat are you doing?  Trust him,\ntrust him!\nLEIA\nOh, so we understand, don't we,\nChewie?  He had no choice.\nLANDO\nI'm just trying to help...\nLEIA\nWe don't need any of your help.\nLANDO\n(choking)\nH-a-a-a...\nLEIA\nWhat?\nTHREEPIO\nIt sounds like Han.\nLANDO\nThere's still a chance to save\nHan... I mean, at the East\nPlatform...\nLEIA\nChewie.\nChewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back.\nTHREEPIO\n(to Lando)\nI'm terribly sorry about all this.\nAfter all, he's only a Wookiee.\n\nThe two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of\nthe bounty hunter's ship.  Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to\nthe cargo hold.\nBOBA FETT\nPut Captain Solo in the cargo\nhold.\nAnd with that, the door slams shut.\n\nLando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly\nthey spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo!  Artoo!  Where have you\nbeen?\nChewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be\nspun out of sight of his friend.\nTHREEPIO\nTurn around, you wooly...!\n(to Artoo)\nHurry, hurry!  We're trying to\nsave Han from the bounty hunter!\nWhistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing\ngroup.\nTHREEPIO\nWell, at least your still in\none piece!  Look what happened to\nme!\n\nLuke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the\nchamber.  Their swords clash, the platform sways.  Luke aggressively\ndrives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.\nVADER\nYou have learned much, young one.\nLUKE\nYou'll find I'm full of surprises.\nVader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and\nsending it flying.  Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the\nyouth to jump back to protect himself.  Losing his balance, Luke rolls\ndown the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform.  There he\nsprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken.  Just in time he looks up\nto see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him.  Luke rolls\naway as Vader lands.  Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his\nenemy.\nVADER\nYour destiny lies with me,\nSkywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to\nbe true.\nLUKE\nNo!\nBehind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly.  All\nthe while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.\nSuddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and\nfalls back into the opening.  There is a rumble, and in an instant\nfreezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision.   Vader turns aside and\ndeactivates his sword.\nVADER\nAll to easy.  Perhaps you are not\nas strong as the Emperor thought.\nThrough the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.  Liquid metal\nbegins to pour into the pit.\nVader turns around - and then looks up.  He sees Luke, who has leaped\nfifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the\ncarbonite outlet.\nVADER\nImpressive... most impressive.\nLuke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the\nsteaming carbonite pit.  He raises his hand.  His sword, which had\nfallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his\noutstretched hand and is instantly ignited.  Vader immediately lights\nhis sword as well.\nVADER\nObi-Wan has taught you well.  You\nhave controlled your fear... now\nrelease your anger.\nLuke is more cautious, controlling his anger.  He begins to retreat as\nVader goads him on.  As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he\nhas been foolhardy.  A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back.\nAnother exchange and Vader retreats.  Luke presses forward.\nVADER\nOnly your hatred can destroy me.\nBreathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader.\nHe lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to\nfill up with steam.\nVader retreats before Luke's skillful sword.  Vader blocks the sword,\nbut looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes.  The\nenergy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of\ncollapse.  Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of\nVader.  He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers\nhimself into the pit.\n\nMoving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the\nreactor room.  He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward\na large window as Vader enters.\nLuke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.\nBehind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall\nand comes smashing forward toward his back.  Luke turns and cuts it in\nhalf just as another machine comes hurtling at him.  Using the Force,\nLuke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an\ninvisible shield.\nA large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke.  He deflects it.\nSparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth.\nSmall tools and equipment come flying at him.  Bombardment from all\nsides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is\nbloodied and bruised.  Finally, one machine glances off his and goes\nflying out the large window.  A fierce wind blows into the room,\nunmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.\nA piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.\n\nLeia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the\ndoor to the landing platform.  They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a\nmoment before the door slams shut.  The group ducks into an alcove as\nstormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor.  The troopers send a\nrain of laser bolts at the group.  Chewie returns their fire as Lando\npunches desperately at the door's control panel.\nLANDO\nThe security codes has been changed!\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, you can tell the computer\nto override the security system.\nThreepio points to a computer socket on the control panel.  Artoo beeps\nand scoots toward it.  Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's\nintercom.\nLANDO\nAttention!  This is Lando\nCalrissian.  The Empire has takes\ncontrol of the city.  I advise\neveryone to leave before more\nImperial troops arrive.\nArtoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the\nsocket.  Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream.  Artoo's\ncircuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out\nunderneath him.  Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.\nLANDO\nThis way.\nLando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor.  As he scoots\nalong with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way.\nTHREEPIO\nDon't blame me.  I'm an interpreter.\nI'm not supposed to know a power\nsocket from a computer terminal.\n\nIn a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city.\nSome carry boxes, others packages.  They run, then change direction.\nSome are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.\nOther stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back\nat them.  Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while\nThreepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.\nTHREEPIO\nWhat are you talking about?  We're\nnot interested in the hyperdrive\non the Millennium Falcon.  It's\nfixed!  Just open the door, you\nstupid lump.\nChewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor.  A triumphant beep\nfrom Artoo - and the door snaps open.\nTHREEPIO\n(to Artoo)\nI never doubted you for a second.\nWonderful!\nArtoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes\noutside.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars\naway from the city.  Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in\npursuit.\n\nThe Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.\n\nVader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the\nFalcon disappears.  The wind blows at his cape.\nHe turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing\nplatform.\nVADER\nBring my shuttle.",
  "Landing Platform": "Han and Leia stand at the open door, armed.  Behind them, Chewie, also\narmed, surveys the scene warily.\nTHREEPIO\nOh.  No one to meet us.\nLEIA\nI don't like this.\nHAN\nWell, what would you like?\nTHREEPIO\nWell, they did let us land.\nHAN\nLook, don't worry.  Everything's\ngoing to be fine.  Trust me.\n\nHAN\nSee?  My friend.\n(to Chewie)\nKeep your eyes open, okay?\nChewie growls as Han walks down the ramp.  Lando and his men head\nacross the bridge to meet the space pirate.\n\nTHREEPIO\nWell, he seems very friendly.\nLEIA\n(wary)\nYes... very friendly.\n\nThey race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers\nreaches the main door.  Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the\ndroids get on board with Chewie.  As Chewie bounds to the ship the\nThreepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.\nTHREEPIO\nOuch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend\ndown, you thoughtless... Ow!\nChewie starts up the ship.  The giant engines begin to whine as Lando\nand Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.\nLANDO\nLeia!  Go!",
  "East Landing Platform": "An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a\nlarge bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.\nJust as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset\nsky.\nIn wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no!  Chewie, they're behind\nyou!\nA laser bolt explodes near the princess.  Everyone turns to see what\nThreepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad\nof stormtroopers running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the\nelevator.\nLeia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break\nfor the elevator.  Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess\nand the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.  Lando sticks his head out\nof the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely\nnotice.  They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of\ncaptivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.\nBut after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser\nfire toward the elevator.  Once they are inside, the door slams shut\nand the stormtroopers race forward.",
  "Gantry": "Luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his\ndeactivated sword in hand.  He puts the sword on his belt and begins to\nscramble up.\n\nLuke moves along the railing and up to the control room.\nVader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet\nVader's.  Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke\nbackward toward the gantry.\nVADER\nYou are beaten.  It is useless\nto resist.  Don't let yourself\nbe destroyed as Obi-Wan did.\nLuke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so\nviciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder.  The black armor sparks\nand smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.\nLuke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at\nhim, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword.  Luke makes a quick\nmove around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry.\nVader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins\nto fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.\nLuke glances at the instrument complex floating away.  At that instant,\nVader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his\nhand and sending his sword flying.  In great pain, Luke squeezes his\nforearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its\nextreme end.  Vader\nfollows.  The wind subsides.  Luke holds on.  There is nowhere else to\ngo.\nVADER\nThere is no escape.  Don't make\nme destroy you.  You do not yet\nrealize your importance.  You\nhave only begun to discover your\npower.  Join me and I will complete\nyour training.  With our combined\nstrength, we can end this destructive\nconflict and bring order to the\ngalaxy.\nLUKE\nI'll never join you!\nVADER\nIf you only knew the power of the\ndark side.  Obi-Wan never told\nyou what happened to your father.\nLUKE\nHe told me enough!  It was you\nwho killed him.\nVADER\nNo.  I am your father.\nShocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.\nLUKE\nNo.  No.  That's not true!\nThat's impossible!\nVADER\nSearch your feelings.  You know\nit to be true.\nLUKE\nNo!  No!  No!\nVADER\nLuke.  You can destroy the Emperor.\nHe has foreseen this.  It is your\ndestiny.  Join me, and together\nwe can rule the galaxy as father\nand son.  Come with me.  It is the\nonly way.\nVader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.\nA calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision.  In the next instant\nhe steps off the gantry platform into space.  The Dark Lord looks over\nthe platform and sees Luke falling far below.  The wind begins to blow\nat Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the\nedge.  The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast,\nunable to grab onto anything to break his fall.",
  "Bottom Of Cloud City": "Unable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the\nundermost part of Cloud City.  Reaching out desperately, he manages to\ngrab onto on electronic weather vane.\nLUKE\nBen... Ben, please!\nLuke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down.\nHe hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments.  All the\nwhile, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust\npipe.\nLUKE\nBen.  Leia!\nThere is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the\nweather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.\nLUKE\nHear me!  Leia!\n\nNearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his\nbody shifts in the wind.\n\nLuke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane.  He slips\nfrom the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks\ntoward him.  The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up\nthrough the opening of the hatch.  Luke begins to slide and finally\nfalls from the vane into space.\n\nThree TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.\n\nThe Falcon races away.  It is closely followed by three TIE fighters,\nall of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship.",
  "Star Cruiser": "Luke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand.\nLeia stands near him while Threepio and Artoo look out the window.\nLUKE\n(into comlink)\nI'll meet you at the rendezvous\npoint on Tatooine.\n\nLUKE\n(into comlink)\nChewie, I'll be waiting for your\nsignal.\nChewie's wail comes over the comlink.\nLUKE\n(into comlink)\nTake care, you two.  May the\nForce be with you.\nLuke looks down at his hand.  A metalized type of bandage has been\nwrapped around his wrist.  The medical droid makes some adjustments in\na tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of Luke's fingers.\nLUKE\nOw!\nLuke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it.  His hand is\ncompletely functional.\nHe gets up and walks over to Leia.  There is a new bond between them, a\nnew understanding.  Leia is thinking about Han; Luke is thinking about\nhis uncertain and newly complicated future.  Together they stand at the\nlarge window of the medical center looking out on the Rebel Star\nCruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space.\nLuke puts his arm around Leia.

  "Road To Jabba's Palace": "A lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine\nterrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before\ncatching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along\nthe road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.\nTHREEPIO\nOf course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and\npoor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.\nArtoo whistles timidly.\nTHREEPIO\nDon't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this\nJabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.\nThe two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.",
  "Jabba's Palace": "Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly\nknocks on the iron door.\nTHREEPIO\t (instantly)\nThere doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master\nLuke.\nA small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical\narm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects\nthe two droids.\nSTRANGE VOICE\nTee chuta hhat yudd!\nTHREEPIO\nGoodness gracious me!\nThreepio points to Artoo, then to himself.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.\nThe eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the\neye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his\nconcern.\nTHREEPIO\nI don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.\nArtoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the\nmassive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The\nrobots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at\none another, afraid to enter.\nArtoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby\ncompanion. The door lowers noisily behind them.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should\nrush into all this.\nArtoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!\n\nThe door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark\npassageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN\nGUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the\ntwo lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order.\nArtoo beeps nervously.\nTHREEPIO\nJust you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my!\nOh!

  "Jabba's Throne Room": "The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES\never conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as\nthey pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts\npartially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the\nroom to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating\ncrowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a\nrepulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the\nhorrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At\nthe foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS\nCRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba\nlaughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows\npolitely.\nTHREEPIO\nGood morning.\nJABBA\nBo Shuda!\nThe robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned\nvillain.\nTHREEPIO\nThe message, Artoo, the message.\nArtoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head,\ncreating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten\nfeet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.\nLUKE\nGreetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke\nSkywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are\npowerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally\npowerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's\nlife.\n(Jabba's crowd laughs)\nWith your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which\nwill be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant\nconfrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift:\nthese two droids.\nThreepio is startled by this announcement.\nTHREEPIO\nWhat did he say?\nLUKE\t (cont)\n... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.\nTHREEPIO\nThis can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.\nLuke's hologram disappears.\nJabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nThere will be no bargain.\nTHREEPIO\nWe're doomed.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nI will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he\nis.\nJabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne.\nHanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a\ncarbonized HAN SOLO.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.\n\nThe court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous\nparty. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a\nfat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.\nJabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons\nOola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away,\nshaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.\nJABBA\nDa Eitha!\nThe lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.\nOOLA\nNa Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...\nJabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.\nJABBA\nBoscka!\nHe pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the\nfloor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a\nmuffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous\nfriends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her\nfate through a grate.\nThreepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han\nSolo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.�An\nunnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the\nroom, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two\nguards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his\ncaptive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.\nBib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into\nhis ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens\nintently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a\ngreeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).\nBOUSHH\t (in Ubese subtitled)\nI have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no! Chewbacca!\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nAt last we have the mighty Chewbacca.\nJabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to\nThreepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!\nJabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh\nlistens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices\nBOBA FETT standing near the door.\nTHREEPIO\nOh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the\nreward of twenty-five thousand.\nBOUSHH\t (in Ubese subtitled)\nI want fifty thousand. No less.\nJabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the\nraised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his\nweapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the\nthrone. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.\nTHREEPIO\nUh, oh... but what, what did I say?\n(to Boushh)\nUh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.\nThe bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio\nlooks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The\ndroid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.\nTHREEPIO\nBecause he's holding a thermal detonator.\nThe guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the\nroom. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the\nbounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba\nstares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across\nhis vast mouth and he begins to laugh.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nThis bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.\nJabba continues.\nTHREEPIO\nJabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.\nBib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his\nreaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes\ndead.\nBOUSHH\nZeebuss.\nTHREEPIO\nHe agrees!\nThe raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and\napplause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca\ngrowls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a\nskiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing\ngirls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly\nappreciative creatures.\nBoushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the\nscene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across\nthe room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling\nhis weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.\n\nSilence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien\ncelebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several\ndrunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.\nA shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of\nthe room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his\nway carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.\nHan Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his\ncoffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter\ndeactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of\nthe coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.\nBoushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the\ncontrols on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches\nand, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization\nlever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the\ncontours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches\nas Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands,\npreviously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His\nface muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.\nBoushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath\nof life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he\nbegins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.\nBOUSHH\nJust relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.\nHan touches his face with his hand and moans.\nBOUSHH\nShhh. You have hibernation sickness.\nHAN\nI can't see.\nBOUSHH\nYour eyesight will return in time.\nHAN\nWhere am I?\nBOUSHH\nJabba's palace.\nHAN\nWho are you?\nThe bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head,\nrevealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.\nLEIA\nSomeone who loves you.\nHAN\nLeia!\nLEIA\nI gotta get you out of here.\nAs Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is\npierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.\nHAN\nWhat's that? I know that laugh.\nThe curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the\nHutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his\ngross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.\nHAN\nHey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I\ngot a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.\nJabba laughs.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nIt's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but\nnow you're Bantha fodder.\nHAN\nLook...\nJABBA\t (cont Huttese subtitled)\nTake him away!\nThe guards grab Han and start to lead him away.\nHAN\nJabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here.\nDon't be a fool!\nHan is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead\nLeia away.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nBring her to me.\nJabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young\nprincess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly\nturns away in disgust.\nLEIA\nWe have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nI'm sure.\nInexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly\nblob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.\nLEIA\nUgh!\nTHREEPIO\nOhhh, I can't bear to watch.\n\nJabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him.\nSalacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now\ndressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a\nmanacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt.\nThreepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.\nTHREEPIO\nAt last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.\nBIB\nMaster.\nJabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.\nBIB\n...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nI told you not to admit him.\nLUKE\nI must be allowed to speak.\nBIB\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nHe must be allowed to speak.\nJabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nYou weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.\nLuke stares hard at Jabba.\nLUKE\nYou will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nYour mind powers will not work on me, boy.\nLUKE\nNevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either\nprofit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not\nto underestimate my powers.\nJabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about\nthe pit.\nTHREEPIO\nMaster Luke, you're standing on...\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nThere will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.\nLuke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies\ninto Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his\nhand.\nJABBA\nBascka!\nThe floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into\nthe pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba\nlaughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained\nby a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at\nhim and he shakes his head \"no.\"",
  "Dungeon Corridor": "One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank,\nshadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable\ncreatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm\nor tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps\npitifully.\nTHREEPIO\nWhat could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did?\nHe never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!\nA large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break\nfree, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.\n\nGamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When\na tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes\nagainst the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror.\nIt takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming\nthe door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the\niron door.",
  "Boiler Room": "The door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy\nmachinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are\nmet by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can\nbe seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work\ndroid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons\nare pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized\nelectronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-\n9D9.\nNINEDENINE\nAh, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?\nTHREEPIO\nI am See-Threepio, human-cy...\nNINEDENINE\nYes or no will do.\nTHREEPIO\nOh. Well, yes.\nNINEDENINE\nHow many languages do you speak?\nTHREEPIO\nI am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can\nreadily...\nNINEDENINE\nSplendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got\nangry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.\nTHREEPIO\nDisintegrated?\nNINEDENINE\t (to a Gamorrean guard)\nGuard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining\nbolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.\nThe guard shoves Threepio toward the door.\nTHREEPIO\t (disappearing)\nArtoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!\nArtoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps\nangrily.\nNINEDENINE\nYou're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have\nneed for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in\nnicely.\nThe poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured\nelectronic scream.",
  "Dungeon Cell": "The heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A\nguard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door\nslams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack\nin the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is\nheard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell\ndoor and listens.\nHAN\nChewie? Chewie, is that you?\nThe shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting\nhim off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light,\nrevealing Chewie.\nHAN\nAh! Chew--Chewie!\nThe giant Wookiee barks with glee.\nHAN\nWait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?\nChewie barks an excited blue streak.\nHAN\nLuke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less\nrescue anybody.\nChewie barks a reply.\nHAN\nA...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets\ndelusions of grandeur.\nChewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.\nHAN\nI'm all right, pal. I'm all right.",
  "Main Gate And Hall": "Noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT\nand reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a\nrobe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke\nstrides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block\nLuke's path. Luke halts.\nLuke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately\nlower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and\nmoves on down the hallway.\nBib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they\napproach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his\ndirection and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the\nconversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.\nLUKE\nI must speak with Jabba.\nBib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and\nstares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.\nLUKE\nYou will take me to Jabba now!\nBib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him\ninto the gloom.\nLUKE\nYou serve your master well.\nBib responds.\nLUKE\nAnd you will be rewarded.",
  "Rancor Pit": "Luke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the\ndungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically\nfor help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in\nthe side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic.\nLuke looks calmly around for a means of escape.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, no! The Rancor!\nAt the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged\nRANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries\nfutilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.\nThe Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the\nRancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few\nscreams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers\nand laughs at the guard's fate.\nThe monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just\nahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of\nan earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his\nsalivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the\nmonster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in\nrage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an\navalanche.\nThe monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes\ninto a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the\nholding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility\ndoor--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into\nthe crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it\ndown on the Rancor's finger.\n\nThe Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding\ncave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he\nsucceeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond\nthe gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the\nmonster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The\nguards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears,\nlaughing.\nLuke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for\nhim. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall.\nAs the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the\ncave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes\ncrashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on\nan egg.\nA startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation\nat this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning\nred with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh\ncommands to his guards and they hurry off.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nBring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.\n\nThe Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead\nbeast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly\nat Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel\nand take Luke away.",
  "Throne Room": "The crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into\nthe throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.\nLUKE\nHan!\nHAN\nLuke!\nLUKE\nAre you all right?\nHAN\nFine. Together again, huh?\nLUKE\nWouldn't miss it.\nHAN\nHow are we doing?\nLUKE\nThe same as always.\nHAN\nThat bad, huh? Where's Leia?\nLuke looks to Leia.\nLEIA\nI'm here.\nThreepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia\nlike a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from\nthe other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.\nThreepio steps forward and translates for the captives.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed\nthat you are to be terminated immediately.\nHAN\nGood, I hate long waits.\nTHREEPIO\nYou will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of\nCarkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.\nHAN\t (to Luke)\nDoesn't sound so bad.\nTHREEPIO\nIn his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as\nyou are slowly digested over a thousand years.\nHAN\nOn second thought, let's pass on that, huh?\nChewie barks his agreement.\nLUKE\nYou should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever\nmake.\nJabba cackles evilly at this.\nAs the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer\nrises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but\nLuke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.",
  "Barge Observation Deck": "Jabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His\nentire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time.\nLeia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to\nher neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to\nhim.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nSoon you will learn to appreciate me.\nThreepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller\ndroid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby\ndroid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?\nArtoo beeps a quick reply.\nTHREEPIO\nWell, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous.\nThey're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!\nArtoo whistles a singsong response.\nTHREEPIO\nHmm.  I wish I had your confidence.",
  "Sail Barge": "Jabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward\nand the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps\nup to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of\nintergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across\nloudspeakers.\nTHREEPIO\nVictims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die\nhonorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba\nthe Hutt will now listen to your pleas.\n\nThe assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips\nunnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as\nhe speaks into the comlink.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nMove him into position.\nJabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.\n\nArtoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit.\nBelow, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the\nplank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a\njaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap\nopens in Artoo's domed head.\nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled)\nPut him in.\n\nJabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the\nguards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures\nwatching the action from the window are in an uproar.\n\nLeia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and\nthrows the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous\nneck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the\nchain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath\nthe tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his\nscum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms\nthrough its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia\nstruggles to free herself of her bondage.\n\nLeia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips\nthrough the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby\nlittle droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.\nLEIA\nCome on. We gotta get out of here quick.\nArtoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and\nscreaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out\none of the golden droid's eyes.\nTHREEPIO\nNot my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!\nArtoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream,\ncrashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye\ndangling from a wire) hurry off.",
  "Skiff": "Han steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.\nHAN\nThreepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get\nno such pleasure from us. Right?\nChewie growls his agreement.\nLUKE\nJabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.\nLando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look\nof conspiracy to him.\n\nLuke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the\nbloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is\nhappening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his\nfingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him\nskyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of\nthe plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He\ncasually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has\nsent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.\nWith samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded\nhim off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The\nother guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber\nflashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.\n\nLuke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of\nthe Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.\nLUKE\nEasy, Chewie.\nAt that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts\nfrom a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of\nthe rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately\nabove the Sarlacc pit.\nLANDO\nWhoa! Whoa! Help!\n\nBoba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who\nhas freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire,\nthe young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty\nhunter's gun in half.\nImmediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck\ngun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the\nrail.\nHAN\nChewie, you okay? Where is he?\nThe Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.\nHAN\nI'm okay, pal.\nFor a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a\ncable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong\ncable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from\nthe wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight\nup to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable\nand stands free.\nAnother blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is\nknocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.\nLANDO\nHan! Chewie?\nHAN\nLando!\nLuke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets\nhim. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves\nin on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young\nJedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating\nthe guards from their midst.\nChewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han,\nguiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards.\nHan searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold\nof the spear.\nBoba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the\nother skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his\narm, and aims his lethal appendage.\nChewie barks desperately at Han.\nHAN\nBoba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?\nThe space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand\nwhacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.\nThe impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts\noff, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the\nside of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams\nas his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into\nthe mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a\nweak congratulations to Han.\n\nLuke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han\nextends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously\nfrom a rope on the prisoner's skiff.\nHAN\nLando, grab it!\nLANDO\nLower it!\nHAN\nI'm trying!\nA major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han\nand almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks,\nand Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot\ncatches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit.\nThe wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit\nfrom the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.\nHAN\nWhoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.\nChewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han\nextends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the\npit.\nHAN\nGrab it! L--Lando. Grab!\nLuke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck\ngun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the\nskiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail\nBarge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up\nthe hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his\nhead. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks\nthe helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.\nThe injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who\nis in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron\nhas stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by\nlying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand\nmoves him closer to his final reward.\nHAN\nGrab it! Almost... You almost got it!\nAnother blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let\ngo of the spear.\nLANDO\nHold it! Whoa!\nAgain Han extends the spear toward Lando.\nHAN\nGently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.\nLando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly\naround his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.\nHAN\nChewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.\nLANDO\nNo, wait! I thought you were blind!\nHAN\nIt's all right. Trust me. Don't move.\nLANDO\nAll right! A little higher! Just a little higher!\nHan adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate\nfires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and\nChewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.\nHAN\nChewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!\n\nHan leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck.\nLuke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.\nLUKE\nLet's go! And don't forget the droids.\nLANDO\nWe're on our way.\nThe Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge\ncraft is on fire.",
  "Upper Deck": "With two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket\npack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.\n\nThe deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in\ntheir gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention:\nLuke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber.\nThe deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young\nJedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more\ngunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge)\nracing for him, firing their laser pistols.\n\nLuke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by\nguards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke\nturns to face another guard.\nLUKE\t (to Leia)\nGet the gun! Point it at the deck!\nLeia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels\nthe gun around.\nLUKE\nPoint it at the deck!\nA laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain,\nbut manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the\nguards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He\nflexes the hand; it still works.\nNear the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves\nas Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.\nArtoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself,\ntumbling toward the sand.\nLuke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she\nhas brought around to point down at the deck.\nLUKE\nCome on!\nLuke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers\nLeia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun\nexplodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.",
  "Dune Sea": "Threepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next\nto it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand.

Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR\nTHE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand,\npressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed\nby Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each\nsupporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his\nwound.\nSoon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It\nis the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing\nand a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.\nHAN\nI don't know.

The assembled troops move to rigid attention\nwith a momentous SNAP.\nThen, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a\nrather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way\ndown the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak\nsimilar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's\nface is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow\neyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme\nRuler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.\nEMPEROR\t (to Vader)\nRise, my friend.\nVader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way\nalong the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay\nkneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several\nImperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the\nprocession.\nVADER\nThe Death Star will be completed on schedule.\nEMPEROR\nYou have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue\nyour search for young Skywalker.\nVADER\nYes, my Master.\nEMPEROR\nPatience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does,\nyou must bring him\nbefore me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the\ndark side of the\nForce.\nVADER\nAs you wish.\nEMPEROR\nEverything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\nHe laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial\ntroops.",
  "Yoda's House": "Once again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of\nthe swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps\ndisconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm\nyellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.\n\nThe tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of\nthe cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that\nclutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER.\nHis manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.\nYODA\nHmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?\nLuke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look\nhas been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.\nLUKE\nNo... of course not.\nYODA\t (tickled, chuckles)\nI do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.\n(Points a crooked finger)\nWhen nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?\nYoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.\nYODA\nSoon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.\nYoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.\nLUKE\nMaster Yoda, you can't die.\nYODA\nStrong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me\nand soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the\nForce.\nLUKE\nBut I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.\nYODA\nNo more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.\nYoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.\nLUKE\nThen I am a Jedi?\nYODA\t (shakes his head)\nOhhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then,\nonly then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.\nLuke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his\ncourage. Finally he is able to ask.\nLUKE\nMaster Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?\nYoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile\ncreases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.\nYODA\nMmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.\nLuke watches him, each moment an eternity.\nLUKE\nYoda, I must know.\nYODA\nYour father he is.\nLuke reacts as if cut.\nYODA\nTold you, did he?\nLUKE\nYes.\nA new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.\nYODA\nUnexpected this is, and unfortunate...\nLUKE\nUnfortunate that I know the truth?\nYoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.\nYODA\t\t (gathering all his strength)\nNo. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your\ntraining. Not\nready for the burden were you.\nLUKE\nWell, I'm sorry.\nYODA\nRemember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger,\nfear, aggression.\nThe dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever\nwill it dominate your\ndestiny.\nHe beckons the young Jedi closer to him.\nYODA\nLuke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor,\nor suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I\n(cough),\nthe last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your\nfamily. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...\n(with great effort)\nThere is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.\nHe catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green\ncreature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears\nin front of his eyes.",
  "Dagobah Swamp": "Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting,\nbut is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to\nhelp Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.\nLUKE\nI can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.\nBEN\t (OS)\nYoda will always be with you.\nLuke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.\nLUKE\nObi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?\nThe ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.\nLUKE\nYou told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.\nBEN\nYou father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be\nAnakin Skywalker\nand became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your\nfather was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a\ncertain point of view.\nLUKE\t (turning away, derisive)\nA certain point of view!\nBEN\nLuke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend\ngreatly on our own\npoint of view.\nLuke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.\nBEN\nI don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it\ncertainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened\nto your father was my fault.\nBen pauses sadly.\nBEN\nAnakin was a good friend.\nLuke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a\nstump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.\nBEN\nWhen I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was\namazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to\ntrain him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well\nas Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the\ngalaxy.\nLuke is entranced.\nLUKE\nThere's still good in him.\nBEN\nI also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be\ndone. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.\nLUKE\nI can't do it, Ben.\nBEN\nYou cannot escape your destiny.\nLUKE\nI tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.\nBEN\nVader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience\nwas part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value\nof patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you\ncould have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been\nprepared.\nLUKE\nBut I had to help my friends.\nBEN\t (grinning at Luke's indignation)\nAnd did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved\nlittle by rushing back prematurely, I fear.\nLUKE\t (with sadness)\nI found out Darth Vader was my father.\nBEN\nTo be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side\n- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest\ndoor - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what\nhe found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're\nno longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now,\nyou must face Darth Vader again!\nLUKE\nI can't kill my own father.\nBEN\nThen the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.\nLUKE\nYoda spoke of another.\nBEN\nThe other he spoke of is your twin sister.\nLUKE\nBut I have no sister.\nBEN\nHmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your\nfather when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were\nto have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the\nreason why your sister remains safely anonymous.\nLUKE\nLeia! Leia's my sister.\nBEN\nYour insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They\ndo you credit.\nBut they could be made to serve the Emperor.\nLuke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.\nBEN\t (continuing his narrative)\nWhen your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your\nmother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep\nyou both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you\nto live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia\nto live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.\nLuke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.\nBEN\t (attempting to give solace with his words)\nThe Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in\nthat system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew\nshe'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power,\nsince Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family\ncontinued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster\nfather's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of\ncourse... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the\ncorrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a\nvital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she\nwas doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had\nalways told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became\ndesperate.\nLuke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his\nsister.\nLUKE\nBut you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.\nBEN\nShe hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have,\nLuke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your\nfamily. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy\nVader!",
  "Headquarters Frigate": "Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in\nthe WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a\nholographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the\nnearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.\nMON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern\nbut beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several\nmilitary leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a\nsalmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he\nfinds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.\nHan peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.\nHAN\nWell, look at you, a general, huh?\nLANDO\nOh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the\nbattle of Taanab.\nHAN\t (sarcastic)\nWell, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I\ndidn't know they were\nlookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.\nLANDO\t (smiling)\nI'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.\nHAN\nWell, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable\none, remember?\nMon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.\nMON MOTHMA\nThe Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has\ncome.\nThis causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the\nDeath Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the\ncenter of the room.\nMON MOTHMA\nThe data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location\nof the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon\nsystems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial\nFleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is\nrelatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that\nthe Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the\nconstruction of this Death Star.\nA volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia\nas Chewie barks his amazement.\nMON MOTHMA\t (cont)\nMany Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.\nAdmiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field\nand the Moon of Endor.\nACKBAR\nYou can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor.\nAlthough the weapon\nsystems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does\nhave a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield,\nwhich is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield\nmust be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield\nis down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly\ninto the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.\nThere's a concerned murmur.\nACKBAR\t (cont)\nGeneral Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack\nHan turns to Lando with a look of respect.\nHAN\nGood luck.\nLando nods his thanks.\nHAN\nYou're gonna need it.\nACKBAR\nGeneral Madine.\nMadine moves center stage.\nGENERAL MADINE\nWe have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and\nusing a secret\nImperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the\nshield generator.\nThe assembly begins to mumble among themselves.\nTHREEPIO\nSounds dangerous.\nLEIA\t (to Han)\nI wonder who they found to pull that off.\nGENERAL MADINE\nGeneral Solo, is your strike team assembled?\nLeia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.\nHAN\nUh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.\nChewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him.\nHAN\nWell, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.\nChewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.\nHAN\t (smiles)\nThat's one.\nLEIA\nUh, General... count me in.\nVOICE\t (OS)\nI'm with you, too!\nThey turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more\ncheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and\nLeia are surprised and delighted.\nLeia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him\nand looks into his eyes questioningly.\nLEIA\nWhat is it?\nLUKE\t (hesitant)\nAsk me again sometime.\nHan, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up.\nHAN\nLuke.\nLUKE\nHi, Han... Chewie.\nArtoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.\nTHREEPIO\n\"Exciting\" is hardly the word I would use.\n\nThe Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which\nlooks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay.\nChewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up\nthe shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and\nsupplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-\nbyes and start up the ramp.\nHAN\nLook. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the\nhelp you can get. She's\nthe fastest ship in the fleet.\nLANDO\nAll right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take\ngood care of her.\nShe-she won't get a scratch.

Not a scratch.\nLANDO\nLook, would you get going, you pirate.\nHan and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.\nLANDO\nGood luck.\nHAN\nYou, too.\nHan goes up the ramp.

  "Emperor's Throne Room": "The converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at\nthe far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair\nbefore a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death\nStar to the giant green moon of Endor.\nDarth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council,\ncautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After\nseveral tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.\nVADER\nWhat is thy bidding, my Master?\nEMPEROR\nSend the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until\ncalled for.\nVADER\nWhat of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?\nEMPEROR\nIt is of no concern.

  "Forest Landing Site": "The stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark,\nprimeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.\nOn an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a\nsteep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The\ntroops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio\nbringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.\nUp ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly\nto the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke\ncrawl up to take a look.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, I told you it was dangerous here.\nTHEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering\nthrough bushes in the valley below.

  "Forest Clearing": "The four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far\nfrom the two Imperial scouts.\nHAN\nChewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.\nLUKE\nQuietly, there might be more of them out there.\nHAN\t (grins)\nHey... it's me.\nHan and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts.\nLuke and Leia exchange smiles.\nHan sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout\nwhirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.\nSCOUT #1\nGo for help! Go!\nThe second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie\ngets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to\ncrash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.\nLUKE\t (sarcastic)\nGreat. Come on.\nLuke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol\ndrawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where\ntwo more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied\nbike parked nearby.\nLEIA\nOver there! Two more of them!\nLUKE\nI see them. Wait, Leia!\nBut Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She\nstarts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.\nLUKE\t (pointing to the controls)\nQuick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!\nLuke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely\navoiding two huge trees.\nHAN\nHey, wait! Ahhh!\nHe flips the remaining scout to the ground.\n\nA strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into\nview. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat\npuzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this\nfrightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up\nand stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where\nshe is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and\ndisheveled.\nThe Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a\ndefensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins\npoking her with the sharp point of the spear.\nLEIA\nCut it out!\nShe stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.\nLEIA\nI'm not gonna hurt you.\nLeia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of\nher speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.\nLEIA\nWell, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here\nis.\nShe puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from\nher fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log\nbeside her.\nLEIA\nWell, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.\nWicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia\npats the log again.\nLEIA\nI promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.\nMore growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.\nLEIA\nAll right. You want something to eat?\nShe takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him.\nWicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously\ntoward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.\nLEIA\nThat's right. Come on. Hmmm?\nSniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the\nlog beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps\nback, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her\nand chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.\nLEIA\nLook, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery\nlittle thing, aren't you?\nReassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming\nto investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to\nsniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning\nto Leia.\nLEIA\nWhat is it?\nSuddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log\nnext to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding\nbehind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears\nunderneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the\nforest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL\nSCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches\nout his hand for her weapon.\nSCOUT #l\nFreeze!  Come on, get up!\nShe hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage\nin front of the log.\nSCOUT #1\nGo get your ride and take her back to base.\nSCOUT #2\nYes, sir.\nThe second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the\nlog, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout\njumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled.\nLeia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol,\nand the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and\nhits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's\nbike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once\nmore. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards\nLeia with�new respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking\naround all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the\ndense foliage.\nLEIA\nCome on, let's get outta here.\nAs they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and\ntugs at Leia to follow him.\n\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move\nthrough the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia.\nLuke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.\nHAN\t (OS)\nLuke! Luke!\nLuke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage\nof a speeder bike in the grass.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Master Luke.\nLUKE\nThere's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.\nHe tosses the helmet to Han.\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.\nHAN\t (gravely)\nI hope she's alright.\nChewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off\nthrough the foliage.\nHAN\nWhat, Chewie? What? Chewie!\nThe others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along,\nArtoo whistles nervously.",
  "Forest": "The two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia\npursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from\ntheir bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.\nLUKE\nMove closer!\nLeia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer\nthrough a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree,\nslowing the scout.\nLUKE\nGet alongside that one!\nLeia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their\nsteering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of\nthe scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him\noff the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike\nand follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the\nremaining scout.\nLUKE\nGet him!\nThe speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing\ninto pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser\ncannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a\nglancing hit.\nLUKE\t (indicating the one ahead)\nKeep on that one! I'll take these two!\nWith Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into\nthe braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as\nthey zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and\nstarts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a\nmanner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted\nout of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.\nThe scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into\nturbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.\nFAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom\nthrough the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and\nrises out of sight.\nThe scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia\ndives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes\na glancing hit.\nLeia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches\ndown, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has\nblasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike\nexplodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion.\nBut when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a\ngiant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a\nconflagration.\nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue\ntheir weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The\nscout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a\nbridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top\nand crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a\nwide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside\nhim makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all\nhis might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able\nto make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the\nscout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are\nmoving as one.\nAnother big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and\ndives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's\nexplodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find\nLuke.\nLuke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and\nopens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and\nbegins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it\nappears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant,\nLuke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty\nslash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling,\nit rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.\n\nThe group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a\ntall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from\nit.\nHAN\nHey, I don't get it.\nThe rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.\nHAN\t (cont)\nNah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.\nChewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.\nLUKE\nChewie, wa-wait!  Don't!\nToo late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake.\nSPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net,\nsuspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of\nbeeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a\njumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.\nHAN\nNice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.\nLUKE\nWill you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this\nthing.\n(trying to free an arm)\nHan, can you reach my lightsaber?\nHAN\nYeah, sure.\nArtoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting\nappendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an\narm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to\nspin.\nTHREEPIO\nArtoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-\nop!!\nArtoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net,\ncrashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they\nrealize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long\nspear.\nHAN\nWha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.\nHan pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok\nwarrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face.\nHe grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.\nHAN\nHey!\nLUKE\nHan, don't. It'll be all right.\nThe Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets\nthem take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.\nLUKE\nChewie, give 'em your crossbow.\nArtoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free\nof the net and sits up, rattled.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, my head. Oh, my goodness!\nWhen the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among\nthemselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok\nnearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In\na moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled\nbark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks\nbegin to chant at Threepio.\nLUKE\nDo you understand anything they're saying?\nTHREEPIO\nOh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million\nforms of\ncommunication.\nHAN\nWhat are you telling them?\nTHREEPIO\nHello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive\ndialect.  But\nI do believe they think I am some sort of god.\nChewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange\n\"what next?\" looks.\nHAN\nWell, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?\nTHREEPIO\nI beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.\nHAN\nProper?!\nTHREEPIO\nIt's against my programming to impersonate a deity.\nHan moves toward Threepio threateningly.\nHAN\nWhy, you--\nSeveral Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their\ngod. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a\nmenacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands\nplacatingly.\nHAN\nMy mistake. He's an old friend of mine.\n\nA procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their\nprisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and\nwrapped in vines, cocoonlike.\nEach pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the\ncaptives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the\nremaining creatures.\n\nAn Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands\ngracefully on the huge platform.\nNow, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of\nthe forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks\nparticularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.\n\nPaploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary,\nbut he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him\nand begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds\na tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the\ntrees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the\nstill-flying, unoccupied bike.\n\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of the\nbunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted before, is now\ncrowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Imperial\ntroops. The situation looks hopeless.\nSTORMTROOPER\nAll right, move it! I said move it! Go on!\nFrom the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps\nand whistles.\nAnd --\nTHREEPIO\nHello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?\nBUNKER COMMANDER\nBring those two down here!\nSTORMTROOPER\nLet's go!\nArtoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six\nImperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids\nduck out of sight behind the tree.\nTHREEPIO\nWell, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?\nSTORMTROOPER\nFreeze! Don't move!\nTHREEPIO\nWe surrender.\nThe stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting\nquietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a\nband of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.\nTHREEPIO\nOhhh! Stand back, Artoo.\nIn a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK\nATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their\nfuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and\ntheir awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting\nEwoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the\ntrees above.\nIn the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for\nthe cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes\nto the bunker door control panel.\nLEIA\nThe code's changed. We need Artoo!\nHAN\nHere's the terminal.\nLEIA\t (into comlink)\nArtoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.\nArtoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround\nthem. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of\nwhistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked,\nruns after him.\nTHREEPIO\nGoing? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo?\nNo, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!\nBiker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the\nlittle Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.\nA group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They\nfire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns\nand heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks\nabandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker\nmoves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge\nlogs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.\nA line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's\nfoot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged\nbehind.\nTwo speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts\nround a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between\ntwo trees.\n\nArtoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide cover\nfire.\nTHREEPIO\nWe're coming!\nHAN\nCome on! Come on!\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Artoo, hurry!\nThe little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A\nlarge explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally\nlanding on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and\nsmoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn\naround to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his\nappendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in\nhis body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded\ncompanion.\nTHREEPIO\nMy goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?\nHAN\nWell, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.\nLEIA\nI'll cover you.\nEwoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the\nstormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the\nwing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting\nlaser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are\nstruck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then\nrealizes that he is dead.\n\nThe battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated\nweapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the\nImperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.\nA walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An\nEwok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The\nlogs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until\nit finally topples over with a great crash.\nA scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end\nof the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-\ntightening circles until it runs out of rope and\ncrashes into the trees with a huge explosion.\nChewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks\ncling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine,\nthen hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.\nWALKER PILOT #1\nLook!\nPILOT #2\nGet him off of there!\nThe walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked\nout and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into\nthe cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are\nthrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside,\nChewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch\nwith a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to\nlisten to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.\nChewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at\nunsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The\nEwoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the\nbattle in their favor.\n\nHan works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to\nhotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some\nstormtroopers.\nHAN\nI think I got it. I got it!\nThe three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a\nsecond blast door crashes down in front of the first.\nHan frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with\nstormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her\nshoulder hit by a laser blast.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, Princess Leia, are you all right?\nHAN\nLet's see.\nLEIA\nIt's not bad.\nSTORMTROOPER\t (OS)\nFreeze!\nThey freeze.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, dear.\nSTORMTROOPER\nDon't move!\nLeia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two\nstormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment\nseems suspended in time.\nHAN\nI love you.\nAnother shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.\nLEIA\nI know.\nSTORMTROOPER\nHands up! Stand up!\nHan stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She\ndisposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward\nLeia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him,\nits deadly weapons aimed right at him.\nHAN\t (to Leia)\nStay back.\nThe hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and\nbarks triumphantly.\nHAN\nChewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.\n\nAs the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out,\nthey're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their\nweapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the\nroof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns\nas Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.\n\nHan and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across\nthe clearing.\nHAN\nMove! Move!\nA shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a\nspectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes\nalong with the bunker.",
  "Scout Campsite": "Han, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait\nanxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed\nhead and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!\nHan, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.\nLuke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's\ntoo tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.\nHAN\nLuke! Where's Leia?\nLUKE\t (concerned)\nWhat? She didn't come back?\nHAN\nI thought she was with you.\nLUKE\nWe got separated.\nLuke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.\nLUKE\nHey, we better go look for her.\nHan nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.\nHAN\nTake the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.\nLUKE\nCome on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.\nLuke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the\nsquad proceeds in another.\nTHREEPIO\nDon't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.\nThey move off into the woods.\nTHREEPIO\t (to Artoo)\nAnd you said it was pretty here. Ugh!",
  "Emperor's Tower": "Two red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens\nto reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It\nappears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He\nwaits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark\nLord.\nEMPEROR\nI told you to remain on the command ship.\nVADER\nA small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.\nEMPEROR\t (no surprise)\nYes, I know.\nVADER\t (after a beat)\nMy son is with them.\nEMPEROR\t (very cool)\nAre you sure?\nVADER\nI have felt him, my Master.\nEMPEROR\nStrange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are\nclear, Lord\nVader.\nVader knows what is being asked.\nVADER\nThey are clear, my Master.\nEMPEROR\nThen you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.\nVADER\t (skeptical)\nHe will come to me?\nEMPEROR\nI have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will\ncome to you and\nthen you will bring him before me.\nVADER\t (bows)\nAs you wish.\nThe Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.\n\nThe Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle\nfireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel ship\nexplodes against the protective shield.\nEMPEROR\nAs you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now\nwitness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle\nstation.\n(into comlink)\nFire at will, Commander.\nLuke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the\nRebel fleet beyond.\n\nOut of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being\ndecimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there\nis no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.\nEMPEROR\nYour fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not\nsurvive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will\ndie...as will your friends.\nLuke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.\nEMPEROR\nGood. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon!\nStrike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark\nside will be complete.\nLuke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He\nignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber\nflashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the\nEmperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his\nfather.\n\nLuke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even\nmore vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown\nstronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is\nforced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke\nstands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.\nEMPEROR (laughing)\nGood.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through\nyou.\nLuke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and\nrealizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his\nlightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.\nVADER\nObi-Wan has taught you well.\nLUKE\nI will not fight you, father.\nVader walks back up the stairs to Luke.\nVADER\nYou are unwise to lower your defenses.\nVader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in\nan amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader\nstands below him.\nLUKE\nYour thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the\nconflict.\nVADER\nThere is no conflict.\nLUKE\nYou couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe\nyou'll destroy me\nnow.\nVADER\nYou underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight,\nthen you will meet\nyour destiny.\nVader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding\nthe catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground\nin a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's\nplatform. Vader moves to find him.\nEMPEROR\t (laughs)\nGood.  Good.\n\nVader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne,\nsearching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.\nVADER\nYou cannot hide forever, Luke.\nLUKE\nI will not fight you.\nVADER\nGive yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your\nfriends. Yes, your\nthoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially\nfor...\nVader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in\nanguish.\nVADER\nSister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed\nher, too. Obi-Wan\nwas wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will\nnot turn to the dark\nside, then perhaps she will.\nLUKE\nNever-r-r!\nLuke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather\nwith a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader\nfight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of\nthe low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft.\nEach stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.\nThe Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to\nblock another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the\nwrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical\nstump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the\nedge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves\nover Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat.\nThe Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.\nEMPEROR\nGood! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and\ntake your father's\nplace at my side!\nLuke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical,\nblack-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his\nfather. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in\npreparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.\nLUKE\nNever! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness.\nI am a Jedi,\nlike my father before me.\nThe Emperor's glee turns to rage.\nEMPEROR\nSo be it...Jedi.\n\nLuke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The\nEmperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.\nEMPEROR\nIf you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.\nBlinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's\nhands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the\nForce to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a\nmoment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the\nyoung Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader\nstruggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.\nEMPEROR\nYoung fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.\nLuke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the\nEmperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into\nthe bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.\nEMPEROR\nYour feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You\nhave paid the price for\nyour lack of vision.\nLuke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward\nwhere Vader stands watching.\nLUKE\t (groans)\nFather, please. Help me.\nAgain Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor,\nthen back to Luke on the floor.\nEMPEROR\nNow, young Skywalker...you will die.\nAlthough it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts\nfrom the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound\nscreaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.\nVader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed\nfigure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm.\nThe Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now\nlifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to\nstrike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his\nhelmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high\nover his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of\nthe throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength,\nDarth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.\nThe Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls\ninto the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it\nexplodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is\nwhipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the\nbottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away\nfrom the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant\nwarrior are too weak to move.",
  "Ewok Village": "The procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the\ngiant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into\nnothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts\nand rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes\nhold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other\nEwoks follow suit.\n\nThe walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and\nflicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft\nnight air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands\nstaring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.\nLEIA\nLuke, what's wrong?\nLuke turns and looks at her a long moment.\nLUKE\nLeia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?\nLEIA\nJust a little bit. She died when I was very young.\nLUKE\nWhat do you remember?\nLEIA\nJust...images, really. Feelings.\nLUKE\nTell me.\nLEIA\n(a little surprised at his insistence)\nShe was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.\n(looks up)\nWhy are you asking me all this?\nHe looks away.\nLUKE\nI have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.\nLEIA\nLuke, tell me. What's troubling you?\nLUKE\nVader is here...now, on this moon.\nLEIA\t (alarmed)\nHow do you know?\nLUKE\nI felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near.\nThat's why I have to go.\n(facing her)\nAs long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.\n(beat)\nI have to face him.\nLeia is distraught, confused.\nLEIA\nWhy?\nLuke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.\nLUKE\nHe's my father.\nLEIA\nYour father?\nLUKE\nThere's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I\ndon't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.\nLeia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.\nLEIA\nLuke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and\ncould never have.\nLUKE\nYou're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to\nuse it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has\nit...I have it...and...my sister has it.\nLeia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she\ndoesn't draw away. She begins to understand.\nLUKE\nYes. It's you Leia.\nLEIA\nI know. Somehow...I've always known.\nLUKE\nThen you know why I have to face him.\nLEIA\nNo! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave\nthis place. I wish I could go with you.\nLUKE\nNo, you don't. You've always been strong.\nLEIA\nBut, why must you confront him?\nLUKE\nBecause...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to\nthe Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I\nhave to try.\nThey hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.\nLeia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He\ndisappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed\nin moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and\ncomes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only\nnow that she is crying.\nHAN\nHey, what's goin' on?\nLeia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.\nLEIA\nNothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.\nHAN\t (angry)\nNothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?\nShe looks up at him, struggling to control herself.\nLEIA\nI...I can't tell you.\nHAN\t (loses his temper)\nDid you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?\nLEIA\nI...\nHAN\nAhhh...\nHe starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.\nHAN\nI'm sorry.\nLEIA\nHold me.\nHan gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.",
  "Ewok Village Square": "The procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks\ngather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the\nnewcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.\nHan, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is\nplaced on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others\nare leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently\nplaced near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and\nChewie are less than fascinated.\nHAN\nI have a really bad feeling about this.\nChewie growls his concern.\nSuddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes\nout of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join\nThreepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A\nlarger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber\nwith great curiosity.\nLogray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing\nto the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit\nunder Han with firewood.\nHAN\nWhat did he say?\nTHREEPIO\nI'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the\nmain course at a\nbanquet in my honor.\nThe drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut.\nLeia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening\nat the same moment the prisoners see her.\nHAN and LUKE\nLeia!\nAs she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.\nLEIA\nOh!\nTHREEPIO\nYour Royal Highness.\nArtoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the\nassembled Ewoks and sighs.\nLEIA\nBut these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.\nThreepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads\nnegatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks\nsome orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue\nwith vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han .\nHAN\nSomehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.\nLUKE\nThreepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry\nand use your magic.\nTHREEPIO\nBut Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --\nLUKE\nJust tell them.\nThreepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps\nforward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to\nconcentrate.\nTHREEPIO\nYou see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...\nNow the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the\nground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.\nTHREEPIO\n... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear!\nOh!\nThe Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio\nbegins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio\ncalling out in total panic at his situation.\nTHREEPIO\nPut me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help!\nMaster Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!\nChief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and\nrelease the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group\nembrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at\nhim, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground.\nLogray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground.\nWhen the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo\nbeeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him,\nfinally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The\nEwok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group\nof Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and\nmarveling at his height.\nTHREEPIO\nOh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.\nLUKE\nThanks, Threepio.\nTHREEPIO\t (still shaken)\nI...I never knew I had it in me.\n\nA huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels and\nEwoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing,\ndancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and\nliberation.\nLando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie. Then,\nfinally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him.\nThey stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's\ntouch, together to the end.\nRebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original\ngroup of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke seems\ndistracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.\nHe looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at\nthe edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker.\nFADE OUT\nEND CREDITS OVER STAR FIELD",
  "Chief's Hut": "A glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room,\ncreating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a\ngroup of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne.\nThe Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the\ntwo groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.\nThreepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's\nsqueaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally\nmurmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the\nRebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War,\nmimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers.\nThroughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable\nin English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-\nWan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.\nTHREEPIO\nYes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.\nThreepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han\nSolo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.\nAt the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in\nagreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.\nThe drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer\nand screeches.\nHAN\nWhat's going on?\nLEIA\nI don't know.\nLuke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something\npasses like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not\nnotice.\nTHREEPIO\nWonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.\nSeveral of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.\nHAN\nJust what I always wanted.\nChewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket\nclings to Han's leg.\nHAN\t (chuckles)\nWell, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.\n(to Wicket)\nThank you. Okay.\nTHREEPIO\nHe says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield\ngenerator.\nChewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders\noutside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.\nHAN\nGood. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try\nand get our weapons back.\nHan pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.\nHAN\t (cont)\nAnd hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.",
  "Imperial Landing Platform": "Darth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into\nan elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward\nanother ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke,\nin binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with\ncomplete calm.\nCOMMANDER\nThis is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I\nbelieve there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct\na further search of the area.\nThe commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.\nCOMMANDER\nHe was armed only with this.\nVader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the\nlightsaber from the commander's hand.\nVADER\nGood work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his\ncompanions to me.\nCOMMANDER\nYes, my Lord.\nThe officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone\nin the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest\nfilter in upon them.\nVADER\nThe Emperor has been expecting you.\nLUKE\nI know, father.\nVADER\nSo, you have accepted the truth.\nLURE\nI've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.\nVADER\t (turning to face him)\nThat name no longer has any meaning for me.\nLUKE\nIt is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there\nis good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is\nwhy you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your\nEmperor now.\nVader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved\nhand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.\nVADER\t (indicating lightsaber)\nI see you have constructed a new lightsaber.\nVader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming,\nbrilliant blade.\nVADER\nYour skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has\nforeseen.\nThey stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.\nLUKE\nCome with me.\nVADER\nObi-Wan once thought as you do.\nLuke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.\nVADER\nYou don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.\nLUKE\nI will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.\nVADER\nIf that is your destiny.\nLUKE\nSearch your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict\nwithin you. Let go\nof your hate.\nVADER\nIt is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature\nof the Force. He is\nyour master now.\nVader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring\nat one another for a long moment.\nLUKE\nThen my father is truly dead.",
  "Endor": "Han, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout,\nPAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield\ngenerator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing\nplatform. Leia studies the installation.\nLEIA\nThe main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that\nlanding platform. This\nisn't gonna be easy.\nHAN\nHey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily\nguarded than this.\nWicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to\nThreepio.\nLEIA\nWhat's he saying?\nTHREEPIO\nHe says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.\n\nHan, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and\nPaploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is\nspread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that\nleads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes\nparked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an\nobservation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.\nHAN\nBack door, huh? Good idea.\nWicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.\nHAN\t (cont)\nIt's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.\nLEIA\nWell, it only takes one to sound the alarm.\nHAN\t (with self-confident grin)\nThen we'll do it real quiet-like.\nThreepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks\nchatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers\ninto the underbrush.\nThreepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.\nTHREEPIO\nOh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!\nLEIA\nQuiet.\nTHREEPIO\nI'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.\nLEIA\nOh, no.",
  "Bunker": "Paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial\nscouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto\none of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at\nrandom. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR.\nPaploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in\nsurprise.\n\nThe Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into\nmotion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest.\nSCOUT\nLook! Over there! Stop him!\nThree of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away\nin pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.\n\nHan sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the\nshoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms\nof the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps\nout a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out\nof sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No\nsign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout\nbehind.\n\nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and\nenter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.\nHAN\nAll right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.\nThe Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels.\nLeia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.\nLEIA\nHan! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.\nHAN\nCharges!  Come on, come on!\nOutside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more\ncontrollers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at\nthe door.\nTHREEPIO\t (to Wicket)\nOh, my! They'll be captured!\nWicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into\nthe forest.\nTHREEPIO\nWa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.\nInside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial\ncommander enters.\nCOMMANDER\nFreeze! You Rebel scum.\nHan and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them\nand their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them.\nEven more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent.\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks. They're helpless.\n\nControllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an\nImperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and\ninterference.\nHAN/PILOT\t (VO)\nIt's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into\nthe woods. We\nneed reinforcements to continue the pursuit.\nThe controllers cheer.\nCONTROL ROOM COMMANDER\nSend three squads to help. Open the back door.\nSECOND COMMANDER\nYes, sir.\n\nHan, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant\nexplosive charges on the control panels and rush out.\nHAN\nThrow me another charge.",
  "Ridge": "Han, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.\nHAN \t(sighs)\nThere goes our surprise attack.\n\nHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.\nHAN\nNot bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here.\nWe'll take care of this.\nHan and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker.\nThreepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.\nTHREEPIO\nI have decided that we shall stay here.",
  "Rebel Star Cruiser": "From the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar\nwatches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.\nACKBAR\nMay the Force be with us.\n\nAlarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes\ncourse abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the\narmada tries to halt its forward momentum.\nACKBAR\nTake evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.\nA Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to\nAckbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the controller.\nCONTROLLER\nAdmiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.\nOn the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive\nImperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.\nACKBAR\nIt's a trap!\nLANDO\t (over comlink)\nFighters coming in.\nThere is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.\nThe Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head into an\narmada of TIE fighters.

Draw their fire away from the cruisers.\nWEDGE\nCopy, Gold Leader.\nThe battle continues around the giant cruisers.\n\nAckbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the\ncomlink.\nACKBAR\nWe saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.\nLANDO\nYou won't get another chance at this, Admiral.\nACKBAR\nWe have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel\nfirepower of that magnitude.\nLANDO\nHan will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.\n\nAckbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.\nACKBAR\nThe shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.\nLANDO\nWe're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.\n(laughs)\nTold you they'd do it!\nThe Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward\nthe unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.\n\nACKBAR\nWe've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on\nthat Super Star Destroyer.\nX-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.\n\nThere is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides.\nThey cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.\n\nAckbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge,\nwatching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main briefing\nroom.\nACKBAR\nMove the fleet away from the Death Star.",
  "Super Star Destroyer": "Admiral Piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge\nwindow of the Super Star Destroyer bridge.\nCOMMANDER\nWe're in attack position now, sir.\nPIETT\nHold here.\nCOMMANDER\nWe're not going to attack?\nPIETT\nI have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special\nplanned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.",
  "Ext/Int": "Rebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star\nto the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of\nthe giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters.\nWEDGE\nI'm going in.\nLANDO\nHere goes nothing.\nThree X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed\nby the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who\ncontinually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the pilot's faces as\nthey race through the dark shaft.\nLANDO\nNow lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power\ngenerator.\nWEDGE\nForm up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.\nThe fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by\nthe TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from behind and explodes.\nLANDO\nSplit up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of\nthose TIE fighters to\nfollow you.\nPILOT\nCopy, Gold Leader.\nThe Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while Lando and\nWedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and the Falcon\nscrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters continue to blast\naway at them.\nLANDO\nThat was too close.\nNien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages\non. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer.",
  "Endor Forest": "Han and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks all\nlook to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final flash of\nself-destruction. They all cheer.\nTHREEPIO\nThey did it!\nHan looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his face.\nLeia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent\nvoice.\nHAN\nI'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.\nLEIA\nHe wasn't. I can feel it.\nHAN\nYou love him, don't you?\nLeia smiles, puzzled.\nLEIA\nYes.\nHAN\nAll right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the\nway.\nShe realizes his misunderstanding.\nLEIA\nOh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother.\nHan is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.\n\nLuke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his\nfather's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet.
