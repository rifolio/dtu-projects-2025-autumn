'''U2''' are<!-- ("They are") Please note that for collective nouns (like bands), British English uses the plural "are" instead of the American singular "is". See WP:ENGVAR. --> an Irish [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Dublin]] in 1976.<!-- Please do not remove without discussing on the talk page first --> The group comprises [[Bono]] (lead vocals), [[the Edge]] (lead guitar, keyboards, and vocals), [[Adam Clayton]] (bass guitar), and [[Larry Mullen Jr.]] (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in [[post-punk]], U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, [[Effects unit|effects]]-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several elaborate tours over their career.

The band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with [[Island Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'' (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, ''[[War (U2 album)|War]]'' (1983), and singles "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]" and "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. Their fourth album, ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'' (1984), was their first collaboration with producers [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]], whose influence resulted in a more abstract, [[ambient music|ambient]] sound for the band. By the mid-1980s, U2 had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. Their fifth album, ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. One of the world's [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] with 25 million copies sold, it yielded the group's only number-one singles in the US: "[[With or Without You]]" and "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]".

Facing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary and double album ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' (1991), and the multimedia spectacle of the [[Zoo TV Tour]], the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[electronic dance music]], and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued on ''[[Zooropa]]'' (1993) and concluded after ''[[Pop (U2 album)|Pop]]'' (1997) and the [[PopMart Tour]], which polarized audiences and critics. The group re-established a more conventional, mainstream sound on ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]'' (2000) and ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'' (2004), which were critical and commercial successes. Sales of subsequent albums declined, but the group remained a popular live act. The [[U2 360° Tour]] of 2009–2011 held records for the [[List of most-attended concert tours|most-attended]] and [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tour]] until 2019. ''[[Songs of Innocence (U2 album)|Songs of Innocence]]'' (2014), the first of two companion albums in the 2010s, was criticised for its pervasive release through the [[iTunes Store]]. In 2023, U2 released ''[[Songs of Surrender]]'', an album of re-recorded songs, and began the [[U2:UV Achtung Baby Live at Sphere|U2:UV ''Achtung Baby'' Live]] concert residency to inaugurate [[Sphere (venue)|Sphere]] in the Las Vegas Valley.

=== Formation and early years (1976–1980) ===
[[File:MountTempleClock.jpg|thumb|The band formed in 1976 while attending [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] (pictured in 2007) in Dublin.]]
In 1976, [[Larry Mullen Jr.]], then a 14-year-old pupil of [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] in Dublin, Ireland, posted a note on the school's notice board in search of musicians for a new band.<!--as an Irish topic, this article uses international dating, i.e., dd/mm/yyyy not American dating mm/dd/yyyy.--> For the first practice, which was held on 25&nbsp;September in Mullen's kitchen, Mullen played drums and was joined by at least five other people: [[Bono|Paul Hewson ("Bono Vox")]] on lead vocals; [[The Edge|David Evans ("the Edge")]] and his older brother [[Dik Evans]] on guitar; [[Adam Clayton]], a friend of the Evans brothers, on bass guitar; and Ivan McCormick. Mullen later described it as "'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge." Peter Martin, a friend of Mullen and McCormick, loaned his guitar and amplifier for the first practice,<ref name="mccorm27">McCormick (2006), pp. 27, 29–30</ref> but he could not play and was quickly phased out;<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hotpress.com/news/THE-UNBELIEVABLE-BOOK/1488562.html|title=The Unbelievable Book|magazine=[[Hot Press]]|first=Neil|last=McCormick|date=3 December 1987|issue=11|volume=23|access-date=16 December 2016|archive-date=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182616/http://www.hotpress.com/news/THE-UNBELIEVABLE-BOOK/1488562.html|url-status=live}}</ref> sources differ on whether he was in attendance at the first meeting or not.<ref>Sources stating that Martin attended the first practice: {{bulleted list|Chatterton (2001), p. 130|Jobling (2014), p. 16|McGee (2008), p. 9}}

In April 1977, Feedback played their first gig for a paying audience at [[St. Fintan's High School]]. Shortly thereafter, the band changed their name to "The Hype".<ref>McGee (2008), pp. 11–12</ref> Dik Evans, who was older and by that time attending college, was becoming the odd man out of the group.

The band chose U2 for its open-ended interpretations, visual strength on posters, and because it was the name that they disliked the least.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 44</ref> Dik Evans officially left the band with a farewell concert at the Presbyterian Hall in [[Sutton, Dublin|Sutton]] on 4 March. During the show, which featured the group playing cover songs as the Hype, Dik ceremonially walked offstage.

With their record deal with Island Records coming to an end, U2 signed a more lucrative extension in 1984.

Stung by the criticism of ''Rattle and Hum'', the band sought to transform themselves musically.<ref>Flanagan (1995), pp. 4–6</ref> Seeking inspiration from [[German reunification]], they began work on their seventh studio album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', at Berlin's [[Hansa Studios]] in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno.<ref>Flanagan (1995), p. 7</ref> The sessions were fraught, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. Clayton and Mullen preferred a sound similar to U2's previous work; Bono and the Edge were inspired by European [[industrial music]] and [[electronic dance music]] and advocated a change. Weeks of tension and slow progress nearly prompted the group to break up until they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song "[[One (U2 song)|One]]".<ref>Flanagan (1995), pp. 6–11</ref> They returned to Dublin in 1991, where morale improved and the majority of the album was completed.

''Achtung Baby'' was released in November 1991.

Like ''Achtung Baby'', the 1992–1993 [[Zoo TV Tour]] was a break with the band's past. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event.

U2 developed a melodic sound under the early influence of record producer [[Steve Lillywhite]] at a time when they were not known for musical proficiency.<ref name="u2dropsbomb"/> Their songs began as minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on ''Boy'' and ''October'', before evolving with ''War'' to include aspects of rock anthem, [[funk]], and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Review: War|magazine=Rolling Stone|first=J.D.|last=Considine|date=20 January 1983| issue=387}}</ref> ''Boy'' and ''War'' were labelled "muscular and assertive" by ''Rolling Stone'',<ref name="RS_JT"/> influenced in large part by Lillywhite's production. ''The Unforgettable Fire'', which began with the Edge playing more keyboards than guitars, as well as follow-up ''The Joshua Tree'', were produced by [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]]. With their influence, both albums achieved a "diverse texture".<ref name="RS_JT"/> The songs from ''The Joshua Tree'' and ''Rattle and Hum'' placed more emphasis on Lanois-inspired rhythm as they mixed distinct and varied styles of gospel and blues music, which stemmed from the band's fascination with America.

Clayton's style of bass guitar playing is noted for what instructor Patrick Pfeiffer called "harmonic [[syncopation]]". With this technique, Clayton plays a consistent rhythm that stresses the [[eighth note]] of each [[bar (music)|bar]], but he "anticipates the harmony by shifting the [[tonality]]" before the guitar chords do. This gives the music a feeling of "forward motion".<ref>Jobling (2014), p. 243</ref> In the band's early years, Clayton had no formal musical training,<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 30, 34</ref> and he generally played simple bass parts in [[4/4 time|{{music|time|4|4}} time]] consisting of steady eighth notes emphasising the roots of chords.<ref name="bassplayer-dec00">{{cite magazine|title=Reluctant Rock Star: How U2's Adam Clayton Learned to Play – and Conquer the World Onstage |magazine=[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]]|first=Gregory|last=Isola|date=December 2000 |volume=11|issue=12|pages=54+}}</ref> Over time, he incorporated influences from [[Motown#Motown sound|Motown]] and [[reggae]] into his playing style, and as he became a better timekeeper, his playing became more melodic.<ref name="bassplayer-dec00"/> Flanagan said that he "often plays with the swollen, vibrating bottom sound of a Jamaican [[Dub music|dub]] bassist, covering the most sonic space with the smallest number of notes".<ref name="flan208"/> Clayton relies on his own instincts when developing [[bassline]]s, deciding whether to follow the chord progressions of the guitars or play a [[counter-melody]], and when to play an octave higher or lower.<ref name="bp-groundcontrol">{{cite magazine|title=U2's Ground Control|magazine=[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]]|first=Brian|last=Fox|date=January 2006|volume=17|issue=1|pages=34–41, 43}}</ref> He cites bassists such as [[Paul Simonon]], [[Bruce Foxton]], [[Peter Hook]], [[Jean-Jacques Burnel]],<ref name="bassplayer-dec00"/> and [[James Jamerson]] as major influences on him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/22/adam-clayton-u2-soundtrack-of-my-life|title=Adam Clayton: Soundtrack of my life|website=[[The Guardian]]|last=Grundy |first=Gareth |date=22 May 2011|access-date=26 October 2018}}</ref> Describing his role in the rhythm section, Clayton said, "Larry's drums have always told me what to play, and then the chords tell me where to go".<ref name="bassplayer-dec00"/>

U2's lyrics are known for their social and political themes, and often contain Christian and spiritual imagery.<ref name="lyrics">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/arts/music/u2-the-catharsis-in-the-cathedral.html|title=The Catharsis in the Cathedral|first=Jon|last=Pareles|author-link=Jon Pareles|date=14 November 2004|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|at=sec. 2, p. 29|edition=National|access-date=17 August 2007}}</ref> Songs such as "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]", "Silver and Gold", and "[[Mothers of the Disappeared]]" were motivated by current events. The first was written about [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland,<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 135, 139</ref> while the last was a tribute to [[COMADRES]], the women whose children were killed or [[Forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]] at the hands of the Salvadoran government during the [[Salvadoran Civil War|country's civil war]].<ref>McGee (2008), p. 98</ref> The song "[[Running to Stand Still]]" from ''The Joshua Tree'' was inspired by the heroin addiction that was sweeping through Dublin—the lyric "I see seven towers, but I only see one way out" references the [[Ballymun Flats|Ballymun Towers]] of Dublin's Northside and the imagery throughout the song personifies the struggles of addiction.<ref>Stokes (1995), pp. 62–77</ref>

Bono's personal conflicts and turmoil inspired songs like "[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]", "[[Tomorrow (U2 song)|Tomorrow]]" and "[[Kite (U2 song)|Kite]]". An emotional yearning or pleading frequently appears as a lyrical theme,<ref name="ABOUT_TOP10">{{cite web|url=http://80music.about.com/od/artistsqu/tp/topu2songs.htm|first=Steve|last=Peake|title=Top 10 U2 Songs of the '80s|website=[[About.com]]|access-date=17 August 2010|archive-date=25 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525055736/http://80music.about.com/od/artistsqu/tp/topu2songs.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> in tracks such as "[[Yahweh (song)|Yahweh]]",<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/u2-how-to-dismantle-an-atomic-bomb|title=U2&nbsp;– How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb Review|magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=December 2004|page=136|issue=91|access-date=23 March 2016|archive-date=12 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412001955/http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/u2-how-to-dismantle-an-atomic-bomb|url-status=dead}}</ref> "[[Peace on Earth (U2 song)|Peace on Earth]]", and "[[Please (U2 song)|Please]]". Much of U2's songwriting and music is motivated by contemplations of loss and anguish, along with hopefulness and resilience, themes that are central to ''The Joshua Tree''.<ref name="RS_JT"/> Some of these lyrical ideas have been amplified by Bono and the band's personal experiences during their youth in Ireland, as well as Bono's campaigning and activism later in his life. U2 have used tours such as [[Zoo TV Tour|Zoo TV]] and [[PopMart Tour|PopMart]] to caricature social trends, such as media overload and consumerism, respectively.<ref name="NYT_POP"/>

While the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their songs, U2's lyrics and music were criticised as apolitical by ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in 2002 for their perceived vagueness and "fuzzy imagery", and a lack of any specific references to people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2002/01/u2.html|title=The soaring nothingness of U2|first=David|last=Plotz|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=25 January 2002|access-date=27 February 2013}}</ref>

Since the early 1980s, the members of U2—as a band and individually—have collaborated with other musicians, artists, celebrities, and politicians to address issues concerning poverty, disease, and social injustice.

In 1984, Bono and Clayton participated in [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] to raise money for the [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia]]. This initiative produced the hit charity single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]", the first of several collaborations between U2 and [[Bob Geldof]]. In July 1985, U2 performed at [[Live Aid]], a follow-up to Band Aid's efforts. Bono and his wife Ali, invited by [[World Vision]], visited Ethiopia that year where they witnessed the famine first-hand. Bono later said that this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting.<ref name=bonomission/><ref name="mcc289"/> In 1986, U2 participated in the [[Self Aid]] benefit concert for unemployment in Ireland and the [[Conspiracy of Hope]] benefit concert tour in support of [[Amnesty International]]. The same year, Bono and Ali also visited Nicaragua and El Salvador at the invitation of the [[Sanctuary movement]] and saw the effects of the [[Salvadoran Civil War]]. These 1986 events greatly influenced ''The Joshua Tree'' album, which was being recorded at the time.<ref name="McCormick 2006, p. 174"/><ref name=westwon/>

During their Zoo TV Tour in 1992, U2 participated in the "Stop [[Sellafield]]" concert with [[Greenpeace]] to protest a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 238</ref> Events in Sarajevo during the [[War in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian War]] inspired their song with Brian Eno called "[[Miss Sarajevo]]", which they debuted at a September 1995 [[Pavarotti & Friends]] concert to benefit the [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] charity.<ref name="McCormick 2006, p. 262"/> U2 fulfilled a 1993 promise to play in Sarajevo during the PopMart Tour in 1997.<ref name="McCormick 2006, p. 277"/> In May 1998, they performed in [[Belfast]] to promote [[1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum|Northern Ireland's referendum]] over the [[Good Friday Agreement]], which ended [[the Troubles]]. During the show, Bono brought Northern Irish political leaders [[David Trimble]] and [[John Hume]] on stage to shake hands; the referendum ultimately was passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotpress.com/opinion/on-this-day-in-1998-u2-ash-john-hume-and-david-trimble-took-part-in-the-historic-good-friday-agreement-gig-in-belfast-22906975|title=On this day in 1998: U2, Ash, John Hume and David Trimble took part in the historic Good Friday Agreement gig in Belfast|website=[[Hot Press]]|first=Stuart|last=Bailie|date=19 May 2022|access-date=31 March 2024}}</ref> Later that year, all proceeds from the release of the "[[Sweetest Thing]]" single went towards supporting the [[Chernobyl Children's Project International|Chernobyl Children's Project]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/herald/alis-chernobyl-trip-to-hit-screens/27883314.html|title=Ali's Chernobyl trip to hit screens|website=[[The Herald (Ireland)|The Herald]]|first=Lorna|last=Nolan|date=27 August 2008|access-date=20 June 2017}}</ref>

Since 2000, Bono's campaigning has included [[Jubilee 2000]] with Geldof, [[Muhammad Ali]], and others to promote the [[Debt relief|cancellation]] of [[Debt of developing countries|third-world debt]] during the [[Great Jubilee]]. In January 2002, Bono co-founded the multinational NGO [[DATA]], with the aim of improving the social, political, and financial state of Africa. He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV/AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high-profile visits to Africa.<ref>{{bulleted list|{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/05/24/bono.africa.cnna/index.html|title=CNN Access: Bono backs 'effective aid' for Africa|website=CNN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614020843/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/05/24/bono.africa.cnna/index.html|first=Aaron|last=Brown|date=24 May 2002|access-date=18 June 2010|archive-date=14 June 2012}}|{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/africa/05/30/bono.oneill.kagan.otsc/index.html|title=Bono and O'Neill in Africa: Summing up the trip|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406223349/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/africa/05/30/bono.oneill.kagan.otsc/index.html|website=CNN|first=Daryn|last=Kagan|date=30 May 2002|access-date=27 February 2013|archive-date=6 April 2013}}|{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/africa/06/20/Bono.chirac/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406210936/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/africa/06/20/bono.chirac/index.html|title=Bono wins Chirac aid boost pledge|website=CNN|date=21 June 2002|access-date=27 February 2013|archive-date=6 April 2013}}}}</ref> [[Product Red]], a for-profit licensed brand seeking to raise money for the [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria|Global Fund]], was co-founded by Bono in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bono unveils clothes brand|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|first=Gary|last=Silverman|date=26 January 2006}}</ref> The [[ONE Campaign]], originally the US counterpart of Make Poverty History, was shaped by his efforts and vision.
