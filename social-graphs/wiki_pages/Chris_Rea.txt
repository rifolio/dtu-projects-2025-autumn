But Middlesbrough in 1968 wasn't the place to be if you wanted to do movie scores".<ref name="Independent"/> Due to his late introduction to music and guitar playing, Rea commented that when compared to [[Mark Knopfler]] and [[Eric Clapton]], "I definitely missed the boat, I think".<ref name="Belfast"/> He was self-taught,<ref name="Ne4Me"/> and soon tried to join a friend's group, the Elastic Band, as the first choice for guitar or bass.

====Debut album====
[[File:Chris+Rea 1978 2.jpg|thumb|Rea in 1978]]
''[[Whatever Happened to Benny Santini?]]'', Rea's debut studio album, was released in June 1978, produced by [[Gus Dudgeon]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Billboard's Top Album Picks: For Week Ending 7/22/78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kyQEAAAAMBAJ|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=22 July 1978|volume=90|issue=29|page=94|access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref> The title referred to a stage name that Rea had suggested when the record label insisted that his given name did not sound "croony" enough.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/><ref name="Independent"/> It peaked at No. 49 on the [[Billboard Hot 200|''Billboard'' Hot 200]], and charted for 12 weeks.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/chris-rea/chart-history/tlp/|title=What Ever Happened To Benny Santini (Hot 200)|magazine=Billboard|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref> The lead single, "[[Fool (If You Think It's Over)]]", was Rea's biggest hit in the US, reaching No. 1 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary Singles]] chart, and No. 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="auto">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/chris-rea/chart-history/hsi/|title=Fool If You Think It's Over (Hot 100)|magazine=Billboard|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/chris-rea/chart-history/asi/|title=Fool If You Think It's Over (Adult Contemporary)|magazine=Billboard|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref> As Rea gave [[Magnet Records]] its first major breakthrough and its first US Top-10, he was their biggest artist, the more so when he was nominated at the [[21st Annual Grammy Awards]] as [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5gIpAAAAIBAJ&pg=2129,3598894&dq |title=Bee Gees Head Lists For 6 Grammy Awards |date=9 January 1979 |access-date=23 April 2010 |work=[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal|Daytona Beach Morning Journal]] |publisher=The News-Journal Corporation}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/chris-rea/6537 |title=Grammy Award Results for Chris Rea |website=[[Grammy Award|The Grammys]] |date=23 November 2020 |publisher=Recording Academy |access-date=22 December 2020}}</ref> Levy remembers him as "more of a thoughtful, introspective poet than a natural pop performer" which Levy felt stopped Rea from becoming a bigger star.<ref name="Levy2008"/> Few of Rea's early singles charted in the UK. "Fool" performed modestly on its second release in late 1978, prompted by its strong performance in the US, and that stateside success also led to Rea being categorized as a piano-playing singer-songwriter, similar to [[Elton John]] and [[Billy Joel]], rather than the guitar player he is.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> For several years, Magnet marketed him based on this misconception.<ref name="Belfast"/> Rea says that it "is still the only song I've ever not played guitar on, but it just so happened to be my first single".<ref name="Belfast"/> Rea has "always had a difficult relationship with fame, even before my first illness.

====Subsequent early albums====
Dudgeon also produced Rea's second album ''[[Deltics (album)|Deltics]]'' (1979). Rea recorded his self-produced third album, ''[[Tennis (album)|Tennis]]'' (1980), with musicians from Middlesbrough, and it received positive reviews.<ref name="DeNoyer"/> As both albums had failed commercially, Magnet rejected the artwork Rea wanted for the cover of his fourth album, 1981's ''[[Chris Rea (album)|Chris Rea]]'' (produced by [[Jon Kelly]], who later oversaw Rea's most successful albums).<ref name="DeNoyer"/> None of these albums reached the Top 50 in the UK, with his singles also delivering lacklustre performances. ''Diamonds'' reached No. 44 in the US, and ''[[Loving You (Chris Rea song)|Loving You]]'' went to No. 88 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/chris-rea/chart-history/hsi/|title=Diamonds (Hot 100)|magazine=Billboard|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/chris-rea/chart-history/hsi/|title=Loving You (Hot 100)|magazine=Billboard|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref> Rea had a difficult working relationship with Dudgeon and the other "men in suits" who he felt "smoothed out" the blues-influenced elements of his music.<ref name="Independent"/><ref>"Auf Wiedersehen", Pet..., ''Q'' magazine, February 1988, pp.33-4</ref><ref name="DeNoyer"/> Rea "always thought that [producers] knew best. I never thought for a minute that they might have another agenda", but "all of a sudden I was the goose that laid the golden egg, and it was hell for me".<ref name="Guardian02"/> He ruefully acknowledges, "I can't blame anyone but myself.

===1983–1988: European breakthrough===
====''Water Sign'' and ''Shamrock Diaries''====
[[File:Chris Rea. personal picture.jpg|thumb|Chris Rea in the 1980s]]
From 1983, Rea's music began to better reflect his wishes and capabilities, despite pressure from his record company due to the accumulated costs of the production for his first four albums. To keep costs low, the label decided to release the demo tapes of his fifth studio album ''[[Water Sign (Chris Rea album)|Water Sign]]''. It was the first of several successful albums on which Rea collaborated with producer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]].

==Musicianship==
===Guitars===
[[File:Chris Rea at the Heineken Music Hall - 2010-03-05.jpg|thumb|right|Rea playing his [[Italia Guitars|Italia Maranello]] "Bluey" at the [[Heineken Music Hall]], Amsterdam, 2010]]

Rea's first guitar was a [[Höfner]] V3 or 173 which he bought in a second-hand shop because, at the time, there were not that many shops in Middlesbrough where one could purchase a guitar.<ref name="Guardian02"/> He played the V3 until 1979, although, by Rea's reckoning, it was a "dreadful guitar with an appalling action, but playing slide it didn't matter".<ref name="GuitarFeature">{{cite news|url=http://www.theguitarmagazine.com/features/chris-rea/|title=How I got started... Chris Rea|date=18 March 2016|work=The Guitar Magazine|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> During his career the guitar most associated with him was a 1962 Fender Stratocaster which he called "Pinky". Rea bought the instrument after seeing a Ry Cooder concert at the [[Newcastle City Hall|City Hall]] in Newcastle.  The guitar once was submerged in water for three months and was more mellow in sound compared to the classic hard Stratocaster sound. Since 2002 ''[[Dancing Down the Stony Road]]'', his main guitar was an [[Italia Guitars|Italia Maranello]] he named "Bluey".<ref name="MusicRadar"/><ref name="GuitarFeature"/>

===Filmography===
One of his childhood dreams was to become a film writer and film music composer.<ref name="Post"/><ref name="Independent"/> Rea wrote the [[Soft Top, Hard Shoulder (song)|title track]] and music score for the 1993 drama film ''[[Soft Top Hard Shoulder]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/ondemand/softtop |title=Soft Top, Hard Shoulder – double BAFTA-winning comedy starring Peter Capaldi |access-date=29 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hello?

===References in lyrics===
Rea has acknowledged that several of his songs were "born out of [[Middlesbrough]]", his hometown.

{{blockquote|I went back to see my father after my mother had died and [they] had knocked the whole place down. I'd been gone three years, hard touring in Europe. I literally went to drive somewhere that wasn't there. It was like a sci-fi movie. The Middlesbrough I knew, it's as if there was a war there 10 years ago.<ref name="DeNoyer"/><ref>Auf Wiedersehen, Pet..., ''Q'', February 1988, p.34</ref>}}

{{blockquote|I miss the bits of Middlesbrough that aren't there any more. It's very hard to accept that [[Ayresome Park]] no longer exists. I know I sound very old when I say things like that. Those terraced streets are no longer there. But I miss the old character of the place, the guys with the fruit barrows and all that.<ref name="Ne4Me"/>}}

===Politics===
In a 2017 interview, amid the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Rea supported [[Jeremy Corbyn]] and even wrote a song called "What's So Wrong With A Man Who Tells The Truth?", saying "in the old way, Corbyn is useless.

But the young people have had enough".<ref name="Yates17"/> Rea considers that the politicians and government of the UK and EU became out of touch with the common people.<ref name="Kyiv"/> He is sceptical about the idea of unification of Europe because with a common European market "you [...] force different people to live together [when] they simply do not want to",<ref name="Kyiv"/> recalling the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|downfall]] of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref name="Kyiv"/>
