'''The Go-Go's''' are an American all-female [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1978.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide Rock: The Definitive Guide to More than 1200 Artists and Bands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&q=the+go-go%27s+rock+the+rough+guide&pg=PT437|first1=Peter |last1=Buckley |first2=Ben |last2=Browton |first3=Jill |last3=Furmanovsky |first4=Charlie|last4=Gillett|page=430|publisher=Rough Guides|date=November 2003|isbn=978-1-84353-105-0}}</ref> Except for short periods when other musicians joined briefly, the band has had a relatively stable lineup consisting of [[Charlotte Caffey]] on [[lead guitar]] and [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[Belinda Carlisle]] on lead vocals, [[Gina Schock]] on drums, [[Kathy Valentine]] on [[bass guitar|bass]], and [[Jane Wiedlin]] on [[rhythm guitar]]. 

The quintet emerged from the L.A. [[punk rock]] scene of the late 1970s and in 1981 released their debut album ''[[Beauty and the Beat (The Go-Go's album)|Beauty and the Beat]]''. A first for an all-female band writing their material and playing their instruments, the LP topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|album chart]] and remains an achievement yet to be matched.<ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the go-go's|bio=true}} |title=The Go-Go's Music News & Info |magazine=Billboard |access-date=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |date=March 6, 2022 |title=Chart Rewind: In 1982, The Go-Go's Got the 'Beat' to a Historic No. 1 |url=https://www.billboard.com/pro/go-gos-beauty-and-the-beat-rewinding-the-charts-1982/ |access-date=August 10, 2023 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> ''Beauty and the Beat'' is considered one of the "cornerstone albums of US [[New wave music|new wave]]" ([[AllMusic]]), having broken barriers and paved the way for a host of other new American acts.  It yielded two of the Go-Go's four biggest [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot&nbsp;100]] hits—"[[Our Lips Are Sealed]]" (no.&nbsp;20) and "[[We Got the Beat]]" (no.&nbsp;2)—and, after a long and steady climb, reached number one in the chart dated March&nbsp;6, 1982. The album stayed at the top for six consecutive weeks, eventually selling over two million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=beauty+and+the+beat#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum|publisher=RIAA|access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> The group, credited as simply '''Go-Go's''' on all of their US releases, was nominated for the [[Best New Artist]] award at the [[24th Annual Grammy Awards]].

Two more albums followed: ''[[Vacation (The Go-Go's album)|Vacation]]'' (1982)—whose [[Vacation (The Go-Go's song)|title track]] reached no.&nbsp;8 on ''Billboard's'' Hot&nbsp;100—and ''[[Talk Show (The Go-Go's album)|Talk Show]]'' (1984), which included the hits "[[Head over Heels (Go-Go's song)|Head over Heels]]" (no. 11) and "[[Turn to You]]" (no.&nbsp;32).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicvf.com/The+Go-Go%27s.art|title=The Go-Go's Songs • Top Songs / Chart Singles Discography|website=Musicvf.com}}</ref> The Go-Go's have sold more than seven million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_60/93_belinda_carlisle.html |title=Belinda Carlisle |website=AskMen.com |access-date=June 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011012411/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/women/singer_60/93_belinda_carlisle.html |archive-date=October 11, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-go-gos-beauty-and-the-beat/ |title=The Go-Go's: Beauty and the Beat |date=October 20, 2019 |website=Pitchfork.com |access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref>

The Go-Go's broke up in 1985, with each member embarking on a solo career and Carlisle being the most successful, having several top-5 singles through the late 1980s. They reconvened several times in the 1990s, releasing a new album in 2001, ''[[God Bless the Go-Go's]]'', and touring. They received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/go-gos/|title=The Go-Go's|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=June 18, 2021}}</ref> Though the band's 2016 performances were billed as a farewell tour, the band remained active on an ad hoc basis for several years afterward.

==History==
===Original incarnation (1978–1980)===
Formed in Los Angeles in 1978 as the Misfits<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/500308/belinda-carlisle/|work=MTV|title=Belinda Carlisle|access-date=January 26, 2017|archive-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202031935/http://www.mtv.com/news/500308/belinda-carlisle/|url-status=dead}}</ref> by [[Charlotte Caffey]] (guitar), [[Belinda Carlisle]] (vocals), [[Jane Wiedlin]] (guitar, background vocals), the Go-Go's also included Margot Olavarria on bass and Elissa Bello on drums.<ref>White, S. (2016). ''The Go-Go's: A YinPop Guide.'' Fly-By-Night Books, {{ISBN|978-0-9905386-4-6}}</ref>

They were formed as a [[punk rock|punk]] band and had roots in the L.A. punk community.<ref>Hudak, Joseph. (June 22, 2012) [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-go-gos/biography The Go-Go's Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921144518/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-go-gos/biography |date=September 21, 2017 }}. Rolling Stone. Retrieved 2015-09-14.</ref> They shared a rehearsal space with [[the Motels]] and Carlisle, under the name "Dottie Danger", had briefly been a member of punk rock band [[Germs (band)|the Germs]]. After Carlisle became temporarily ill, she separated from the Germs before ever playing a gig.

The band began playing gigs at punk venues such as [[The Masque]] and the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Los Angeles and the [[Mabuhay Gardens]] in San Francisco alongside bands such as [[X (U.S. band)|X]], [[Fear (band)|Fear]], [[the Plugz]] and [[The Controllers (Los Angeles band)|the Controllers]]. [[Charlotte Caffey]] (lead guitar, keyboards, background vocals) was added later in 1978, and in the summer of 1979, [[Gina Schock]] replaced Bello on drums. With these lineup changes, the group began moving towards their more familiar [[power pop]] sound.

The group frequently met at a [[Denny's]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in Hollywood, and it was there they chose the band's name.

In late 1979, the band recorded a five-song demo at [[Gold Star Studios]] in Los Angeles, and in 1980, they supported the British [[ska revival]] groups [[Madness (band)|Madness]] and [[The Specials]] in both Los Angeles and England. The Go-Go's subsequently spent half of 1980 touring England, earning a sizable following and releasing the demo version of "[[We Got the Beat]]" on [[Stiff Records]], which became a minor UK hit.<ref name="Ellwood, 2020">{{cite AV media

In December 1980, original bassist Olavarria fell ill<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/the-go-gos-we-got-the-beat-35th-anniversary-interview-billboard-music-awards-7378161/|title=The Go-Go's Recall the Debauched Days of Their Hit 'We Got the Beat' 35 Years Later: 'We Were a Five-Headed Monster'|magazine=Billboard}}
</ref> and was replaced with [[Kathy Valentine]], who had played guitar in bands such as [[Girlschool]] and the Textones. Valentine had not previously played bass guitar. Carlisle also related in her autobiography, ''Lips Unsealed'', that according to the band's view, another reason for Olavarria's dismissal from the Go-Go's was that she frequently missed rehearsals, due largely to her dissatisfaction with the band's move away from punk and toward pop. In late 1982, Olavarria sued the remaining band members for wrongful removal. The lawsuit was settled in 1984. Olavarria later joined [[Martin Atkins]]' band Brian Brain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/632672-Margot-Olavarria|title=Margot Olavarria|publisher=discogs|access-date=April 28, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206131541/https://www.discogs.com/artist/632672-Margot-Olavarria|archive-date=February 6, 2018}}</ref>

===Career peak (1981–1983)===
[[File:The Go Go's - Los Angeles Times (1981).jpg|thumb|Belinda Carlisle performing with the Go-Go's in 1981]]
The Go-Go's signed to [[Miles_Copeland_III|Miles Copeland's]] label ''[[I.R.S. Records]]'' in April 1981. The following year they toured with [[The Police]], who were managed by Copeland, on the [[Ghost in the Machine Tour]]. The Go-Go's debut album, ''[[Beauty and the Beat (The Go-Go's album)|Beauty and the Beat]]'', was a surprise hit: it topped the U.S. charts for six weeks in 1982 and eventually received a double platinum certification. The album was also successful outside the U.S., charting at No. 2 in Canada, where it received a platinum certification, and No. 27 in Australia. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 413 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. "[[Our Lips Are Sealed]]" and a new version of "We Got the Beat" were popular singles in North America in early 1982. During this period, the Go-Go's started building a fanbase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://musicremedy.com/b/Belinda_Carlisle/album/Voila-3613.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020033938/http://musicremedy.com/b/Belinda_Carlisle/album/Voila-3613.html|url-status=dead|title=Belinda Carlisle - Voila|archive-date=October 20, 2008|access-date=August 20, 2025}}</ref>

In 1982, the group was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best New Artist]].<ref>White, S. (2016). ''The Go-Go's: A YinPop Guide.'' Fly-By-Night Books, p. 21, {{ISBN|978-0-9905386-4-6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1982/grammys.htm|title=Rock On The Net: 24th Annual Grammy Awards - 1982|website=Rockonthenet.com}}</ref>

The follow-up album, ''[[Vacation (The Go-Go's album)|Vacation]]'', received mixed reviews and sold less than ''Beauty and the Beat''. However, the album was certified gold in the U.S. and spawned another Top 10 U.S. hit with [[Vacation (The Go-Go's song)|the title track]]. Other singles released from the album were "Get Up and Go" and "This Old Feeling", neither of which made it into the Top 40. In 1983, ''Vacation'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Packaging. During the album's promotion, the group went on hiatus when Schock underwent surgery for a [[congenital heart defect]].

===''Talk Show'' and initial breakup (1984–1985)===
[[File:GoGos1984TurnToYou.jpg|thumb|Belinda Carlisle and Jane Wiedlin in the "Turn to You" music video]]
In 1984, the group returned with the [[Martin Rushent]]-produced album ''[[Talk Show (The Go-Go's album)|Talk Show]]''. The album tracks "[[Head over Heels (The Go-Go's song)|Head over Heels]]" and "[[Turn to You]]" were both Top 40 hits in the US. Despite the favorable reception, the album sold less than the previous two, not reaching the top 10 and not receiving any certification.

Personality conflicts and creative differences within the group were also taking a toll, as were drug addiction problems for some band members. Wiedlin announced her departure from the group in October 1984. The band sought a replacement, selecting Paula Jean Brown (of [[Giant Sand]]) as their new bass guitarist, with Valentine moving to rhythm guitar. This lineup debuted at the 1985 [[Rock in Rio]] festival, playing two shows, but Carlisle and Caffey soon realized their hearts were no longer in the group and decided to disband the Go-Go's in May 1985.

===Reunions and lawsuit (1990–1999)===
In 1990, the Go-Go's classic lineup (Caffey, Carlisle, Schock, Valentine, and Wiedlin) reunited to play a benefit concert for the California Environmental Protection Act, a 1990 ballot initiative. The band also entered the studio with producer [[David Z (music producer)|David Z]] to re-record a cover of "[[Cool Jerk]]" (a song they had previously covered on their second LP) for a [[greatest hits]] compilation.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

In 1994, the same lineup got together again to release a two-disc retrospective entitled ''[[Return to the Valley of The Go-Go's]]'', featuring three new recordings. The single "[[The Whole World Lost Its Head]]" peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts and "bubbled under" on the US charts at No. 108, and became the band's first and only Top 40 hit in the UK, peaking at No. 29. The band toured again to promote the release; ex-[[The Bangles|Bangle]] [[Vicki Peterson]] stood in on several dates for Caffey, who was pregnant.<ref name=":0" />

In 1997, Schock sued the other group members, claiming that she had not been adequately paid for her contributions since 1986 and that a songwriting agreement with Caffey had been breached. The suit was resolved by 1999 and the Go-Go's toured regularly from 1999 onward.

===''God Bless the Go-Go's'' (2000–2009)===
[[File:The Go-Gos - Belinda Carlisle, Kathy Valentine and Gina Schock.jpg|thumb|The band in Austin, Texas, 2008. L to R: Belinda Carlisle, Gina Schock, and Kathy Valentine. Off frame: Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey.]]In 2001, the band (still with the "classic" lineup) released an album of new material, ''[[God Bless the Go-Go's]]''. [[Green Day]]'s lead singer [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] co-wrote the only released single, "[[Unforgiven (The Go-Go's song)|Unforgiven]]", which peaked at No. 22 on Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart. The album was well received by critics and peaked at number 57 in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} The band also released a [[DVD]] of their reunion concert in [[Central Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Go-Go's: Live in Central Park (2001)|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/gogosliveincentralpark.shtml|access-date=2021-11-28|website=Dvdmg.com}}</ref>

Also in 2001, the Go-Go's, along with artists [[Elton John]], [[Billy Joel]], [[David Crosby]] and [[Paul Simon]], performed at the concert "[[A Tribute To Brian Wilson|An All-Star Tribute to Brian Wilson]]" at [[Radio City Music Hall]], hosted by the [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] network.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gowers|first=Bruce|title=An All-Star Tribute to Brian Wilson|date=2001-07-04|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289660/|type=Music|access-date=2021-11-24}}</ref>

In 2002 the Go-Go's recorded the theme song for the [[The WB|WB]] comedy series "[[Do Over]]". Written by  Charlotte Caffey, Kathy Valentine, and Jane Wiedlin, the track was recorded in Los Angeles for the show, which premiered on Sept. 19 on the network.<ref>{{Cite magazine|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2002-08-20|title=Billboard Bits: Ash, Snoop Dogg, Go-Go's|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/billboard-bits-ash-snoop-dogg-go-gos-74498/|access-date=2021-11-24|magazine=Billboard|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 2004 the band hosted a concert in [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]] together with [[The Motels]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Go-Go's's Concert & Tour History {{!}} Concert Archives|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/the-go-go-s|access-date=2021-11-24|website=Concertarchives.org}}</ref>

===Farewell tour, departure (and return) of Kathy Valentine and Broadway musical (2010–2019)===
[[File:The Go Gos in 2012.jpg|thumb|The band performing in 2012]]
In February 2010, Carlisle announced that the 2010 tour would be billed as the "Farewell Tour",<ref>[http://www.rockstarweekly.com/content/view/1451/149/] {{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> but this tour was canceled when Wiedlin injured her knee while hiking near her home in Northern California, requiring surgery and up to a year of recovery time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://janewiedlin.com/2010/06/14/message-from-jane-2/ |title=Message from Jane @ Jane Wiedlin.com |website=Janewiedlin.com |access-date=August 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810013930/http://janewiedlin.com/2010/06/14/message-from-jane-2/ |archive-date=August 10, 2011 }}</ref>

After 2010, the idea of a farewell tour seemed to have been abandoned, with the Go-Go's touring frequently. In 2011, the Go-Go's announced the "Ladies Gone Wild" tour to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of ''Beauty and the Beat''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gogos.com/index.php |title=Go-Go's - Ladies Gone Wild! |website=Gogos.com |access-date=August 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404220930/http://www.gogos.com/index.php |archive-date=April 4, 2011 }}</ref> They toured the US in 2012, with [[Abby Travis]] subbing for an injured Valentine during the latter part of the tour.
