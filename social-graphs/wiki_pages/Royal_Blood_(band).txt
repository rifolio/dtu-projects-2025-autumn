'''Royal Blood''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] duo formed in [[Worthing]] in 2011. The current lineup consists of Mike Kerr (vocals, bass guitar, piano) and Ben Thatcher (drums). Their signature sound is built around Kerr's bass playing style, which sees him using various [[effects pedal]]s and [[Guitar amplifier|amps]] to make his bass guitar sound like an electric guitar and bass guitar at the same time. The duo were signed by [[Warner Chappell Music]] in 2013 and have since released four studio albums: ''[[Royal Blood (album)|Royal Blood]]'' (2014), ''[[How Did We Get So Dark?]]'' (2017),  ''[[Typhoons (album)|Typhoons]]'' (2021), and ''[[Back to the Water Below]]'' (2023).
