'''Saving Abel''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Corinth, Mississippi]], founded in 2004 by Jason Null and Jared Weeks. The band is named after the [[Bible|biblical]] story of [[Cain and Abel]], in which a man named Cain kills his brother Abel. Band member Jason Null thought up the band title saying "I Googled the story of Cain and Abel and found a line about 'there was no saving Abel', which just jumped out at me".<ref name="bandbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.savingabel.us/bio.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716012740/http://www.savingabel.us/ |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |title=Biography|publisher=Saving Abel Official website|access-date=December 28, 2012}}</ref>

== History ==
Lead guitarist Jason Null and lead singer Jared Weeks began forming Saving Abel in the small town of [[Corinth, Mississippi]], in 2004. Weeks was learning to play the guitar at his best friend's house and Null, who was in a competing rock band in the same town, walked in to rehearse, hit it off, and several days later were writing songs together. Early in 2005, their songs caught the ear of noted producer Skidd Mills, who brought the two into his 747 Studio in Memphis, Tennessee to record some of the songs.<ref name="bandbio"/>

The band gradually came together with the addition of rhythm guitarist Scott Bartlett, bassist Daniel Dwight, and drummer Blake Dixon. Weeks would throw demo CDs onto the stages of bigger bands that toured through Corinth.<ref name="bandbio"/> After shopping the album around for almost a year, and a member change as original bassist Daniel Dwight left the group, they picked up bassist and long time friend Eric Taylor.

"[[Addicted (Saving Abel song)|Addicted]]" was first played on Memphis radio station, WMFS, where program director, Rob Cressman featured the song in regular rotation based on its strong local appeal. "Addicted" was then heard by a [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] A&R consultant, who e-mailed the song to CEO of Virgin Music Company Jason Flom. Flom liked what he heard and sent Kim Stephens to watch the band perform in [[Jackson, Tennessee]].<ref name="musicrem">{{cite web |publisher=MusicRemedy |title=Saving Abel to release self-titled |url=http://musicremedy.com/s/saving-abel/album/selftitled-4821.html |first=Jermy|last=Leeuwis|date=December 9, 2008|access-date=December 28, 2012}}</ref> "Addicted" was released in March 2008 as a single followed by their major label debut, ''[[Saving Abel (album)|Saving Abel]]'', on March 11, 2008.
