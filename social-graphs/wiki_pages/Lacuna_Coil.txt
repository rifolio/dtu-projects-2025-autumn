'''Lacuna Coil''' is an Italian [[gothic metal]] band from [[Milan]]. Since their formation in 1994, the group has had two name changes, being previously known as '''Sleep of Right''' and '''Ethereal''',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://events.pe.com/beaumont_tx/events/show/306015525-sevendust-with-lacuna-coil-and-avatar |title=Sevendust with Lacuna Coil and Avatar at Dixie Dance Hall |publisher=Events.PE |access-date=16 February 2013 |archive-date=22 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022195428/http://events.pe.com/beaumont_tx/events/show/306015525-sevendust-with-lacuna-coil-and-avatar |url-status=dead }}</ref> and they have recorded ten studio albums, two extended plays, two live albums, two compilation albums, one video album, and sixteen singles and music videos.

They have toured internationally and were nominated in 2006 for a [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Italian Act|MTV Europe Music Award]]. They won the 2012 [[Metal Female Voices Fest]] Award for the Best Album, the 2016 Metal Hammer Award for the Best International Band, and the 2018 [[Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards|Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award]] for Best Live Act. The band's 2012 release, ''[[Dark Adrenaline]]'', peaked at number 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. As of March 2012, Lacuna Coil have sold over two million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-p-t-concertreviews-156/13630-live-review-paradise-lost-herford-2013|title=Live Review: Paradise Lost - Herford 2013|date=9 November 2013 |publisher=Reflections of Darkness}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and debut EP (1994–1998)===
Vocalist [[Andrea Ferro]] and bassist/composer Marco Coti Zelati formed '''Sleep of Right''' in Milan, Italy, 1994,{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and recruited Raffaele Zagaria on guitars, and Michaelangelo Algardi on the drums. After recording a song titled "Bleeding Souls" for the ''Noise of Bolgia'' compilation in 1995, Claudio Leo became the band's second guitarist, and Leonardo Forti replaced Michaelangelo on the drums after his departure. The band asked [[Cristina Scabbia]], a friend and girlfriend of Marco at the time, to sing background vocals briefly, which led to her officially joining the band. Soon after, the band changed their name to '''Ethereal''', and signed to [[Century Media Records|Century Media]] at the end of 1997. Finding that the name Ethereal was already taken by a Greek band, they changed their name to Lacuna Coil (meaning "empty spiral", which reflected the band's vision on life).<ref name=spyral>{{cite web|url=http://www.emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=95 |title=Emptyspiral.net - The Lacuna Coil Community |access-date=14 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122948/http://www.emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=95 |archive-date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>

Lacuna Coil released a self-titled [[extended play|EP]] through Century Media in 1998, shortly after Raffaele Zagaria, Claudio Leo, and Leonardo Forti departed. As a result, guitarist Cristiano Migliore and drummer Cristiano Mozzati were recruited officially. At this point, the band was touring with [[Moonspell]] after the release of the [[Lacuna Coil (EP)|''Lacuna Coil EP'']].

===''In a Reverie'' (1998–2000)===
Following a second European tour, the band recorded their debut full-length album ''[[In a Reverie]]'' and added second guitarist Marco Biazzi. The band supported the album with another European tour, co-headlining with [[Skyclad (band)|Skyclad]]. [[Allmusic]] rated the album 4 stars, saying it was "a fine debut by a band that bears watching." The band toured mostly around Europe, generally as a support act.

===''Halflife'' EP and ''Unleashed Memories'' (2000–2002)===
Following their debut, ''In a Reverie'', the EP ''[[Halflife (EP)|Half-Life]]'' was released in 2000 with five songs: "Half Life", "Hyperfast", "Stars" (a cover of a [[Dubstar]] single), "Trance Awake" and a demo version of "Senzafine". The final version of the latter was included in the 2001 album ''[[Unleashed Memories]]''. While the studio album contained 10 songs, later re-releases included the ''Halflife'' EP. That same year, the band toured the United States for the first time, supporting [[Moonspell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/moonspell-frontman-comments-on-nocturnal-mourning-tour/|title=MOONSPELL Frontman Comments On 'Nocturnal Mourning' Tour|date=19 June 2006|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emptyspiral.net/features/lacuna-coil-biography/|title=Lacuna Coil Biography|date=23 December 2011}}</ref>

They kicked off their first headlining U.S. tour in 2003, supported by [[Dog Fashion Disco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacunacoil.it/biography/ |title=Biography |publisher=Lacunacoil.it |access-date=15 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325121422/http://www.lacunacoil.it/biography/ |archive-date=25 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apeshit.org/news/lacuna-coil-return-to-headline-us-tour/ |title=LACUNA COIL Return To Headline US Tour &#124; News |publisher=Apeshit |date=11 November 2003 |access-date=15 February 2013}}</ref> Networks such as Fuse played the song's video, for example.

The second single, "[[Swamped (song)|Swamped]]", was played in heavy rotation and used in the video game ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines]]''. It also appeared on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]''. Videos were filmed for both songs and broadcast on [[MTV2]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'', which also saw the band perform an acoustic rendition of "Heaven's a Lie" live.

By 2004, ''Comalies'' had become the best-selling CD in [[Century Media]]'s history. The band appeared at [[Ozzfest]] in between headlining club tours in the United States and Europe. A bonus, extended version of ''Comalies'' was released both in stores and on iTunes. This version consisted of both live and acoustic versions of the songs "Heaven's A Lie", "Swamped", "Unspoken", "Aeon" and "Senzafine" from ''Unleashed Memories''.

===''Karmacode'' (2005–2008)===
The band and label postponed the release of their follow-up to ''Comalies'', ''[[Karmacode]]'', to early 2006. According to the band's website, this made it possible for more time to be spent on production and to avoid the crowded summer 2005 release schedule for metal albums. On 23 December 2005 the band announced on their web site that all recording, mixing, and mastering on ''Karmacode'' had been completed. It was then announced that ''Karmacode'' would be released in the United States on 4 April 2006.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

That summer they also played on the main stage of the [[Download Festival]] (a three-day music festival in England's [[Donington Park]]), which was headlined by [[Metallica]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], and [[Guns N' Roses]]. That December, Lacuna Coil teamed up with In Flames, The Sword and Seemless for a US tour, as well as The Blackest of the Black 2006 Tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Four singles were officially released from ''Karmacode'': "[[Our Truth]]", "[[Closer (Lacuna Coil song)|Closer]]", "[[Within Me]]" and a cover of [[Depeche Mode]]'s "[[Enjoy the Silence (Lacuna Coil song)|Enjoy the Silence]]". "[[Our Truth]]" was the first single released and had a music video produced for it. The song was featured on the ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'' soundtrack and entered the top forty on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] chart in the United States.<ref name="billboard1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/lacuna-coil |title=Lacuna Coil: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |access-date=10 June 2010}}</ref>

Lacuna Coil's first live DVD was released in November 2008, entitled ''[[Visual Karma (Body, Mind and Soul)]]''.

In 2008, it was announced that Lacuna Coil's fifth studio album would be produced by Don Gilmore and would include some [[Arabia|Arabic]] influences. [[Cristina Scabbia]] explained in the magazine [[Rock Sound]]: "It's different, but it's our style. We haven't done anything absolutely different from our style, because that wouldn't be natural, that would be weird - it wouldn't be us. The songs are definitely more powerful, more complete, more intense, more straight-to-the-point." [[Andrea Ferro]] said: "We've put more attention on the real meaning of the songs, so the vocals are a bit more prominent. We've worked a lot with Don Gilmore on the pronunciation of the words in English, so people really understand the meanings of the words. There are strong choruses, where people can relate and really understand what we mean."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=110811|title=LACUNA COIL Discusses 'Shallow Life' Album Concept, Working With LINKIN PARK Producer|date=14 December 2008|access-date=12 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606064349/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=110811|archive-date=6 June 2011}}</ref>

In a September 2023 interview with KNAC, lead vocalist, [[Cristina Scabbia]], revealed that the band had written five or six songs but decided to delay recording a full album, explaining, "We really base our inspiration on life, on experiences, and to be honest, we didn't want to write a record about the pandemic. We wanted to go out again, meet people, live experiences, live life, and get ready to bring everything into our music again. So, we've collected a ton of material."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=September 29, 2023 |title=KNAC Interview with Lacuna Coil |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK3M0MD85T4 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221028210628/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK3M0MD85T4&feature=youtu.be |archive-date=October 28, 2022 |access-date=February 11, 2025 |website=KNAC}}</ref>

Our world is marred by strife and sorrow, with individuals grappling with feelings of isolation, anxiety, and despair. The external pressures bear down heavily, obscuring our vision and clouding our judgment."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=19 April 2024 |title=LACUNA COIL - LACUNA COIL {{!}} Century Media Records |url=https://www.centurymedia.com/new/lacuna-coil-5-1-1 |access-date=21 April 2024 |website=Century Media Records - Quality in Metal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=19 April 2024 |title=Hear Lacuna Coil get ridiculously heavy on new single In The Mean Time, featuring Ash Costello from New Years Day |url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/lacuna-coil-new-single-in-the-mean-time-ash-costello-new-years-day |access-date=21 April 2024 |website=Louder {{!}} Rock, Metal, Alternative Music & Culture}}</ref> 

A music video directed by [[Patric Ullaeus]] and starring [http://andreasbaras.com/ Andreas Barås] accompanied the release.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web |date=19 April 2024 |title=Lacuna Coil - In the Mean Time (2024) {{!}} IMVDb |url=https://imvdb.com/video/lacuna-coil/in-the-mean-time |access-date=21 April 2024 |website=IMVDb {{!}} The Internet Music Video Database}}</ref>

The band will be hitting big festival stages at Rockville, [[Sonic Temple (festival)|Sonic Temple]], and the Milwaukee Metal Festival.<ref name=":0" />

Costello expressed gratitude, stating, "I am deeply honored to join Lacuna Coil on tour for the first time, to have the incredible opportunity to lend my guest vocals to a new track and appear in the music video. Working alongside the powerhouse vocalist [[Cristina Scabbia|Cristina]] has been a privilege, and I may be biased in saying that 'In the Mean Time' has quickly become my favorite by Lacuna Coil. Its message about embracing individuality and not conforming deeply resonates with me."<ref name=":0" />

On the same day, Lacuna Coil announced a tour in the United Kingdom and Ireland called "In the Meantime," scheduled from 15 October 2024 to 26 October 2024 with support from Finnish nu metal band, [[Blind Channel]].<ref name=":0" />

== Musical style==

Lacuna Coil's music has been described as being "heavy, melodic, and relentlessly melodramatic".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dark-adrenaline-mw0002281946 |title=Dark Adrenaline Review by   |last=Monger |first=James Christopher |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2023-03-30}}</ref> Inspired by the combination of [[Gothic aesthetics|gothic]] imagery and music, the members have been known, musically, for composing mid-tempo songs consisting of prominent guitar lines and contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies to help create a melodic, detached sound. Much of the band's recent material, however, sees a heavier and more down-tuned style, featuring a more distinct bass line and a higher mixing of the guitars within the songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/reviews/details.cfm?releaseid=246 |title=Lacuna Coil - "Karmacode" CD Review - in Metal Reviews |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=10 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/11535/tempidx/4/menuid/2 |title=Review: Lacuna Coil - Karmacode |publisher=Blistering.com |date=22 November 2007 |access-date=10 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325124723/http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/link/1/templateid/11535/tempidx/4/menuid/2 |archive-date=25 March 2012 }}</ref>
