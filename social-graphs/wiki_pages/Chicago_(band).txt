'''Chicago''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Chicago]], Illinois, in 1967. Self-described as a "[[rock and roll]] band with [[Horn (instrument)|horns]]", their songs often also combine elements of [[classical music]], [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[pop music]].

Growing out of several bands from the Chicago area in the late 1960s, the original line-up consisted of [[Peter Cetera]] on bass, [[Terry Kath]] on guitar, [[Robert Lamm]] on keyboards, 
[[Lee Loughnane]] on trumpet, [[James Pankow]] on trombone, [[Walter Parazaider]] on [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], and [[Danny Seraphine]] on drums. Cetera, Kath, and Lamm shared lead vocal duties. The group initially called themselves '''The Big Thing''', then changed to the '''Chicago Transit Authority''' in 1968, and finally shortened the name to '''Chicago''' in 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://chicagotheband.com/a-chicago-story/ |title=A Chicago Story |publisher=Chicago Live Events |access-date=2025-01-02 |archive-date=October 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030061450/https://chicagotheband.com/a-chicago-story/ |url-status=live|language=en-US }}</ref>

[[Laudir de Oliveira]] joined the band as a percussionist and second drummer in 1974. Kath died in 1978 and was replaced by several guitarists in succession. [[Bill Champlin]] joined in 1981, providing vocals, keyboards, and rhythm guitar. Cetera left the band in 1985 and was replaced by [[Jason Scheff]]. Seraphine left in 1990 and was replaced by [[Tris Imboden]]. Although the band's lineup has been more fluid since 2009, Lamm, Loughnane, and Pankow have remained constant members. Parazaider "officially retired" in 2017.<ref name=":4" /><ref name="Durchholz" /><ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagotheband.com/band-members/|access-date=November 2, 2018|title=Chicago Band Members|website=chicagotheband.com|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210320010240/https://chicagotheband.com/band-members/|archive-date=March 20, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="chicagotheband.com">{{Cite web|url=https://chicagotheband.com/tribute-to-founding-members/|title=Tribute to Founding Members – Chicago|website=chicagotheband.com|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810235659/https://chicagotheband.com/tribute-to-founding-members/|archive-date=August 10, 2018|url-status=dead|access-date=August 10, 2018}}</ref> In 2021, he revealed he had been diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="VCF" />

== History ==
=== The Big Thing ===
The group now known as Chicago began on February 15, 1967, at a meeting involving saxophonist [[Walter Parazaider]], guitarist [[Terry Kath]], drummer [[Danny Seraphine]], trombonist [[James Pankow]], trumpet player [[Lee Loughnane]], and keyboardist/singer [[Robert Lamm]]. Kath, Parazaider, and Seraphine had played together previously in two other groups—Jimmy Ford and the Executives, and the Missing Links.<ref name="Seraphine"/>{{rp|29–49}} Parazaider had met Pankow and Loughnane when they were all students at [[DePaul University]].<ref name="Seraphine"/>{{rp|48–49}} Lamm, a student at [[Roosevelt University]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/02/14/robert-lamm-founding-member-of-chicago-looks-back-on-bands-history-ahead-of-rock-hall-of-fame-induction/|title=Robert Lamm, Founding Member Of Chicago, Looks Back On Band's History Ahead Of Rock Hall Of Fame Induction|last=Williams|first=Jim|date=February 14, 2016|work=CBSChicago|access-date=July 3, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703220356/https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/02/14/robert-lamm-founding-member-of-chicago-looks-back-on-bands-history-ahead-of-rock-hall-of-fame-induction/|archive-date=July 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> was recruited from his group, Bobby Charles and the Wanderers.<ref name="Seraphine"/>{{rp|49}} The group of six called themselves the Big Thing, and like most other groups playing in Chicago nightclubs, played Top 40 hits. Realizing the need for both a [[tenor]] to complement [[baritone]]s Lamm and Kath, and a bass player because Lamm's use of organ bass pedals did not provide "adequate bass sound", local tenor and bassist [[Peter Cetera]] was invited to join the Big Thing in late 1967.<ref name="Ruhlmannp1">{{cite AV media notes|title= Chicago Group Portrait (Box Set)|year= 1991|url= http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_1.html|page= 1|access-date= January 29, 2016|first= William James|last= Ruhlmann|format= CD booklet archived online|publisher= Columbia Records|location= New York City, NY|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160214052811/http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_1.html|archive-date= February 14, 2016|url-status=live|df= mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Seraphine"/>{{rp|58–59}}

=== 1970s: ''Chicago'' ===
[[File:Chicago band 1973.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Chicago circa 1973]]
In 1970, less than a year after its first album, the band released a second album, titled ''[[Chicago (album)|Chicago]]'' (retroactively known as ''Chicago II''), which is another double-LP. The album's centerpiece track is a seven-part, 13-minute [[suite (music)|suite]] composed by Pankow called "[[Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon]]". The suite yielded two top ten hits: "[[Make Me Smile]]" (No.&nbsp;9 U.S.) and "[[Colour My World (Chicago song)|Colour My World]]",<ref name= BBChicagoHot100 /> both sung by Kath. Among the other tracks on the album: Lamm's dynamic but cryptic "[[25 or 6 to 4]]" (Chicago's first Top 5 hit),<ref name=BBChicagoHot100 /> which is a reference to a songwriter trying to write at 25 or 26 minutes before 4 o'clock in the morning,<ref>{{cite interview|last=Lamm|first=Robert|subject-link=Robert Lamm|interviewer=Devon Maloney|title=Chicago Comes to Agganis|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2009/chicago-comes-to-agganis/|work=BU Today|publisher=Boston University|location=Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.|date=June 15, 2009|access-date=February 13, 2017|quote=It's a reference to time.

''[[Chicago III]]'', another double LP, was released in 1971 and charted at No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name= "Chicago Billboard 200" /> Two singles were released from it: "[[Free (Chicago song)|Free]]" from Lamm's "Travel Suite", which charted at No. 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]];<ref name= BBChicagoHot100 /> and "[[Lowdown (Chicago song)|Lowdown]]", written by Cetera and Seraphine, which made it to No. 35.<ref name= BBChicagoHot100 /> The album was certified gold by the RIAA in February 1971, and platinum in November 1986.<ref name="RIAA Gold & Platinum" />

The band released LPs at a rate of at least one album per year from their third album in 1971 on through the 1970s. During this period, the group's album titles primarily consisted of the band's name followed by a [[Roman numeral]], indicating the album's sequence in their canon. The exceptions to this scheme were the band's fourth album, a live [[box set|boxed set]] entitled ''[[Chicago at Carnegie Hall]]'', their twelfth album ''[[Hot Streets]]'', and the [[Arabic numeral|Arabic-numbered]] ''[[Chicago 13]]''. While the live album itself did not bear a number, the four discs within the set were numbered Volumes I through IV.

In 1971, the band released ''[[Chicago at Carnegie Hall]] Volumes I, II, III, and IV'', a quadruple LP, consisting of live performances, mostly of music from their first three albums, from a week-long run at [[Carnegie Hall]]. Chicago was the first rock act to sell out a week at Carnegie Hall and the live recording was made to chronicle that milestone.<ref name= Ruhlmannp5 /> Along with the four vinyl discs, the packaging contained some strident political messaging about how "We [youth] can change the System", including wall posters and voter registration information.<ref>{{cite news |title=the akron |newspaper=Los Angeles Times  |date=November 6, 1971 |page=6(Part 1)(advertisement) |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14076637/the_los_angeles_times/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=September 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929232016/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14076637/the_los_angeles_times/ |archive-date=September 29, 2017 |url-status=live  }}{{free access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Mendoza |first=Henry |title='Chicago at Carnegie Hall' Called Superb |newspaper=The San Bernardino County Sun |date=November 9, 1971 |page=A-13 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14078340/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/ |access-date=September 29, 2017 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929231940/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14078340/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/ |archive-date=September 29, 2017 |url-status=live  }}{{free access}}</ref> The album went gold "out of the box" and on to multi-platinum status.<ref name= Ruhlmannp5 /> William James Ruhlmann says ''Chicago at Carnegie Hall'' was "perhaps" the best-selling box set by a rock act and held that record for 15 years.<ref name= Ruhlmannp5 /> In recognition of setting Carnegie Hall records and the ensuing four-LP live recordings, the group was awarded a ''Billboard'' 1972 Trendsetter Award.<ref name="Trendsetter Award">{{cite magazine|date=December 25, 1971|title=Talent in Action: Billboard 1972 Trendsetter Awards|magazine=Billboard|location=New York, NY|publisher=Billboard Publications, Inc.|volume=83|number=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA52|page=TA-4, TA-20|via=Google Books|access-date=October 20, 2017|archive-date=February 26, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230226055453/https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA52|url-status=live}}</ref> Drummer Danny Seraphine attributes the fact that none of Chicago's first four albums were issued on single LPs to the productive creativity of this period and the length of the jazz-rock pieces.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Seraphine |first=Danny |subject-link=Danny Seraphine |interviewer=Tom Schulte |title=Danny Seraphine on Outsight Radio Hours |url=https://archive.org/download/SeraphineDannyOnORH |format=audio |publisher=Archive.org |date=September 22, 2013 |time=12:11 |access-date=November 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190320024210/https://archive.org/download/SeraphineDannyOnORH |archive-date=March 20, 2019 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Other albums and singles followed in each of the succeeding years. 1973's ''[[Chicago VI]]'' was the first of several albums to include Brazilian jazz percussionist [[Laudir de Oliveira]]<ref name=Ruhlmannp7/> and saw Cetera emerge as the main lead singer. According to William James Ruhlmann, de Oliveira was a "sideman" on ''Chicago VI'' and became an official member of the group in 1974.<ref name=Ruhlmannp7/> ''Chicago VI'' featured two top ten singles,<ref name="BBChicagoHot100" /> "[[Just You 'n' Me]]", written by Pankow, and "[[Feelin' Stronger Every Day]]", written by Pankow and Cetera. ''[[Chicago VII]]'' was the band's double-disc 1974 release. Three singles were released from this album: "[[(I've Been) Searchin' So Long]]", written by Pankow, and "[[Call on Me (Chicago song)|Call On Me]]", written by Loughnane, which both made it into the top ten;<ref name="BBChicagoHot100" /> and [[the Beach Boys]]-infused "[[Wishing You Were Here]]", written by Cetera, which peaked at number eleven.<ref name="BBChicagoHot100" /> 

Writing for ''Billboard'' magazine, [[Joel Whitburn]] reported in October 1974 that the group had seven albums, its entire catalog at the time, on the ''Billboard'' 200 simultaneously, placing them seventh in a list of artists in that category.<ref name=Whitburn /> Their 1975 release, ''[[Chicago VIII]]'', featured the political allegory "[[Harry Truman (song)|Harry Truman]]" (No. 13, Top 100 chart) and the nostalgic Pankow-composed "[[Old Days]]" (No. 5, Top 100 chart).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://weeklytop40.wordpress.com/1975-all-charts/|title=1975: all charts|website=Weekly Top 40|date=December 31, 1975 |publisher=Eagle Media/JTMichaelson|access-date=January 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308192720/https://weeklytop40.wordpress.com/1975-all-charts/|archive-date=March 8, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitsofalldecades.com/chart_hits/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2156&Itemid=52|title=Billboard Magazine (USA) Weekly Single Charts From 1975|website=Hits of All Decades|publisher=Designs with Hope|access-date=January 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207045915/http://hitsofalldecades.com/chart_hits/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2156&Itemid=52|archive-date=February 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> That summer also saw a joint tour across America with the Beach Boys,<ref name=Ruhlmannp7>{{cite AV media notes|title=Chicago Group Portrait (Box Set)|year=1991|url=http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_7.html|page=7|access-date=January 29, 2016|first=William James|last=Ruhlmann|format=CD booklet archived online|publisher=Columbia Records|location=New York City, NY|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213222057/http://aln3.albumlinernotes.com/Chicago_Box_Set_-_Page_7.html|archive-date=February 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> with the two acts performing separately, then coming together for a finale.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/14/archives/chicago-and-the-beach-boys-combined.html|title=Chicago and the Beach Boys, Combined|last=Rockwell|first=John|date=June 14, 1975|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=August 23, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824052149/http://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/14/archives/chicago-and-the-beach-boys-combined.html|archive-date=August 24, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Chicago VI'', ''VII'', and ''VIII'' all made it to No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name="Chicago Billboard 200" /> all were certified gold the years they were released, and all have since been certified platinum.

Besides recording and touring, during the busy 1970s, Chicago also made time for a movie appearance and several television appearances of note. In 1972, Guercio produced and directed ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'', a film about an [[Arizona]] motorcycle policeman.

After auditioning over 30 potential replacements for Kath, Chicago decided upon guitarist and singer-songwriter [[Donnie Dacus]].<ref name=People1978 /><ref name= Ruhlmannp8 /> While filming for the musical ''[[Hair (movie)|Hair]]'', he joined the band in April 1978 just in time to record the ''[[Hot Streets]]'' album.<ref name=People1978 /> Its energetic lead-off single, "[[Alive Again (Chicago song)|Alive Again]]", brought Chicago back to the Top 15;<ref name=BBChicagoHot100 /> Pankow wrote it "originally as a love song but ultimately as recognition of Kath's guiding spirit shining down from above".<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Box |title-link=The Box (Chicago album) |author=Chicago |year=2003 |publisher=[[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]]}}</ref>

By 1985, the band was embracing the newest medium, the music video channel [[MTV]], by releasing music videos for four songs.

==== Peter Cetera departure and continued success ====
Concurrently with Chicago's existing career, vocalist Peter Cetera had begun a solo career. He proposed an arrangement with the band where they would take hiatuses after tours to let him focus on solo work (mirroring that of [[Phil Collins]] and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]), but the band declined.

In a 2021 interview published in ''[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]'', Robert Lamm asserts that Chicago is and always has been a progressive rock band and that they were particularly influenced by [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[King Crimson]] to write and record their lengthier tracks.

=== Songwriting ===
James Pankow has described the group's songwriting process as "organic", where one person comes up with a song and the other members come up with ideas for their parts.

=== Horn section ===
According to the ''[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]'', Chicago's horn section was "the foundation of the sound that launched the band to stardom in the 1970s."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Holtzclaw |first=Mike |date=September 25, 2014 |title=Chicago is still blowing its own horns |url=https://www.dailypress.com/entertainment/music/dp-fea-chicago-0926-20140925-story.html |access-date=April 24, 2023 |website=Daily Press |archive-date=April 24, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230424165556/https://www.dailypress.com/entertainment/music/dp-fea-chicago-0926-20140925-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Horns arranger James Pankow, speaking in 2017, said that when the band was being formed, they discussed how to make the horns a "main character in a song". He said the horns are a big part of the band's "signature" and that he "took a melodic lead-voice approach to our horns, where the horn section becomes another lead vocal and interweaves in and around the actual vocals and becomes a part of the story of the song."<ref name=":8" /> In a separate interview that same year, Lee Loughnane echoed Pankow's remarks.<ref name=":9" />

== Philanthropy ==
Chicago has supported numerous charitable causes throughout the years.

In the 2010s the group had an ongoing partnership with the American Cancer Society. Fans were given the opportunity to bid to sing their song "If You Leave Me Now" with them on stage during their live performances.

The logo would serve as the band's chief visual icon from ''[[Chicago (album)|Chicago II]]'' onward. In various artistic forms and visual similes, it has been the subject of every subsequent album cover, except the fifteenth album, ''[[Greatest Hits, Volume II (Chicago album)|Greatest Hits, Volume II]]''. For example, it appeared as an American flag on ''[[Chicago III|III]]'', a piece of wood on ''[[Chicago V|V]]'', a [[U.S. currency|U.S. dollar bill]] on ''[[Chicago VI|VI]]'', a leather relief on ''[[Chicago VII|VII]]'', an embroidered patch on ''[[Chicago VIII|VIII]]'', a chocolate bar on ''[[Chicago X|X]]'', a map on ''[[Chicago XI|XI]]'', a building on ''[[Chicago 13|13]]'', a fingerprint on ''[[Chicago XIV|XIV]]'', a computer silicon chip on ''[[Chicago 16|16]]'', a parcel on ''[[Chicago 17|17]]'', a mosaic on ''[[Chicago 18|18]]'', and an [[Watercolor painting|aquarelle]] on ''[[Chicago 19|19]]''. [[Chicago IX: Chicago's Greatest Hits|''Chicago IX'']]'s incarnation was a caricature of the band itself, in the shape of the logo.

The album cover series has endured as a cataloged work of art in its own right, described by Paul Nini of the [[AIGA|American Institute of Graphic Arts]] as a "real landmark in record cover design".<ref name="Interview with John Berg at AIGA"/> In 2013, the iconic status of Chicago's album art was featured in a [[East Hampton (town), New York|New York]] art museum exhibit, which centered upon ninety-five album covers completely selected from John Berg's career portfolio of hundreds. Having overseen the design of approximately fourteen Chicago album covers across more than twenty years, Berg stated that this artistic success resulted from the combination of Chicago's "unique situation" and his position in "the best possible job at the best possible time to have that job, at the center of the graphic universe".<ref name="Album Covers That Are as Evocative as the Music"/> Berg won the 1976 [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Grammy Award for Best Album Package]] for ''Chicago X'', one of four Grammy Awards he won in his lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22John+Berg%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All|title=Grammy Winners Database|access-date=January 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130193541/https://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22John+Berg%22&field_nominee_work_value=&year=All&genre=All|archive-date=January 30, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The book titled ''Type and Image: The Language of Graphic Design'' described the logo as "a warm vernacular form, executed in thick script letters with Victorian swashes in the tradition of sports teams and orange crate labels". The book mentions the cultural and material background of the city of Chicago as inspiration for the logo; for example, describing the leather embossing of ''[[Chicago VII]]'' as representative of the great fire and the stockades. The author connects the album art to the atmosphere of the band's namesake city, quoting the band's original manager, [[James William Guercio]]: "The printed word can never aspire to document a truly musical experience, so if you must call them something, speak of the city where all save one were born; where all of them were schooled and bred, and where all of this incredible music went down barely noticed; call them CHICAGO."<ref name="Type and Image: The Language of Graphic Design"/>

== Personnel ==
As of July 2018, the three remaining active original members of Chicago are Lamm, Loughnane, and Pankow.<ref name=":2" /> Parazaider has retired from regular touring but is still considered as a band member, and has appeared with the group during certain events.<ref name="TribLive2018"/>

=== Band legal structure ===
The legal hierarchy of the band was illuminated in a July 2022 published interview with Robert Lamm, in which he, Pankow and Loughnane are identified as the "partners" and the rest of the members as "contracted players". According to Lamm, the three partners control what the band does. The decision to record the 2022 album, ''Born for This Moment'', depended largely on the consensus of the three partner members.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Mastropolo |first=Frank |date=July 15, 2022 |title=Robert Lamm on Chicago's New LP 'Born for This Moment' and Tour With Brian Wilson |url=https://medium.com/the-riff/robert-lamm-on-chicagos-new-lp-born-for-this-moment-and-tour-with-brian-wilson-c9fdf2856b6f |access-date=April 16, 2023 |website=The Riff |language=en |archive-date=April 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230416173402/https://medium.com/the-riff/robert-lamm-on-chicagos-new-lp-born-for-this-moment-and-tour-with-brian-wilson-c9fdf2856b6f |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite web |last=Mastropolo |first=Frank |date=July 12, 2022 |title=Chicago Co-Founder Robert Lamm on New Album 'Born For This Moment,' Touring with Brian Wilson and Beyond |url=https://rockcellarmagazine.com/chicago-band-interview-robert-lamm-born-for-this-moment/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220712204927/https://rockcellarmagazine.com/chicago-band-interview-robert-lamm-born-for-this-moment/ |archive-date=July 12, 2022 |access-date=April 17, 2023 |website=rockcellarmagazine.com}}</ref>
