Muse released their debut album, ''[[Showbiz (Muse album)|Showbiz]]'', in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's [[falsetto]] and a melancholic [[alternative rock]] style. Their second album, ''[[Origin of Symmetry]]'' (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and [[Romantic music|romantic classical]] influences and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances.<ref name="iTunes">{{Cite web |url=https://music.apple.com/us/artist/muse/1093360 |title=Muse biography |website=[[iTunes]] |access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref> ''[[Absolution (album)|Absolution]]'' (2003) saw further classical influence, with strings on tracks such as "[[Butterflies and Hurricanes]]", and was the first of seven consecutive [[Lists of UK Albums Chart number ones|UK number-one albums]].

''[[Black Holes and Revelations]]'' (2006) incorporated [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Pop music|pop]] elements, displayed in singles such as "[[Supermassive Black Hole (song)|Supermassive Black Hole]]",<ref name="iTunes" /> and brought Muse wider international success. ''[[The Resistance (album)|The Resistance]]'' (2009) and ''[[The 2nd Law]]'' (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Topping the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], their seventh album, ''[[Drones (Muse album)|Drones]]'' (2015), was a [[concept album]] about [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone warfare]] and returned to a harder rock sound.

==History==

=== 1994–1997: Early years ===
The members of Muse played in separate school bands during their time at [[Teignmouth Community College]] in the early 1990s. Guitarist [[Matt Bellamy]] successfully auditioned for drummer [[Dominic Howard]]'s band, Carnage Mayhem, becoming its singer and songwriter. They renamed the band Gothic Plague. They asked [[Chris Wolstenholme]] – at that time the drummer for Fixed Penalty – to join as bassist; he agreed and took up bass lessons.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Rock |last=Buckley |first=Peter |date=17 November 2003 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=1843531054 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse }}</ref><ref>''International who's who in popular music, Volume 4'' p.37. Routledge, 2002</ref> The band was renamed Rocket Baby Dolls and adopted a [[Gothic rock|goth]]-[[Glam rock|glam]] image. Around this time, they received a £150 grant from [[the Prince's Trust]] for equipment.<ref>Jools Holland interview, 10 October 2018</ref>

In 1994, Rocket Baby Dolls won a local [[battle of the bands]], smashing their equipment in the process.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2016/01/22/rocket-baby-dolls-muse-original-band-name-battle-of-the-bands/ |title=Watch "Rocket Baby Dolls" Later Known As Muse Win Battle of the Bands 1994 |website=feelnumb |date=22 January 2016 |access-date=27 May 2018 |archive-date=29 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210129231729/http://www.feelnumb.com/2016/01/22/rocket-baby-dolls-muse-original-band-name-battle-of-the-bands/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bellamy said, "It was supposed to be a protest, a statement, so, when we actually won, it was a real shock, a massive shock. After that, we started taking ourselves seriously." The band quit their jobs, changed their name to Muse, and moved away from Teignmouth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tastemedia.com/muse/musebiog.html |title=Muse Biography |website=Artists |publisher=Taste Music |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021208040122/http://www.tastemedia.com/muse/musebiog.html |archive-date=8 December 2002}}</ref> The band liked that the new name was short and thought that it looked good on a poster.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8176141/Muse-profile-of-the-band.html |title=Muse: Profile of the Band |website=The Telegraph |date=2 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185130/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8176141/Muse-profile-of-the-band.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |access-date=17 June 2015}}</ref> According to journalist Mark Beaumont, the band wanted the name to reflect "the sense Matt had that he had somehow 'summoned up' this band, the way mediums could summon up inspirational spirits at times of emotional need".<ref>Mark Beaumont (2010).

=== 1998–2002: ''Showbiz'' and ''Origin of Symmetry''===

After a few years building a fanbase, Muse played their first gigs in London and [[Manchester]] supporting [[Skunk Anansie]] on tour. They had a significant meeting with Dennis Smith, the owner of [[Sawmills Studio]], situated in a converted water mill in [[Cornwall]]. He had seen the three boys grow up as he knew their parents, and had a production company with their future manager [[Safta Jaffery]], with whom he had recently started the record label [[Taste Media]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Safta_Jaffery_Interview.html |title=Interview with Safta Jaffery, manager for Muse |publisher=HitQuarters |access-date=3 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420051919/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Safta_Jaffery_Interview.html |archive-date=20 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The meeting led to their first serious recordings and the release of the [[Muse (EP)|''Muse'' EP]] on 11 May 1998 on Sawmills' in-house [[Dangerous Records|Dangerous]] label, produced by Paul Reeve.<ref>Ben Myers (2007). "Muse: Inside the Muscle Museum". p. 58. Random House,</ref> Their second EP, the ''[[Muscle Museum EP]]'', also produced by Reeve, was released on 11 January 1999. It reached number 3 in the indie singles chart and attracted the attention of the radio broadcaster [[Steve Lamacq]] and the magazine ''NME''.<ref>{{citation |last=Beaumont |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Beaumont (journalist) |date=8 October 2008 |title=Out of This World: The Story of Muse |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |page=57 |location=London, England |isbn=978-1847723772 }}</ref>

Later in 1999, Muse performed on the Emerging Artist's stage at [[Woodstock '99]] and signed with Smith and Jaffery. Despite the success of their second EP, British record companies were reluctant to sign Muse. After a trip to New York's CMJ Festival, Nanci Walker, then Sr. Director of A&R at Columbia Records, flew Muse to the US to showcase for Columbia Records' then-Senior Vice-president of A&R, [[Tim Devine]], as well as for American Recording's Rick Rubin. During this trip, on 24 December 1998, Muse signed a deal with American record label Maverick Records.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ticketmaster.ie/artist/944747 |title=Muse biography |website=Ticketmaster |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420013322/http://www.ticketmaster.ie/artist/944747 |archive-date=20 April 2008 |url-status=dead |access-date=2 May 2008 }}</ref> Upon their return to England, Taste Media arranged deals for Muse with various record labels in Europe and Australia, allowing them control over their career in individual countries.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96 |title=''Billboard'' 28 August 1999 |date=28 August 1999 |access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> [[John Leckie]] was brought in alongside Reeve to produce the band's first album, ''[[Showbiz (Muse album)|Showbiz]]'' (1999). The album showcased Muse's aggressive yet melancholic musical style, with lyrics about relationships and their difficulties trying to establish themselves in their hometown.<ref>''Showbiz''. Kerrang Review, 1999</ref>

[[File:Muse at Roskilde Festival 2000.jpg|thumb|left|Muse performing at [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark, July 2000]]
During the production of their second album, ''Origin of Symmetry'' (2001), Muse experimented with instrumentation such as a [[church organ]], [[Mellotron]], animal bones, and an expanded drum kit. There was more of Bellamy's falsetto, [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] guitar, and piano playing. Bellamy cites guitar influences such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Tom Morello]] (of [[Rage Against the Machine]]), the latter evident in the more [[riff]]-based songs in ''Origin of Symmetry'' and in Bellamy's use of guitar [[Pitch shift|pitch-shifting effects]]. The album features a cover of [[Anthony Newley]] and [[Leslie Bricusse]]'s "[[Feeling Good]]",<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.microcuts.net/uk/news/archives/06242003-nme_article.php |title=NME article |work=NME |access-date=19 January 2008 |date=June 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202095535/http://www.microcuts.net/uk/news/archives/06242003-nme_article.php |archive-date=2 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> voted in various polls one of the greatest cover versions of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.totalguitar.co.uk/page/totalguitar?entry=tg_s_best_covers_ever |title=TG's Best Covers EVER! |date=23 June 2008 |magazine=[[Total Guitar]] |access-date=16 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/muse/53090 |title=Muse beat The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash to win best cover song of all time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104211343/http://www.nme.com/news/muse/53090 |archive-date=4 January 2016 |website=NME |date=22 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29791820 |title=Pet Shop Boys' Always On My Mind tops cover version vote |date=27 October 2014 |work=BBC News |access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref> It was released as a [[double A-side]] single, "[[Hyper Music/Feeling Good]]".

''Origin of Symmetry'' received positive reviews. ''NME'' gave it 9/10 and wrote: "It's amazing for such a young band to load up with a heritage that includes the darker visions of [[Kurt Cobain|Cobain]] and [[Kafka]], [[Mahler]] and [[the Tiger Lillies]], [[David Cronenberg|Cronenberg]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], and make a sexy, populist album."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/muse/5220 |title=Origin of Symmetry – Review |last=Morton |first=Roger |website=NME |date=12 September 2005 |access-date=4 May 2008}}</ref> Maverick, Muse's American label, did not consider Bellamy's vocals "radio-friendly" and asked Muse to rerecord "Plug in Baby" for the US release.<ref name="New Music Monthly-2003" /> Muse refused and left Maverick.

On 10 November 2001 the band appeared on BBC's ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'' and performed "[[Hyper Music/Feeling Good|Hyper Music]]" and "[[Feeling Good]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06mdl3j|title=BBC Two - Later... with Jools Holland, Muse - Feeling Good (Later Archive 2001)|date=28 September 2018|website=BBC}}</ref>

In 2002, Muse released the first live DVD, ''[[Hullabaloo Soundtrack#DVD|Hullabaloo]]'', featuring footage recorded during Muse's two gigs at [[Le Zenith]] in Paris in 2001, and a documentary film of the band on tour. A double album, ''Hullabaloo Soundtrack'', was released at the same time, containing a compilation of [[B-side]]s and a disc of recordings of songs from the Le Zenith performances. A double-A side single was also released featuring the new songs "[[In Your World]]" and "[[Dead Star/In Your World|Dead Star]]".

In 2002, Muse threatened [[Celine Dion]] with legal action when she planned to name her Las Vegas show "Muse", as Muse had worldwide performing rights to the name. Muse refused an offer from Dion of $50,000 for the rights, as they feared it could harm their chances of breaking into the US market. Bellamy said: "We don't want to turn up there with people thinking we're Celine Dion's backing band."<ref name="celine">{{cite news |date=18 October 2002 |title=Band muses on Dion name victory |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2339585.stm |access-date=19 January 2008}}</ref>

Early in their career, Muse were often likened to [[Radiohead]].<ref name="Marchese-2009" /> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' wrote that Bellamy's voice "often slips into high, mournful tones" similar to the Radiohead singer, [[Thom Yorke]].<ref name="Marchese-2009" /> [[John Leckie]], who produced Muse's first two albums and also produced Radiohead's second album, ''[[The Bends (album)|The Bends]]'' (1995), dismissed the comparisons, saying: "In the late 90s, any British band that sang passionately and played guitar was going to get compared to Radiohead." He said he chose to produce Muse after ''The Bends'' because he "intentionally looked for something different".<ref name="Marchese-2009" /> Asked in 2009, Bellamy said he did not hear the similarity, saying Muse were "past [the comparisons] in most places".<ref name="Marchese-2009" />

In 2006, ''Pitchfork'' described Muse's music as "firmly ol' skool at heart: proggy hard rock that forgoes any pretensions to restraint ... their songs use full-stacked guitars and thunderous drums to evoke God's footsteps".<ref name="Pitchfork genres" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Muse - Absolution|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/absolution-mw0000384478|website=Allmusic|access-date=4 November 2014}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] described their sound as a "fusion of progressive rock, [[glam rock|glam]], electronica, and Radiohead-influenced experimentation".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p142116/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title = Muse > Biography|work=AllMusic|first=Heather|last=Phares|access-date =31 March 2015}}</ref> On Muse's association with progressive rock, Howard said: "I associate [progressive rock] with 10-minute guitar solos, but I guess we kind of come into the category.

===Lyrics===
Most earlier Muse songs lyrically dealt with introspective themes, including relationships, social alienation, and difficulties they had encountered while trying to establish themselves in their hometown. However, with the band's progress, their song concepts have become more ambitious, addressing issues such as the fear of the evolution of technology in their ''Origin of Symmetry'' (2001) album. They deal mainly with the [[apocalypse]] in ''Absolution'' (2003) and with catastrophic war in ''Black Holes and Revelations'' (2006). ''The Resistance'' (2009) focused on themes of government oppression, uprising, love, and [[panspermia]]. The album was inspired by ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]]. Their sixth studio album, ''The 2nd Law'' (2012), relates to economics, thermodynamics, and apocalyptic themes. Their 2015 album, ''Drones'', is a concept album that uses autonomous killing drones as a metaphor for brainwashing and loss of empathy.{{Cn|date=November 2024}}  The ''Guardian'' wrote that Muse incorporate "calls for revolution just vague enough that both the left and right could rally behind them".<ref name="Mills-2023" />
