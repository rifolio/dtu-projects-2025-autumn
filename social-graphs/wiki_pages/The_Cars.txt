'''The Cars''' were<!-- Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both American English and British English. Please do not change "were" to "was". --> an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Boston]] in 1976. Emerging from the [[New wave music|new wave]] [[Subculture|scene]] in the late 1970s, they consisted of [[Ric Ocasek]] ([[rhythm guitar]]), [[Benjamin Orr]] ([[bass guitar]]), [[Elliot Easton]] ([[lead guitar]]), [[Greg Hawkes]] ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]) and [[David Robinson (drummer)|David Robinson]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]). Ocasek and Orr shared lead vocals, and Ocasek was the band's principal songwriter and leader.  

The Cars were at the forefront of the merger of 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new [[synthesizer]]-oriented pop that became popular in the early 1980s. Music critic [[Robert Palmer (American writer)|Robert Palmer]], writer for ''The New York Times'' and ''Rolling Stone'', described the Cars' musical style: "They have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends—[[Punk rock|punk]] minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of [[art rock]], the '50s [[rockabilly]] revival and the melodious terseness of [[power pop]]—and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend".

The Cars were named Best New Artist in the 1978 ''Rolling Stone'' Readers' Poll. The band's debut album, ''[[The Cars (album)|The Cars]]'', sold six million copies and appeared on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart for 139 weeks. The Cars had four Top 10 hits: "[[Shake It Up (The Cars song)|Shake It Up]]" (1981), "[[You Might Think]]" (1984), "[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]" (1984), and "[[Tonight She Comes]]" (1985). The band won [[MTV Video Music Awards|Video of the Year]] for "[[You Might Think]]" at the first [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]] in 1984.

The Cars disbanded in 1988. In 2007, Easton and Hawkes joined [[Todd Rundgren]] and others to form the offshoot band [[The New Cars]]. The surviving original members of the Cars reunited to record the band's seventh and final album, ''[[Move Like This]]'' (2011) [[The Cars North American Tour Spring 2011|toured]] in support of the album, and once again went on hiatus. In April 2018, the Cars were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The band reunited to perform at the induction ceremony.

==History==
===Early years===
Before forming The Cars, members of the band performed together in several different groups. Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr met in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1960s after Ocasek saw Orr performing with his band the Grasshoppers on ''[[Upbeat (TV series)|The Big 5 Show]]'', a local musical variety program. The two were members of various bands in Columbus, Ohio, and Ann Arbor, Michigan, before moving to Boston in the early 1970s. In Boston, Ocasek and Orr, along with lead guitarist Jas Goodkind, formed a [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills and Nash]]-style folk rock band called Milkwood. In 1972, they released an album titled ''How's the Weather'' through [[Paramount Records (1969)|Paramount Records]] that failed to chart.

After Milkwood, Ocasek and Orr formed the group Richard and the Rabbits, a name suggested by [[Jonathan Richman]]. The band included Greg Hawkes, who had studied at the [[Berklee College of Music|Berklee School of Music]] and had played saxophone on Milkwood's album. Hawkes left to tour with [[Martin Mull|Martin Mull and His Fabulous Furniture]], a musical comedy act in which Mull played a variety of instruments. Ocasek and Orr then performed as an acoustic duo called Ocasek and Orr at the Idler Coffeehouse in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some of the songs they played became early Cars songs.

Ocasek and Orr later teamed with guitarist Elliot Easton (who had also studied at Berklee) in the band Cap'n Swing. The band also featured drummer Glenn Evans, later followed by Kevin Robichaud, and a jazzy bass player, which clashed with Ocasek's preference for a rock-and-roll sound. Orr was the lead vocalist and did not play an instrument. Cap'n Swing soon came to the attention of [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]] disc jockey Maxanne Sartori, who began playing songs from their demo tape on her show.

After being rejected by several record labels, Ocasek fired the bass player, keyboardist and drummer and resolved to form a band better fitting his style of writing. Orr took bass guitar and Robichaud was replaced by [[David Robinson (drummer)|David Robinson]], best known for his career with [[the Modern Lovers]] and [[DMZ (band)|DMZ]]. Robinson, whose sense of fashion exerted a strong influence on the band's image, suggested the band's new name, the Cars. The band was formed in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2017/12/13/the-cars-get-green-light-rock-and-roll-hall-fame/9Zk0z9EUeadRVoqAeN49EL/story.html|title=A brief history of the Cars - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com}}</ref>

===Rise in popularity, ''The Cars'', and ''Candy-O'' (1976–1979)===
After a warmup gig in a motel lounge outside of Boston, the Cars played their official first show at [[Pease Air National Guard Base|Pease Air Force Base]] in New Hampshire a short time later on December 31, 1976.

Cap'n Swing's keyboardist Danny Schliftman (later to join [[Gov't Mule]] under the name Danny Louis) played with the Cars for their first several gigs until Greg Hawkes was free to join in February 1977.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://sweetpurplejune.wordpress.com/category/capn-swing/ | title=Cap'n Swing | date=January 18, 2021 }}</ref>

The Cars spent early 1977 playing throughout New England, developing the songs that appeared on their debut album. A nine-song demo tape was recorded in early 1977 and soon "[[Just What I Needed]]" was receiving heavy airplay on Boston radio stations WBCN and [[WJMN (FM)|WCOZ]].<ref>Carter Alan. ''Radio Free Boston: The Rise and Fall of WBCN''. {{ISBN|978-1-55553-729-6}}. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2013, p. 109.</ref> The band was offered record deals by [[Arista Records]] and [[Elektra Records]] and finally signed with famed [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive [[George Daly (music executive)|George Daly]] to Elektra-Asylum, a label with comparatively fewer new-wave acts.<ref name="Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology">{{cite book|last1=Milano|first1=Brett|title=Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology|publisher=Rhino}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Cashbox Newspaper, September 23, 1978, page 52. |url=https://archive.org/details/cb-1978-09-23-page-52}}</ref> The band's debut album ''[[The Cars (album)|The Cars]]'' was released in June 1978, reaching No.18 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/|title=Billboard 200|first=Rosalie|last=Cabison|website=Billboard.com|date=January 2, 2013|access-date=June 9, 2022}}</ref> "Just What I Needed" was released as the debut single from the album, followed by "[[My Best Friend's Girl (song)|My Best Friend's Girl]]" and "[[Good Times Roll]]", all three charting on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album featured multiple album tracks that received substantial airplay such as "[[You're All I've Got Tonight]]", "[[Bye Bye Love (The Cars song)|Bye Bye Love]]" and "[[Moving in Stereo]]".

The band's second album, ''[[Candy-O]]'', was released in June 1979 and eclipsed the success of ''The Cars'', peaking at No. 3 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' album chart, 15 spots higher than the debut album. Featuring a cover created by the famed ''[[Playboy]]'' artist [[Alberto Vargas]], the album featured the band's first top-20 single "[[Let's Go (The Cars song)|Let's Go]]". Singles "[[It's All I Can Do]]" and "[[Double Life (The Cars song)|Double Life]]" were also released, but with less success.

===Change in sound, ''Panorama'' and ''Shake It Up'' (1980–1983)===
Following the success of ''Candy-O'', the band's third studio album ''[[Panorama (The Cars album)|Panorama]]'' was released in August 1980. The album was considered more experimental than its predecessors and featured only one top-40 hit, "[[Touch and Go (The Cars song)|Touch and Go]]". Although the album peaked at No. 5 in the U.S., it did not receive the critical praise of ''The Cars'' and ''Candy-O'', with ''Rolling Stone'' describing the album as "an out-and-out drag."

In 1981 the Cars purchased Intermedia Studios in Boston, renaming it [[Syncro Sound]].<ref>Morse, Steve. "Boston's Music Scene: A Hotbed of Rock and Roll" ''Boston Globe'' June 5, 1981</ref> The only Cars album recorded there was the band's fourth album ''[[Shake It Up (The Cars album)|Shake It Up]]'', a more commercial album than ''Panorama''. It was the band's first album to spawn a top-10 single with [[Shake It Up (The Cars song)|the title track]], and it included another hit in "[[Since You're Gone]]".

Following their 1982 tour, the Cars took a two-year break and the members worked on solo projects, with Ocasek and Hawkes both releasing debut albums (''[[Beatitude (album)|Beatitude]]'' and ''[[Niagara Falls (Greg Hawkes album)|Niagara Falls]]'', respectively).

===''Heartbeat City'', ''Door to Door'', superstardom, and first hiatus (1984–1988)===

}}

The Cars reunited and released their most successful album, ''[[Heartbeat City]]'', in 1984. The first single, "[[You Might Think]]", helped the Cars win [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the first [[MTV Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]]. Other hit singles from the album included "[[Magic (The Cars song)|Magic]]", "[[Hello Again (The Cars song)|Hello Again]]" and "[[Why Can't I Have You]]". "[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]", with Orr on lead vocals, gained notoriety when it was used in a video about the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|Ethiopian famine]] shown at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley Stadium]] in London,<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book|first=Martin C.|last=Strong|year=2000|title=The Great Rock Discography|edition=5th|publisher=Mojo Books|location=Edinburgh|pages=154–155|isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref> although the Cars performed at the Live Aid concert in Philadelphia. The song became the band's most successful single, reaching No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Actor/director [[Timothy Hutton]] directed the song's music video.

The band's 1985 ''[[Greatest Hits (The Cars album)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation included another hit single, "[[Tonight She Comes]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;7 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Top Rock Tracks]] chart. In 1987, the Cars released their sixth album, ''[[Door to Door (album)|Door to Door]]''. It contained their last major international hit "[[You Are the Girl]]", but the album failed to approach the success of their previous albums. The group announced their breakup in February 1988.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/><ref>"Life after The Cars" ''The Cincinnati Post'' October 11, 1997: 16A</ref>

In 2010, the surviving founding members of the Cars suggested a reunion when Ocasek, Easton, Hawkes and Robinson placed a photo of the four members together, taken at Millbrook Sound Studios, on their Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=11446_The_Cars_Hint_At_Reformation_On_Facebook |title=Photo |publisher=Undercover.com.au |date=July 25, 2010 |access-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922053410/http://www.undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=11446_The_Cars_Hint_At_Reformation_On_Facebook |archive-date=September 22, 2010  }}</ref> On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song titled "[[Blue Tip]]".

In October, ''Billboard'' reported that the Cars were recording a new album at veteran engineer Paul Orofino's studio in Millbrook, New York. A music clip of the new song "[[Sad Song (The Cars song)|Sad Song]]" was added to the band's Facebook page on December 7, 2010. A clip of a song titled "Free" was shared on January 1, 2011. The official debut video for "Blue Tip" was released on February 17. The video features the members of the band and New York-based street artist Joe Iurato. The surviving Cars agreed to not replace Orr, so Hawkes and Lee handled all of the bass parts.<ref name="RollingStone-Reunion"/>

On the tour, Orr's bass parts were performed by Hawkes on keyboard and bass, and the vocals for songs originally sung by Orr ("Just What I Needed", "Let's Go" and "Moving in Stereo") were performed by Ocasek. In an interview, Ocasek was asked whether the band would have reunited if Orr had still been alive, responding: "Ben and I had a real cold war going that lasted about 23 years. I could never really figure out exactly why, but I think there was a lot of jealousy because I wrote the songs and I got a lot of attention.
