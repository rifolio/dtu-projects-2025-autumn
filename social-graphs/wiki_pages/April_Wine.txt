'''April Wine''' is a Canadian rock band formed in 1969 and based in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], led by singer-guitarist-songwriter [[Myles Goodwyn]] until his death in 2023. April Wine first experienced success with their second album, ''[[On Record (album)|On Record]]'' (1972), which reached the Top 40 in the Canadian album chart and yielded two hit singles: a cover of [[Elton John]]'s "Bad Side of the Moon", a top 20 hit in Canada; and a cover of [[Hot Chocolate]]'s "[[You Could Have Been a Lady]]", a number 2 song in Canada.<ref name=RPMSingles>{{cite magazine |title=RPM Singles Charts: April Wine |date=September 27, 2015 |magazine=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |via=[[Collections Canada]] |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=m4vlo99ae8aupajm3k3hgogv63&q1=April+Wine&q2=Top+Singles&interval=20 |access-date=April 26, 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927174913/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-110.01-e.php?PHPSESSID=m4vlo99ae8aupajm3k3hgogv63&q1=April+Wine&q2=Top+Singles&interval=20 |archive-date=September 27, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

They have experienced only moderate international success, but great popularity in their home country of Canada, reaching the Top 40 singles charts with 21 different songs. Their greatest response internationally throughout the 1970s and early '80s came with songs such as, "You Could Have Been a Lady" (1972), "[[Tonite Is a Wonderful Time to Fall in Love]]" (1975), "[[Roller (April Wine song)|Roller]]" (1979), "[[I Like to Rock (song)|I Like to Rock]]" (1980), "[[Sign of the Gypsy Queen]]" (1981), and "[[Just Between You and Me (April Wine song)|Just Between You and Me]]" (1981).

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Although April Wine officially began in late 1969 in [[Waverley, Nova Scotia]], their roots can be traced to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, in 1967/68, where brothers David and Ritchie Henman grew up playing music together before moving to Nova Scotia.<ref name="encyclopop">{{cite web |title=CANOE – JAM! Music – Pop Encyclopedia |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/A/April_Wine.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525025235/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/A/April_Wine.html |url-status=usurped |archive-date=May 25, 2012 |publisher=Jam.canoe.ca |access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Notable Entertainment and Events – Headline Acts |url=http://www.noteable.net/HeadlineActs/AprilWine.html |publisher=Noteable.net |access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref>

Three of the founding members&nbsp;-&nbsp;David Henman (guitar), Ritchie Henman (drums), and their cousin Jim Henman (bass)&nbsp;-&nbsp;were originally in a band named Prism (not to be confused with [[Prism (band)|the Vancouver-based band of the same name]]). After a brief break to attend university, the trio reformed with [[Myles Goodwyn]] on lead vocals and guitar. Goodwyn had previously played with Jim Henman in a group called the Termites. David Henman christened the new group "April Wine". They realized that [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] did not provide opportunities to play and record, so they sent a demo tape to [[Aquarius Records (Canada)|Aquarius Records]] in Montreal. Aquarius managers Terry Flood and [[Donald K. Tarlton]] returned a rejection letter but the band mistook it for an invitation. On April 1, 1970, April Wine went to [[Montreal]], bringing with them their instruments and $100 in cash; Flood and Tarlton were persuaded to sign the band to a contract.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mersereau |first1=Bob |title=Great Moments In Canadian Music, Dec 2021 |url=https://amplify.nmc.ca/great-moments-in-canadian-music-track-13-how-april-wine-turned-a-rejection-letter-into-their-big-break/ |website=amplify.nmc.ca |date=December 9, 2021 |publisher=Amplify, National Music Centre |access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref> They were set up in a chalet and booked at a local comedy club, Café André.

The band recorded and released their self-titled debut album ''[[April Wine (album)|April Wine]]'' in September 1971.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Doug |title=April Wine Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/april-wine-mw0000524650 |website=allmusic.com |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Making music : profiles from a century of Canadian music|last=Barris, Alex.|date=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|others=Barris, Theodore.|isbn=0-00-200056-3|edition=1st|location=Toronto|oclc=46629111}}</ref> The album included a single, "[[Fast Train (song)|Fast Train]]", which was a top 40 hit in Canada and peaked at No. 38 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Singles Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.5365&volume=15&issue=21&issue_dt=July%2010%201971&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=poh911qgn3os6sru15ijbeam42|title=Item Display – RPM – Library and Archives Canada|website=Weba.rchive.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012224314/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.5365&volume=15&issue=21&issue_dt=July%2010%201971&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=poh911qgn3os6sru15ijbeam42|access-date=August 13, 2021|archive-date=October 12, 2012}}</ref>The album did not sell well, but the success of the single led the band's label to ask for a second album. Jim Henman left the band in the fall of 1971 and was replaced by [[Jim Clench]].<ref name="TheStar" /> In the meantime, the band spent 1971 touring the college circuit, with the exception of July 30th, when they opened at Montreal's Place des Nations for [[The Guess Who]]. 1972 was much the same, although they began to play larger venues and opened for a few more large acts, like [[Ike & Tina Turner]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Badfinger]] and [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref name="APRIL WINE CONCERT DATE ARCHIVE"/>

=== Mainstream success ===
Under the guidance of producer [[Ralph Murphy (musician)|Ralph Murphy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/nashville/murphy/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916194112/http://www.ascap.com/nashville/murphy/|archive-date=September 16, 2008|title=Murphy's Laws of Songwriting – Advice from ASCAP Nashville's Ralph Murphy|access-date=October 11, 2008|publisher=ASCAP.com}}</ref> April Wine recorded their second album, ''[[On Record (album)|On Record]]'' in 1972. The first single was a cover version of the [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]] song "You Could Have Been a Lady". The record was a commercial success, hitting number two for a single week on the RPM Canadian charts, as well as cracking the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the [[United States]] where it stayed for 11 weeks, peaking at No. 32.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_index.jsp |title=For all Billboard chart rankings |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=May 29, 2012 |archive-date=September 3, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903144110/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_index.jsp |url-status=dead }}</ref> A second single, a cover of "Bad Side of the Moon" by [[Elton John]] and [[Bernie Taupin]], also got much airplay on Canadian radio and was a minor hit in the U.S. Both tracks remain staples on [[classic rock]] radio stations in Canada. ''On Record'' was certified Gold in Canada and the band, along with Murphy, returned to the studio.

While the band was recording their third album in 1973, David and Ritchie Henman quit. Goodwyn and Clench held auditions and the replacements were drummer [[Jerry Mercer]] (formerly of [[Mashmakhan]]) and guitarist Gary Moffet. They finished the album,  ''[[Electric Jewels]]'', with the songs "Weeping Widow," "Just Like That" and "Lady Run, Lady Hide", which would stay in April Wine's set lists for many years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ronald |first1=Brian |title=APRIL WINE – Electric Jewels, June 2017 |url=https://www.decibelgeek.com/april-wine-electric-jewels-70s-guy-retro-review/ |website=decibelgeek.com |date=June 21, 2017 |publisher=Decibel Geek |access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref> In support of this album, the band embarked on the Electric Adventure Tour where nearly every Canadian arena or concert hall that seated more than 2500 saw the band play.<ref name=":0" /> The tour also featured a massive lighting and pyrotechnic show.<ref name="Inc.1974">{{cite magazine|author=Martin Melhuish|date=October 12, 1974|title=From the Music Capitals of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA47|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=47–|issn=0006-2510|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> Touring proved successful; [[Gene Cornish]] and [[Dino Danelli]] of [[The Rascals]] attended a 1974 concert in [[Massey Hall]], and were so impressed they offered to record and produce a live album of the band. The one-night recording session was something of a rushed enterprise; they wanted the album to be released by the end of the tour. Goodwyn wasn't happy with the sound, but ''April Wine Live'' went [[Music recording certification|gold]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Gold and platinum years ===
The band's fifth release, 1975's ''[[Stand Back (April Wine album)|Stand Back]]'', went double platinum in Canada, riding on the success of the singles "Tonight Is A Wonderful Time To Fall In Love" and "I Wouldn't Want To Lose Your Love".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gp/database/search_results.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128200539/http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/search_results.asp|url-status=dead|title=For all Gold & Platinum certification of albums at RIAA|website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |archive-date=November 28, 2006|access-date=August 13, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Inc.1974" /> April Wine went on tour with [[Heart (band)|Heart]], then [[Thundermug (band)|Thundermug]].<ref name="APRIL WINE CONCERT DATE ARCHIVE"/> In April 1976, April Wine became the first band to sell out [[Regina Stadium]] and the first band to sell out [[Edmonton]]'s [[Kinsmen Field House]] two nights in a row.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=A Platinum LP, $million tour vintage Wine|magazine=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RPM-IDX/IDX/70s/RPM-1976-05-08-OCR-Page-0009.pdf|date=May 8, 1976}}</ref> Following the tour, Jim Clench left, eventually to join [[Bachman–Turner Overdrive]] (in 1977);<ref name="thestar" /> he was replaced by [[Steve Lang]].

The band's next release, in 1976, was ''[[The Whole World's Goin' Crazy]]''. It was the first April Wine release to hit platinum status based on advanced sales orders alone.<ref name="leaderpost">{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/letters/story.html?id=c30cd4e9-cfb4-4463-b2f5-50b15393fb49|title=Famous band unrecognised – The Leader-Post (Regina)|access-date=April 17, 2009|publisher=Canada.com|archive-date=March 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314153614/http://www2.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/letters/story.html?id=c30cd4e9-cfb4-4463-b2f5-50b15393fb49|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album contained the popular title track as well as a hit single, the ballad "Like A Lover, Like A Song". Their sixth album, ''[[Forever for Now (April Wine album)|Forever for Now]]'', was another platinum seller and contained the band's biggest single to date, "You Won't Dance With Me".<ref name="Inc.1976">{{cite magazine|author=Martin Melhuish|title=Striving for Success without Leaning on Government|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT60|date=October 2, 1976|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=60–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

On March 4 & 5, 1977, April Wine was booked to play a charity concert at Toronto's famed [[El Mocambo]] Club. The co-headliner on the bill was a band called "The Cockroaches", which turned out to be [[The Rolling Stones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/A/April_Wine/2010/04/15/13597291.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712214121/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/A/April_Wine/2010/04/15/13597291.html|url-status=usurped|archive-date=July 12, 2012|title=Canoe JAM! - April Wine singer savours Juno love |access-date=March 23, 2009|publisher=Jam.Canoe.ca}}</ref> The pseudonym was a poorly kept secret and huge crowds turned out for the event. April Wine's performance was captured and released as the album ''[[Live at the El Mocambo (April Wine album)|Live at the El Mocambo]]''. The band then got its first chance at touring the U.S., opening for The Rolling Stones, [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].

Also in 1977, [[Brian Greenway]], late of [[The Dudes (1970s band)|The Dudes]] (the Henmans' new band) was brought in as a third guitarist and co-vocalist. His addition gave April Wine a powerful three guitar attack that would make their hard rock sound. This also allowed Goodwyn to switch to keyboards for ballads. They also signed to Capitol Records (in addition to Aquarius).<ref>{{cite web |title=April Wine |url=https://www.canadianbands.com/April%20Wine.html |website=canadianbands.com |publisher=Canadian Bands |access-date=30 January 2022 |archive-date=December 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211209041915/http://canadianbands.com/April%20Wine.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

1978 saw continued Canadian success, and the beginning of international success. The band's seventh album, and the first with Capitol, was ''[[First Glance]]'', which had an immediate impact and the singles "Let Yourself Go" and "Get Ready For Love" were successful on Canadian radio.<ref>{{cite web |title=April Wine – First Glance, Apr 2021 |url=https://outsiderrock.ca/2021/04/08/april-wine-first-glance/ |website=outsiderrock.ca |date=April 9, 2021 |publisher=Outsider Rock |access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref> It was the third single, the raucous "Roller", that brought the band mass appeal across North America—it stayed on the Billboard Hot 100 for eleven weeks. ''First Glance'' stayed on the Billboard album chart for many weeks, making it April Wine's first gold record outside of Canada. Constant touring helped propel the band to greater success, as Americans embraced the hard rock of this "new" band from Canada—in 1978, they toured with Rush and played with [[Triumph (band)|Triumph]], [[Starcastle]], and [[Teaze]] and, in July, played a concert with the Rolling Stones, [[Journey (band)|Journey]], and the [[Atlanta Rhythm Section]].<ref name="APRIL WINE CONCERT DATE ARCHIVE"/>

Following on the popularity of ''First Glance'', April Wine released ''[[Harder ... Faster]]'' in 1979.  "Say Hello" and "I Like to Rock" were popular hits on both sides of the border and ''Harder ... Faster'' proved to be yet another multi-platinum release for the band.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Aaron |first1=S.

In 1979, the [[BBC]] released ''In Concert'' for international distribution; in 1981, Aquarius released another compilation album, ''The Best of April Wine Rock Ballads''.

=== 1980s ===

On 16th August 1980 the band performed at the inaugural [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in [[Castle Donington]], England.

''[[The Nature of the Beast (album)|The Nature of the Beast]]''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stoney Cannon |first1=John |title=April Wine: 'The Nature of The Beast', Jan 2021 |url=https://sleazeroxx.com/reviews/april-wine-the-nature-of-the-beast/ |website=sleazeroxx.com |date=January 12, 2021 |publisher=Sleaze Roxx |access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref> was released in January 1981, and riding on the popularity of the hit singles "[[Just Between You and Me (April Wine song)|Just Between You and Me]]" and the band's cover of the Lorence Hud song "Sign of the Gypsy Queen", the album hit multi-platinum success in Canada, and was the first April Wine album to reach platinum status internationally. April Wine embarked on an extensive support tour, performing to their largest crowds ever. In addition to a packed schedule of solo concerts, they toured with [[Diamond Head (English band)|Diamond Head]], [[Harlequin (band)|Harlequin]], [[Krokus (band)|Krokus]] and [[Franke and the Knockouts]], played five concerts with [[Loverboy]], and travelled to Germany to play a concert with [[Neil Young]], Jethro Tull, the [[Michael Schenker Group]] (MSG), and [[King Crimson]].<ref name="APRIL WINE CONCERT DATE ARCHIVE"/> The band then went on an eighteen-month hiatus.

In July 1982 April Wine released their tenth studio album, ''[[Power Play (April Wine album)|Power Play]]''. The album included the singles "Enough is Enough", "If You See Kay" and "Anything You Want, You Got It". The latter would become the band's opening number on the supporting tour, while the "Enough is Enough" video<ref>{{cite web |title=April Wine - Enough Is Enough |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHCO22TedRQ |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube |access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref> started receiving frequent rotation on [[MTV]]. Despite decent sales, ''Power Play'' was not met with the same critical acclaim the prior two albums had received; both the album and its singles charted well on Billboard's lists, but for shorter periods of time than earlier albums and singles. Still, it was certified gold, and then platinum, in October.<ref>{{cite web |title=April Wine Power Play CRIA Gold Album Award |url=https://www.barnebys.com/auctions/lot/april-wine-power-play-cria-gold-album-award-aHJzRg2b1b |website=barnebys.com |publisher=Barnebys |access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=April Wine Power Play Platinum Award |url=https://musicgoldmine.com/products/april-wine-power-play-cria-platinum-album-award |website=musicgoldmine.com |publisher=Music Goldmine |access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref> The ''Power Play'' tour in 1982 was the band's most extensive—three months, with [[Saga (band)|Saga]], [[Eddie Money]] and [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]].<ref name="APRIL WINE CONCERT DATE ARCHIVE"/> The New York concerts with Saga and Money resulted in separate ''Live From Central Park'' albums.

The band started writing and recording their next album, ''[[Animal Grace]]'', but the members were not getting along, and Myles Goodwyn moved from Canada to the [[Bahamas]]. Both ''Animal Grace'' and its single "This Could be the Right One" rose quickly on the charts, but stayed only for a short time. In 1984 the band got together for its announced "Farewell Tour", which was a month-long tour across Canada.<ref name="APRIL WINE CONCERT DATE ARCHIVE"/>
The tour was successful enough to spawn another live album, ''[[One for the Road (April Wine album)|One for the Road]]''.

April Wine still owed Capitol Records one more album. So Greenway joined Goodwyn in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], along with Montreal session musicians Daniel Barbe (keyboards), Jean Pellerin (bass) and drummer [[Marty Simon]], to record what was supposed to be the band's final album, ''[[Walking Through Fire]]''. It was released in September 1985 under the April Wine name.

=== Rebirth ===

In 1988 Goodwyn moved back to Canada. Although there was interest in an April Wine reunion, and the subject was discussed among the former members, other commitments prevented them from getting together until 1992. April Wine returned to the stage that year, starting with a free concert in [[Portage la Prairie, Manitoba]]. The reunited band consisted of Goodwyn, Greenway, returning drummer Jerry Mercer and bassist Jim Clench, who hadn't played with the band since 1975. Filling out the act was third guitarist Steve Segal. The band toured in both Canada and the US. In 1993, now with Flood Ross Entertainment, they released the first "true" April Wine album in a decade, ''[[Attitude (April Wine album)|Attitude]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Attitude, Customer Reviews |url=https://www.amazon.ca/Attitude-April-Wine/dp/B00005YACN |website=amazon.ca |publisher=Amazon |access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref> It was certified gold in Canada soon after its release. Segal remained with the band through one more studio release, 1994's ''[[Frigate (album)|Frigate]]''. Each year, for the next five years, they went out on tour, playing with, among others, [[Def Leppard]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Meat Loaf]], Loverboy, [[Peter Frampton]], Blue Öyster Cult and [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]].<ref name="APRIL WINE CONCERT DATE ARCHIVE"/>

The band released another album in 2001, entitled ''[[Back to the Mansion]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sterdan |first1=Darryl |title=Classic Album Review: April Wine Back to the Mansion, June 2021 |url=https://tinnitist.com/2021/06/01/classic-album-review-april-wine-back-to-the-mansion/ |website=tinnitist.com |date=June 2021 |publisher=Tinnitist |access-date=30 January 2022}}</ref> Also in 2001, the band's song "Roller" was featured in the movie ''[[Joe Dirt]]''. Then in 2003, they released the live album called ''[[Greatest Hits Live 2003]]''. In the meantime, various labels released several compilation albums.

In 2004 Silverline released April Wine's first [[DVD-Audio|DVD-A]] called ''[[From the Front Row ... Live!]]''. From 2001 to 2004 their live shows included [[Carl Dixon]] (formerly of the bands [[Coney Hatch]], and [[The Guess Who]])<ref name=encyclopop /> on guitars, keyboards and backing vocals.

April Wine entered into its 37th year as a band in 2006. On October 31 of that year, Aquarius Records released ''[[April Wine Rocks!]]'', a new compilation of April Wine favourites, including a bonus live tune and a new album, entitled ''[[Roughly Speaking]]'', was released on November 28, 2006.

In December 2022 Myles Goodwyn announced that he would no longer be touring with the band, turning over his vocal and guitar duties to Marc Parent: "I've had a long career, happy, fulfilling. I've seen much of the world and I'm grateful to continuing support of radio and our fans worldwide, but touring has been very difficult in recent years because of my diabetes and my health comes first, so unfortunately, my touring days are officially over." He only focused on writing and recording. He played his final show with the group in early March 2023 with original April Wine member Jim Henman coming out on stage to take a bow during his farewell speech. Goodwyn died in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] on December 3, 2023, at the age of 75.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/former-april-wine-singer-myles-goodwyn-dead-at-75-1.6671434|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231203213119/https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/former-april-wine-singer-myles-goodwyn-dead-at-75-1.6671434|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 3, 2023|title=Renowned Canadian musician and former April Wine singer Myles Goodwyn dead at 75|website=[[CTV News]]|date=December 3, 2023|access-date=December 3, 2023}}</ref>
