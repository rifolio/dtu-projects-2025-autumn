After Morissette moved to Los Angeles, she met the producer and songwriter [[Glen Ballard]], who believed in her talent enough to let her use his studio. They wrote songs together, with him supporting her sound rather than trying to shape or mold it to his own tastes.<ref name="PeopleintheNews" /><ref name="hitquarters.com" /> In her newfound freeness of creative spirit, they wrote and recorded Morissette's first internationally released album, ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'', and in 1995 she signed a deal with Maverick Records.

Morissette contributed vocals to four tracks on [[Jonathan Elias]]'s project ''[[The Prayer Cycle]]'', which was released in 1999, where she paid homage to her roots by singing in Hungarian on "Mercy" and "Faith", and in French on "Hope" and "Innocence". The same year, she released the live acoustic album ''[[Alanis Unplugged]]'', which was recorded during her appearance on the television show ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. It featured tracks from her previous two albums alongside four new songs, including "[[King of Pain]]" (a cover of [[The Police]] song) and "No Pressure over Cappuccino", which she wrote with her main guitar player, Nick Lashley. The recording of the ''Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' track "[[That I Would Be Good]]", released as a single, became a minor hit on [[hot adult contemporary]] radio in America.

Morissette hosted the [[Juno Awards of 2004]] dressed in a bathrobe, which she took off to reveal a flesh-colored bodysuit, a response to the era of censorship in the U.S. caused by [[Janet Jackson]]'s breast-flash incident during the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]].<ref name="CP-Apr2004" /> She released her sixth studio album, ''[[So-Called Chaos]]'', in May 2004.<ref name="Simonot"/> She wrote the songs on her own again, and co-produced the album with [[Tim Thorney]] and pop music producer [[John Shanks]].

To commemorate the 10th anniversary of ''Jagged Little Pill'' (1995), Morissette released a studio [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic]] version, ''[[Jagged Little Pill Acoustic]]'', in June 2005. The album was released exclusively through [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] retail concept through their coffee shops for a six-week run. The limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and [[HMV]] Canada, who retaliated by removing Morissette's other albums from sale for the duration of Starbucks's exclusive six-week sale.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4095358.stm "Morissette in Starbucks album row"] .

Morissette released the [[greatest hits album]] ''[[Alanis Morissette: The Collection]]'' in late 2005. The lead single and only new track, a cover of [[Seal (musician)|Seal]]'s "[[Crazy (Seal song)|Crazy]]", was an Adult Top 40 and dance hit in the U.S., but achieved only minimal chart success elsewhere. A limited edition of ''The Collection'' features a DVD including a documentary with videos of two unreleased songs from Morissette's 1996 Can't Not Tour: "King of Intimidation" and "Can't Not". (A reworked version of "Can't Not" had also appeared on ''Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie''.)

2006 marked the first year in Morissette's musical career without a single concert appearance showcasing her own songs, with the exception of an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' in January when she performed "Wunderkind".
