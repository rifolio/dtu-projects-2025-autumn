==History==
===Beginnings (1967–1968)===
In 1967, former [[The Searchers (band)|Searchers]] drummer [[Chris Curtis (musician)|Chris Curtis]] contacted London businessman [[Tony Edwards (manager)|Tony Edwards]], in the hope he would manage a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. Curtis' vision was a "supergroup" where the band members would get on and off, like a musical roundabout. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance the venture with his two business partners [[John Coletta]] and Ron Hire, who composed Hire-Edwards-Coletta Enterprises (HEC).<ref name=Thompson2004/>{{rp|27}}

The first recruit to the band was classically trained [[Hammond organ]] player [[Jon Lord]], Curtis' flatmate, who had most notably played with [[the Artwoods]] (led by [[Art Wood]], brother of future [[Faces (band)|Faces]] and [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]], and including [[Keef Hartley]]).<ref>Eder, Bruce. [https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p15491/biography The Artwoods] Allmusic. Retrieved 12 December 2011</ref> Lord was then performing in a backing band for the vocal group [[The Flower Pot Men (band)|The Flower Pot Men]], along with bassist [[Nick Simper]] and drummer [[Carlo Little]] (Simper had previously been in [[Johnny Kidd and the Pirates]], and survived the 1966 car crash that killed Kidd). Lord alerted the two that he had been recruited for the Roundabout project, after which Simper and Little suggested guitarist [[Ritchie Blackmore]], whom Lord had never met.<ref name="darker">{{cite web |url=http://www.nicksimper.com/nick_simper_interview_july83.htm |title=Nick Simper Interview from "Darker than Blue", July 1983 |access-date=15 January 2014 |last=Robinson |first=Simon |date=July 1983 |work=Darker than Blue |publisher=Nick Simper official website |archive-date=20 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120144157/http://www.nicksimper.com/nick_simper_interview_july83.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Simper had known Blackmore since the early 1960s when his first band, the Renegades, debuted around the same time as one of Blackmore's early bands, the Dominators.<ref name=Thompson2004/>{{rp|5}}

HEC persuaded Blackmore to travel in from [[Hamburg]] to audition for the new group. He was making a name for himself as a studio session guitarist, and had also been a member of [[The Outlaws (UK band)|the Outlaws]], [[Screaming Lord Sutch|Screaming Lord Sutch & the Savages]], and [[Neil Christian|Neil Christian & the Crusaders]], the latter band prompting Blackmore's move to Germany. Curtis' erratic behaviour and lifestyle, fuelled by his use of [[LSD]], caused him to display a sudden lack of interest in the project he had started, forcing HEC to dismiss him from Roundabout. However, HEC was now intrigued with the possibilities Lord and Blackmore brought and persuaded Blackmore to return from Hamburg a second time. Lord and Blackmore began the recruitment of additional members, retaining Tony Edwards as their manager.<ref name="Curtis">{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Thompson|author-link=Dave Thompson (author)|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chris-curtis-p67960/biography|title=Chris Curtis Biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=12 December 2011}}</ref> Lord convinced Nick Simper to join on bass, but Blackmore insisted they leave Carlo Little behind in favour of drummer [[Bobby Woodman]].<ref name="darker"/> Woodman was the former drummer for [[Vince Taylor]]'s Play-Boys (for whom he had played under the name Bobbie Clarke). The band, still calling themselves Roundabout, started rehearsing and writing in [[Cadogan Gardens]] in South Kensington.

In March 1968, Lord, Blackmore, Simper and Woodman moved into Deeves Hall, a country house in [[South Mimms]], Hertfordshire.<ref>Dafydd Rees, Luke Crampton (1999). "Rock stars encyclopedia" p.279. DK Publishing.</ref><ref>Frame, Pete (2000). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=GHPVGbDS0KsC&pg=PT65 Pete Frame's Rocking Around Britain]" p.54.

Tagging along with Evans was his band's drummer [[Ian Paice]]. Blackmore had seen an 18-year-old Paice on tour with the Maze in Germany in 1966, and had been impressed by his drumming. The band hastily arranged an audition for Paice, given that Woodman was vocally unhappy with the direction of the band's music.<ref name="darker"/> Both Paice and Evans won their respective jobs, and the line-up was complete.<ref name="autogenerated1983">Welch, Chris. "The Story of Deep Purple", in ''Deep Purple: HM Photo Book'', copyright 1983, Omnibus Press.</ref>

During a brief tour of Denmark and Sweden in April, in which they were still billed as Roundabout, Blackmore suggested a new name: Deep Purple, after his grandmother's favourite song, "[[Deep Purple (song)|Deep Purple]]" by [[Peter DeRose]].<ref name="Curtis"/><ref name="Bloom">{{cite book |author=Jerry Bloom |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcKcrWE8aWgC&pg=PT163 |title=Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore |publisher=Omnibus Press 2008 |isbn=9781846097577 |quote=Blackmore has stated; "It was a song my grandmother used to play on the piano."}}</ref> The group had resolved to choose a name after everyone had posted one on a board in rehearsal. Second to Deep Purple was "Concrete God", which the band thought was too harsh to take on,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tOpB23GGxAIC&pg=PA53 Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to How Band Names Were Formed] p.53.

In May 1968, the band moved into [[Pye Records|Pye]] Studios in London's [[Marble Arch]] to record their debut album, ''[[Shades of Deep Purple]]'', which was released in America in July by [[Tetragrammaton Records]], and in Britain in September by [[EMI|EMI Records]].<ref name=Thompson2004/>{{rp|pp=41–42}} [[Vanilla Fudge]] was a notable influence on the band, with Blackmore claiming that the group started out wanting to be a "Vanilla Fudge clone".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thehighwaystar.com/interviews/blackmore/rb199102xx.html |title=Ritchie Blackmore, Interviews |publisher=Thehighwaystar.com |access-date=7 November 2010}}</ref> The group had success in North America with a cover of [[Joe South]]'s "[[Hush (Billy Joe Royal song)|Hush]]", and by September 1968, the song had reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the US and No. 2 in the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' chart, pushing the ''Shades'' LP up to No. 24 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s pop albums chart.<ref name="Miles">Miles, Barry (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&dq=deep+purple+hush+-+4+billboard&pg=PA264 The British Invasion: The Music, the Times, the Era] p.264.

The band's second album, ''[[The Book of Taliesyn]]'', was recorded quickly and released in North America in October 1968 to coincide with the tour.

Early in 1969, the band released the non-album single "Emmaretta", named after Emmaretta Marks, at that time a cast member of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', whom Evans was trying to seduce.<ref name=Thompson2004/>{{rp|324}} By March of that year, the band had completed recording for their third album, ''[[Deep Purple (album)|Deep Purple]]''. The album included the track "April", which featured strings and woodwind, showcasing Lord's classical antecedents such as [[Bach]] and [[Rimsky-Korsakov]].

Deep Purple's North American record label, Tetragrammaton, delayed production of the ''Deep Purple'' album until after the band's 1969 American tour ended. This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the ''Billboard'' Top 100. Soon after ''Deep Purple'' was finally released in late June 1969, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. Tetragrammaton's assets were eventually assumed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bsnpubs.com/la/tetragrammaton/tetragrammaton.html|title=Tetragrammaton Album Discography}}</ref>

During the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to progress the heavy rock side of the band further. Having decided that Evans and Simper would not fit well with the style they envisioned, both were replaced that summer.<ref>Joel Whitburn (2007).

Deep Purple Mark II was formed in Hanwell Community Centre in West London in the summer of 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thehighwaystar.com/specials/hcc// |title=Deep Purple: specials/hcc/index.html|website=Thehighwaystar.com}}</ref> In search of a new vocalist, Blackmore set his own sights on 19-year-old singer [[Terry Reid]]. Though he found the offer "flattering", Reid was still bound by an exclusive recording contract with his producer [[Mickie Most]] and more interested in his solo career.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/interview-singer-and-guitarist-terry-reid-455709.html |work=The Independent |title=Interview: Singer and guitarist Terry Reid |date=7 March 2007 |access-date=23 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502125422/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/interview-singer-and-guitarist-terry-reid-455709.html |archive-date=2 May 2008}}</ref> Blackmore had no other choice but to look elsewhere. The band sought out singer [[Ian Gillan]] from [[Episode Six (band)|Episode Six]], a band that had released several singles in the UK without achieving any great commercial success. Six's drummer [[Mick Underwood]] – an old comrade of Blackmore's from his days in [[The Outlaws (band)|the Outlaws]] – introduced the band to Gillan and bassist [[Roger Glover]]. According to Nick Simper, "Gillan would join only with Roger Glover."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=4459&type=1&lang=EN |title=Rockpages.gr interview with Nick Simper |last=Anasontzis |first=George |publisher=Rockpages |access-date=25 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901130712/http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=4459&type=1&lang=EN |archive-date=1 September 2014}}</ref> This effectively killed Episode Six, which gave Underwood a persistent feeling of guilt that lasted nearly a decade, until Gillan recruited him for [[Gillan (band)|his new post-Purple band]] in the late 1970s. According to Blackmore, Deep Purple was only interested in Gillan and not Glover, but Glover was retained on the advice of Ian Paice.<ref name="Rosen Interview 1"/>

Mark II's first release was a [[Roger Greenaway]]–[[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]] tune titled "[[Hallelujah (Deep Purple song)|Hallelujah]]".<ref name="Hallelujah"/> At the time of its recording, Nick Simper still thought he was in the band and had called John Coletta to inquire about the recording dates for the song. He then found that the song had already been recorded with Glover on bass. The remaining original members of Deep Purple then instructed management to inform Simper that he had been officially replaced.<ref>{{cite news |title=Simper recalls pain of Purple sacking |url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/deep-purple-nick-simper-pain-of-sacking |access-date=21 March 2020 |agency=Louder Sound.com}}</ref> Despite television appearances to promote the "Hallelujah" single in the UK, the song flopped.<ref name="Hallelujah"/> Blackmore had told the British weekly music newspaper ''[[Record Mirror]]'' that the band "need to have a commercial record in Britain", and described the song as "an in-between sort of thing"—a compromise between the type of material the band would normally record, and openly commercial material.<ref name="Hallelujah">Bloom, Jerry (2008).

In September 1969, the band gained some much-needed publicity in the UK with the ''[[Concerto for Group and Orchestra]]'', a three-movement epic composed by Lord as a solo project and performed by the band at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Malcolm Arnold]].<ref name="Miles"/> Alongside ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' by [[the Moody Blues]] and ''[[Five Bridges]]'' by [[the Nice]], it was one of the first collaborations between a rock band and an orchestra. This live album became their first release with any kind of chart success in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=Deep Purple The Official Charts Company |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=24 December 2011}}</ref> Gillan and Blackmore were less than happy at the band being tagged as "a group who played with orchestras", both feeling that the ''Concerto'' was a distraction that would get in the way of developing their desired hard-rocking style. Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance "you could have put the five smiles together and spanned the [[River Thames|Thames]]." Lord would also write the ''[[Gemini Suite Live|Gemini Suite]]'', another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970, although the band's recording of the piece would not be released until 1993. In 1975, Blackmore stated that he thought the ''Concerto for Group and Orchestra'' was not bad but that the ''Gemini Suite'' was horrible and very disjointed.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steven Rosen |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2010/09/14/ritchie-blackmore-the-rainbow-interview/ |work=Guitar International |year=1975 |title=Ritchie Blackmore Interview: Deep Purple, Rainbow and Dio |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222064521/http://guitarinternational.com/2010/09/14/ritchie-blackmore-the-rainbow-interview/ |archive-date=22 December 2011}}</ref> Roger Glover later noted that Jon Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band in the early years.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Highway Star: Deep Purple's Roger Glover Interviewed |work=The Quietus |date=20 January 2011 |url=https://thequietus.com/articles/05569-deep-purple-interview}}</ref>

Shortly after the orchestral release, Mark II began a hectic touring and recording schedule that was to see little respite for the next four years. The second album, and first studio album, of the Mark II era, released in 1970, was ''[[Deep Purple in Rock|In Rock]]'' (a name supported by the album's [[Mount Rushmore]]-inspired cover), which contained the then-concert staples "[[Speed King]]", "Into The Fire" and "[[Child in Time]]". The non-album single "[[Black Night]]", released around the same time, finally put Deep Purple into the UK Top 10.<ref name="Roberts">Roberts, David (2006). [[British Hit Singles & Albums]]. London: Guinness World Records Limited</ref> The interplay between Blackmore's guitar and Lord's distorted organ, coupled with Gillan's powerful, wide-ranging vocals and the rhythm section of Glover and Paice, now started to take on a unique identity that separated the band from its earlier albums.<ref name="Charlton">Charlton, Katherine (2003).

On the album's development, Blackmore stated: "I got fed up with playing with classical orchestras, and thought, 'well, this is my turn.' Jon was into more classical. I said, 'well you've done that, I'll do rock, and whatever turns out best we'll carry on with.'"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KS3P8AjJCc Steve Rosen Interview with Ritchie Blackmore, 1974] Retrieved from YouTube "Ritchie Blackmore, Guitar God|Part 2/5" on 14 January 2014.</ref> ''In Rock'' performed well, especially in the UK where it reached No. 4, while the "Black Night" single reached No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and the band performed the song live on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref>Jerry Bloom (2007). ''Black Knight'', p. 139. Music Sales Group.</ref><ref name="OCC"/> In addition to increasing sales in the UK, the band were making a name for themselves as a live act, particularly with regard to the sheer volume of their shows and the improvisational skills of Blackmore and Lord. Said Lord, "We took from jazz, we took from old fashioned rock and roll, we took from the classics. Ritchie and myself...used to swap musical jokes and attacks. He would play something, and I'd have to see if I could match it. That provided a sense of humour, a sense of tension to the band, a sense of, 'what the hell's going to happen next?' The audience didn't know, and nine times out of ten, neither did we!"<ref name=Thompson2004/>

A second Mark II studio album, the creatively progressive ''[[Fireball (album)|Fireball]]'', was issued in the summer of 1971, reaching No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="OCC">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/27669/DEEP-PURPLE "Deep Purple: UK Charts"].

Within weeks of ''Fireball''{{'}}s release, the band were already performing songs planned for the next album. One song (which later became "[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]") was performed at the first show of the ''Fireball'' tour, having been written on the bus to a show in Portsmouth, in answer to a journalist's question: "How do you go about writing songs?"<ref>{{cite web |date=15 September 2005 |title=Highway Stars |url=http://www.stevemorse.com/interviews/200310guitarmagazine.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050915142246/http://www.stevemorse.com/interviews/200310guitarmagazine.html |archive-date=15 September 2005 |access-date=11 May 2023}}</ref> On 24 October 1971 during the US leg of the ''Fireball'' tour, the band was set to play the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago when Ian Gillan contracted [[hepatitis]], forcing the band to play without him, with bassist Glover singing the set.

In early December 1971, the band travelled to Switzerland to record ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]''. The album was due to be recorded at the [[Montreux Casino]] using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]], but a fire during a [[Frank Zappa]] and [[the Mothers of Invention]] concert, caused by a man firing a flare gun into the ceiling, burned down the Casino. This incident famously inspired the song "[[Smoke on the Water]]". The album was later recorded in a corridor at the nearby empty [[Hôtel des Alpes-Grand Hôtel|Grand Hôtel de Territet]], with the exception of the music track to "Smoke on the Water". That was recorded at a vacant theatre called The Pavillon before the band was asked to leave.<ref>{{cite news |title=Deep Purple revient sur le lieu où est né "Smoke on the Water" |url=https://www.tdg.ch/culture/musique/deep-purple-revient-smoke-the-water/story/29995483 |access-date=10 April 2020 |work=Tribune deGeneve}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How Deep Purple created their best hit 'Smoke on the Water' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/deep-purple-montreux-jazz-festival-lake-geneva-1971-a8418926.html |access-date=10 April 2020 |work=The Independent}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/heavy-metal/deep-purple-release-machine-head/ Deep Purple release 'Machine Head'] BBC.

Continuing to progress the musical direction of the previous two albums, ''Machine Head'' was released in late March 1972 and became one of the band's most famous releases. It was the band's second No. 1 album in the UK while re-establishing them in North America, hitting No. 7 in the US and No. 1 in Canada.<ref name="OCC"/> It included tracks that became live classics, such as "Highway Star", "[[Space Truckin']]", "[[Lazy (Deep Purple song)|Lazy]]" and "Smoke on the Water", the last of which remains Deep Purple's most famous song.<ref name="Roberts"/><ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/machine-head-r5332/charts-awards Billboard – Machine Head], [[AllMusic]].

In January 1972, the band returned to tour the US once again. They then headed over to play Europe before resuming US dates in March. While in America, Blackmore contracted hepatitis, and the band attempted one show in [[Flint, Michigan]], without a guitarist before attempting to acquire the services of [[Al Kooper]], who rehearsed with the band before bowing out, suggesting [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] guitarist [[Randy California]] instead. California played one show with the group, in [[Quebec City]], Quebec on 6 April, but the rest of this tour was cancelled as well.<ref>[https://www.thehighwaystar.comFAQhistory.html] {{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref>

The band returned to the US in late May 1972 to undertake their third North America tour (of four total that year). A Japan tour in August of that year led to a double live album, ''[[Made in Japan (Deep Purple album)|Made in Japan]]''. Originally intended as a Japan-only release, its worldwide release became an instant hit, reaching platinum status in five countries, including the US. It remains one of rock music's most popular and highest selling live albums.<ref name="Made in Japan"/>

Mark II continued to work and released the album ''[[Who Do We Think We Are]]'' in 1973. Spawning the hit single "[[Woman from Tokyo]]", the album hit No. 4 in the UK charts and No. 15 in the US chart, while achieving gold record status faster than any Deep Purple album released up to that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/deep%20purple |title=The Official Charts Company – Who Do We Think We Are |date=5 May 2013 |publisher=The Official Charts Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/who-do-we-think-we-are-mw0000196958/awards |title=Who Do We Think We Are on ''Billboard'' |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=26 October 2012}}</ref> However, internal tensions and exhaustion were more noticeable than ever.

''[[Burn (Deep Purple album)|Burn]]'', the first album by Deep Purple Mark III, was released in February 1974 to great success, reaching No. 3 in the UK and No. 9 in the US, and was followed by another world tour.<ref name="OCC"/> The [[Burn (Deep Purple song)|title track]], which opens the album and would open most concerts during the Mark III and IV eras, was a conscious effort by the band to embrace the progressive rock movement, which was popularised at the time by bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[King Crimson]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Gentle Giant]]. Another notable song from the album was a slow-burning blues number called "[[Mistreated (song)|Mistreated]]".

Before he joined Deep Purple, Bolin's best-known recordings had been made as a session musician on [[Billy Cobham]]'s 1973 [[jazz fusion]] album ''[[Spectrum (Billy Cobham album)|Spectrum]]'', and as lead guitarist on two post-[[Joe Walsh]] [[James Gang]] albums: ''[[Bang (James Gang album)|Bang]]'' (1973) and ''[[Miami (James Gang album)|Miami]]'' (1974). He had also played with [[Dr. John]], [[Albert King]], [[the Good Rats]], [[Moxy (band)|Moxy]] and [[Alphonse Mouzon]], and was busy working on his first solo album, ''[[Teaser (Tommy Bolin album)|Teaser]]'', when he accepted the invitation to join Deep Purple.<ref name="Talevski"/>
[[File:Tommy Bolin with a Yamaha SX.jpg|thumb|left|Tommy Bolin in 1975.]]
The resulting album from Deep Purple Mark IV, ''[[Come Taste the Band]]'', was released in October 1975, one month before Bolin's ''Teaser'' album. Despite mixed reviews and middling sales (No. 19 in the UK and No. 43 in the US), the collection revitalised the band once again, bringing a new, extreme funk edge to their [[hard rock]] sound.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/g8fd/|title=BBC – Music – Review of Deep Purple – Come Taste the Band: 35th Anniversary Edition |first=Greg |last=Moffitt }}</ref> Bolin's influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Hughes and Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the album's material. Despite Bolin's talents, his personal problems with hard drugs began to surface. During the ''Come Taste the Band'' tour, many fans openly booed Bolin's inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that Bolin was physically hampered by his addiction. At this same time, as he admitted in interviews years later, Hughes was suffering from cocaine addiction.<ref name=MkIV-story>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liGRWQECxZc | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406074106/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liGRWQECxZc| archive-date=6 April 2017|title=Gettin' Tighter: The Story Of Deep Purple Mk.

Bolin went on to record his second solo album, ''[[Private Eyes (Tommy Bolin album)|Private Eyes]]''. On 4 December 1976, after a show in Miami supporting [[Jeff Beck]], Bolin was found unconscious by his girlfriend and bandmates. Unable to wake him, she hurriedly called paramedics, but it was too late. The official cause of death was multiple-drug intoxication. Bolin was 25 years old.<ref name="Talevski">Nick Talevski (2006).

===Band split (1976–1984)===
After the break-up, most of the members of Deep Purple went on to have considerable success in a number of other bands, including [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] (1975–1984, Ritchie Blackmore and, from 1979, Roger Glover),  [[Whitesnake]] (1978–present, David Coverdale, Jon Lord until 1984, and Ian Paice during 1979–1982) and [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] (1978–1982, Ian Gillan). Ian Gillan also joined [[Black Sabbath]] from late 1982 to early 1984 (Glenn Hughes would also join Sabbath for a short time later in the 1980s). The then-defunct Deep Purple began to gain a type of mystical status, with fan-driven reissues and newly assembled live and compilation albums being released throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Deep Purple #4 June 1975 – March 1976 |url=http://www.deep-purple.net/tree/mk4.htm |access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> This fuelled a number of promoter-led attempts to get the band to reform, especially with the revival of the hard rock market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1980, a [[Bogus Deep Purple|touring version of the band]] surfaced with Rod Evans, who had left Captain Beyond at the end of 1973, as the only member who had ever been in Deep Purple, eventually ending in successful legal action from the legitimate Deep Purple camp over unauthorised use of the name. Evans was ordered to pay damages of US$672,000 for using the band name without permission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/aprilskies/65/dp1980.html |year=1998 |work=Captain Beyond website |title=Rod Evans: The Dark Side of the Music Industry |author=Hartmut Kreckel |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313204251/http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/aprilskies/65/dp1980.html |archive-date=13 March 2012 }}</ref>

In April 1984, eight years after the demise of Deep Purple, a full-scale (and legal) reunion took place with the "classic" Mark II line-up of 1969–1973: Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan and Roger Glover.<ref>Billboard (18 May 1985).

The reunion tour followed, starting in Australia and winding its way across the world to North America, then into Europe by the following summer. Financially, the tour was also a tremendous success.

Mark II followed ''Perfect Strangers'' with ''[[The House of Blue Light]]'' in 1987, which was supported by another world tour (interrupted after Blackmore broke a finger on stage while trying to catch his guitar after throwing it in the air). A new live album ''[[Nobody's Perfect (Deep Purple album)|Nobody's Perfect]]'', which was culled from several shows on this tour, was released in 1988. In the UK a new Mark II version of "Hush" was also released in 1988 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Deep Purple.

===Mark V (1989–1992)===
Gillan was fired in 1989; his relations with Blackmore had again soured, and their musical differences had diverged too far. Originally, the band intended to recruit [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]] frontman [[Jimi Jamison]] as Gillan's replacement. After two weeks of sessions with the band, however, Jamison announced he could not join Deep Purple owing to complications with [[Scotti Brothers Records]], his record label.<ref name="aor.nu">{{cite web |url=http://www.aor.nu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=70&Itemid=108 |title=Interview: Jimi Jamison |publisher=aor.nu |access-date=15 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724190412/http://www.aor.nu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=70&Itemid=108 |archive-date=24 July 2011 }}</ref><ref name="picturedwithtin.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.picturedwithin.com/interviews/tbro_int.html |title=25 Years of Deep Purple The Battle Rages On...:Interview with Jon Lord |publisher=pictured within.com |access-date=15 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517061304/http://www.picturedwithin.com/interviews/tbro_int.html |archive-date=17 May 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Eventually, after auditioning several high-profile candidates, including [[Brian Howe (singer)|Brian Howe]] ([[White Spirit (band)|White Spirit]], [[Ted Nugent]], [[Bad Company]]), [[Doug Pinnick]] ([[King's X]]), Australians [[Jimmy Barnes]] ([[Cold Chisel]]) and [[John Farnham]] ([[Little River Band]]), Terry Brock (Strangeways, [[Giant (band)|Giant]]) and Norman "Kal" Swan ([[Tytan (band)|Tytan]], [[Lion (band)|Lion]], [[Bad Moon Rising (band)|Bad Moon Rising]]),<ref name=Thompson2004/>{{rp|259}} the band agreed on [[Joe Lynn Turner]], who had previously been a member of Rainbow with Blackmore and Glover.

This Mark V line-up recorded just one album, ''[[Slaves and Masters]]'' (1990), and undertook a world tour for most of 1991. The album achieved modest success, reaching No. 45 in the UK and No. 87 in the US ''Billboard'' chart,<ref name="AllMusic.com">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4061/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} |title=Billboard album listings for Deep Purple |publisher=AllMusic.com}}</ref> with some fans and critics feeling the music was closer in style to Rainbow than to Deep Purple.

===Second Mark II reunion (1992–1993) and Mark VI (1993–1994)===
With the tour complete, the band set to work on another album, the early sessions of which would see Turner being forced out. 1993 was going to be Deep Purple's 25th anniversary year, with Lord, Paice and Glover (and the record company) wanting Gillan back for another Mark II reunion to celebrate this milestone. Although Blackmore preferred Turner to remain in the group, he grudgingly relented, after requesting and eventually receiving $250,000 in his bank account<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=1453&type=1&lang=EN |title=Ian Gillan Interview |author=George Anasontzis |work=Rockpages.gr |access-date=22 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022044109/http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=1453&type=1&lang=EN |archive-date=22 October 2008 }}</ref> and Mark II completed the aptly titled ''[[The Battle Rages On...]]'' in 1993.

Blackmore still disagreed with the decision, which created more tension between himself and the rest of the band, especially Gillan. Of particular contention was that Gillan had reworked much of the material that had been written with Turner for the new album. Blackmore felt that Gillan's rewrites had made the songs less melodic than they had been in their original versions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gillan |first1=Ian |last2=Cohen |first2=David |year=1993 |title=Child in Time: The Life Story of the Singer from Deep Purple |publisher=Smith Gryphon Limited |isbn=1-85685-048-X |chapter=Chapter 14}}</ref> The band began a European tour, which was documented on the live album ''[[Come Hell or High Water]]'', released in 1994. A live home video of the same name was also released, covering a show in [[Birmingham]], England that displayed a very disgruntled Blackmore, who did not perform many of the guitar parts and who at one point threw a cup of water at a cameraman, for unknown reasons. The complete show was eventually released in 2006 as ''Live at the NEC'' but was quickly withdrawn after Gillan publicly complained, feeling it represented a bad time in the group's history:<ref name="BBC Deep Purple"/> "It was one of the lowest points of my life – all of our lives, actually".<ref name="BBC Deep Purple">[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6400545.stm Deep Purple live album withdrawn] BBC News. Retrieved 2 March 2012</ref>

Blackmore left Deep Purple for the second and final time after a show in [[Helsinki]], Finland in November 1993.<ref name="BBC Deep Purple"/> [[Joe Satriani]] was drafted to complete the Japanese dates in December and stayed on for a European summer tour in 1994. He was asked to join permanently, but his commitments to his contract with [[Epic Records]] prevented this. The band unanimously chose [[Dixie Dregs]] and former [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] guitarist [[Steve Morse]] as Satriani's successor in August 1994.<ref>Daniel Bukszpan, Ronnie James Dio (2003).[https://books.google.com/books?id=YaDDsg0H35gC&dq=steve+morse+1994+deep+purple&pg=PT46 The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal] p.56.

===Mark VII (1994–2002)===
Morse's arrival revitalised the band creatively, and in 1996 a new album titled ''[[Purpendicular]]'' was released, showing a wide variety of musical styles. Though in the [[post-grunge]] mid-1990s it was no surprise that it never made chart success on the ''Billboard'' 200 in the US.<ref name="AllMusic.com"/> This Mark VII line-up then released a new live album ''[[Live at The Olympia '96]]'' in 1997. With a revamped set list to tour, Deep Purple enjoyed successful tours throughout the rest of the 1990s, releasing the harder-sounding ''[[Abandon (album)|Abandon]]'' in 1998, and touring with renewed enthusiasm.

1999 marked the 30th anniversary of the ''Concerto for Group and Orchestra''. Lord, with the help of a Dutch fan, who was also a musicologist and composer, [[Marco de Goeij]], painstakingly recreated the concerto, the original score having been lost. It was once again performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in September 1999, this time with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Paul Mann.<ref name="Buckley"/> The concert also included songs from each member's solo careers, as well as a short Deep Purple set, and the occasion was released as the album ''[[In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra]]'' in 2000.<ref name=Buckley>Buckley, Peter (2003).

AllMusic. Retrieved 4 November 2012</ref> Much of the next few years was spent on the road touring. The group continued forward until 2002 when founding member Lord announced his amicable retirement from the band to pursue personal projects (especially orchestral work). His departure left Ian Paice as the band's sole remaining founder member. Lord left his Hammond organ to his replacement, rock keyboard veteran [[Don Airey]], who had helped Deep Purple out when Lord's knee was injured in 2001. Airey had previously worked with Glover as a member of Rainbow from 1979 to 1982.

===Mark VIII (2002–2022)===
In 2003, the new Mark VIII line-up released ''[[Bananas (Deep Purple album)|Bananas]]'', their first studio album in five years, and began touring in support. [[EMI Records]] refused a contract extension with Deep Purple, possibly because of lower sales.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist,2377.sm?id=70 |date=10 November 2005 |author=Garry Sharpe-Young |title=Roger Glover interview |work=[[Rockdetector]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209140852/http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist%2C2377.sm?id=70 |archive-date=9 February 2006 }}</ref>

[[File:Jimi Hendrix Experience cropped.png|left|thumb|231x231px|Jimi Hendrix was a major influence on Deep Purple]]
According to Ritchie Blackmore, he was inspired by [[the Allman Brothers Band]], [[Vanilla Fudge]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]], but credits [[Jimi Hendrix]] as "the real deal for him and Deep Purple" and praising him as "at least 20 years ahead of his time." Hendrix's songs, "[[Stone Free]]" and "[[Fire (The Jimi Hendrix Experience song)|Fire]]", were the inspirations for "Speed King". Blackmore had the chance to meet Hendrix at [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Hollywood, but they did not talk, he told [[Sirius XM|SiriusXM]]'s Guitar Greats in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Polcaro |first=Rafael |date=March 20, 2025 |title=The 5 bands Ritchie Blackmore said influenced Deep Purple |url=https://rockandrollgarage.com/the-5-bands-ritchie-blackmore-said-influenced-deep-purple/ |access-date=July 8, 2025 |website=Rock and Roll Garage |language=en-US}}</ref>

[[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] was another major influence on Blackmore. After touring with them, Deep Purple was shocked by how heavy their sound was with just three members, making them want to pursue a heavier sound on ''Deep Purple In Rock''. "I really loved [[Leslie West]]'s playing, said Blackmore before reflecting on the first time hearing "[[Mississippi Queen]]".<blockquote>"I remember being in a place in Germany, and Ian [Paice] and I were out drinking together. In those days, you could go to a club and listen to the new records in their entirety that had just come out. Paice and I heard, ‘Mississippi Queen’, and we both went white!

The band were officially inducted on 8 April 2016. The Hall of Fame announced that the following members were included as inductees: Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Ritchie Blackmore, Roger Glover, Ian Gillan, Rod Evans, David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes. Excluded from induction were Nick Simper, Tommy Bolin, Joe Lynn Turner, Joe Satriani, Steve Morse and Don Airey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deep-purple-singer-rock-hall-band-member-exclusions-are-very-silly-20151221 |title=Deep Purple Singer: Rock Hall Band Member Exclusions Are 'Very Silly' |publisher=rollingstone.com |last=Reed |first=Ryan |date=21 December 2015 |access-date=12 April 2016 |archive-date=14 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414112241/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deep-purple-singer-rock-hall-band-member-exclusions-are-very-silly-20151221 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

It was reported that Ian Gillan announced that he was barring Hughes, Coverdale, Evans and Blackmore from playing with them onstage, as these members are not in the current "living, breathing" version of the band. When interviewed by Loudwire he stated however that this was not the case. An email was sent from his management to Blackmore's management but Blackmore claimed he never received said email.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/ian-gillan-deep-purple-rock-hall/|title=Ian Gillan Comments on Deep Purple's Decision to Perform With Current Lineup at Rock Hall Induction|website=Ultimateclassicriock.com|date=19 February 2016 |access-date=14 October 2019}}</ref> Of the seven living inducted members, five showed up.

Since Lord had died in 2012, his wife Vickie accepted his award on his behalf. The current members of the band played "[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]" for the opening performance. After a brief interlude playing the [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]] song "[[Green Onions]]" while photos of the late Jon Lord flashed on the screen behind them, the current Deep Purple members played two more songs: "[[Hush (Billy Joe Royal song)|Hush]]" and their signature tune "[[Smoke on the Water]]". Although barred from playing with Deep Purple, both David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes (as well as Roger Glover) joined fellow inductees [[Cheap Trick]] and an all-star cast to perform a cover of the [[Fats Domino]] song "[[Ain't That a Shame]]".<ref name="2016 RHOF">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deep-purple-rocks-hall-of-fame-with-hits-filled-set-20160408 "Deep Purple Rocks Hall of Fame With Hits-Filled Set"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506193341/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deep-purple-rocks-hall-of-fame-with-hits-filled-set-20160408 |date=6 May 2016 }}.
