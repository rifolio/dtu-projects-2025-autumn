The members of the band initially met at [[University College London]], calling themselves Big Fat Noises and changing to Starfish before the final name. After releasing the extended play ''[[Safety (EP)|Safety]]'' (1998) independently, they signed with [[Parlophone]] in 1999 and issued their debut album, ''[[Parachutes (Coldplay album)|Parachutes]]'' (2000), featuring the breakthrough single "[[Yellow (Coldplay song)|Yellow]]". It earned a [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year]] and a [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]]. The group's follow-up, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]'' (2002), won the same accolades. ''[[X&Y]]'' (2005) completed what they considered a trilogy. Its successor, ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'' (2008), received a [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album]]. Both records topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the [[List of best-selling albums#Best-selling album by year worldwide|best-sellers of their respective years]] globally. ''Viva la Vida''{{'s}} [[Viva la Vida|title track]] was also the first song by British musicians to reach number one in the United States and United Kingdom simultaneously in the 21st century.

Coldplay further expanded their repertoire in subsequent albums, with ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'' (2011), ''[[Ghost Stories (Coldplay album)|Ghost Stories]]'' (2014), ''[[A Head Full of Dreams]]'' (2015), ''[[Everyday Life (Coldplay album)|Everyday Life]]'' (2019), ''[[Music of the Spheres (Coldplay album)|Music of the Spheres]]'' (2021) and ''[[Moon Music]]'' (2024) drawing from genres like [[electronica]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[disco]], [[funk]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[blues]] and [[progressive rock]]. The group's additional endeavours include philanthropy, politics and activism, supporting numerous humanitarian projects and donating 10% of their profits to charity. In 2018, [[Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams|a career-spanning film]] directed by [[Mat Whitecross]] was released for their 20th anniversary.

| quote  = The final name change came courtesy of close friend and fellow [[University College London|UCL]] student Tim Crompton. Tim was in the process of putting a band of old schoolmates together (later called Bettina Motive). While killing time waiting for a delayed removal van, he had considered the name after he found a copy of Philip Horky's book, ''Child's Reflections, Cold Play''. Tim had a list of potential band names but Cold Play was quickly rejected; the future bandmates didn't like it, so they discarded it. Starfish were happy to pick it up.

After the success of ''Parachutes'', Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]'', once again with Ken Nelson producing. They had trouble focusing in London and decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on ''Parachutes''. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording. "[[In My Place]]" was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single because it was the track that made them want to record a second album, following a "strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" three months after the success of ''Parachutes''. According to Martin "one thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming".<ref>Cumberbatch, Franklin (13 August 2002).
