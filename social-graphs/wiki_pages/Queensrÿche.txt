'''Queensrÿche''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|iː|n|z|r|aɪ|k}}) is an American [[progressive metal]] band. It formed in 1980 in [[Bellevue, Washington]], and first went by Cross+Fire and then by the Mob before settling on its current name in 1982.<ref name="allmusic bio">{{cite web|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/queensr%C3%BFche-mn0000315339/biography|title=Queensrÿche – Biography & History|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref><ref name="the_beginning" /><ref name="testimony_rockenfield" /> The band has released 16 studio albums, one [[Extended play|EP]], and several DVDs, and continues to tour and record. The original lineup consisted of guitarists [[Michael Wilton]] and [[Chris DeGarmo]], drummer [[Scott Rockenfield]] and bassist [[Eddie Jackson (musician)|Eddie Jackson]]; lead vocalist [[Geoff Tate]] was recruited in 1982 to round out the band.

Queensrÿche has sold more than 20 million albums worldwide, including more than six million albums in the United States. A leader of the [[progressive metal]] scene of the mid-to-late 1980s, the band is often referred to as one of the genre's "Big Three", along with [[Dream Theater]] and [[Fates Warning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/13-essential-progressive-metal-albums|title=The 13 essential progressive metal albums you need to know|website=[[Kerrang!]]|date=March 12, 2021|access-date=February 12, 2022}}</ref> The band has received three [[Grammy Award]] nominations for songs from the albums. In 1998, drummer Rockenfield received an individual Grammy nomination.

Queensrÿche self-released its [[Queensrÿche (EP)|eponymous EP]] in 1982,<ref name="metaledge">{{cite web|url=https://www.metaledgemag.com/metal-wire/michael-wilton-recalls-the-making-of-queensr%C3%BFches-debut-ep|title=Michael Wilton recalls the making of Queensrÿche's debut EP|website=[[Metal Edge]]|access-date=August 22, 2025}}</ref> and it earned them a following outside of their home state of Washington, as well as a record deal with [[EMI Records]], who reissued the EP the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anybodylistening.net/1981-1983-1.html |title=Queensrÿche: 1981–1983 |publisher=Anybody Listening |access-date=August 22, 2025 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328092855/http://anybodylistening.net/1981-1983-1.html |archive-date=March 28, 2013  }}</ref> Queensrÿche's popularity grew through the 1980s with their first three studio albums, ''[[The Warning (Queensrÿche album)|The Warning]]'' (1984), ''[[Rage for Order]]'' (1986) and ''[[Operation: Mindcrime]]'' (1988), the latter of which is widely considered among the greatest [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[concept album]]s.<ref name="10 Best Metal Concept Albums">{{cite magazine|url=http://loudwire.com/best-metal-concept-albums/ |title=10 Best Metal Concept Albums |magazine=Loudwire |access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name="List: Ten Great Metal Concept Albums">{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/list-ten-great-metal-concept-albums.html |title=List: Ten Great Metal Concept Albums |work=Revolver Magazine |date=October 5, 2015 |access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref> Their fourth album, ''[[Empire (Queensrÿche album)|Empire]]'' (1990), was also very successful and included one of the band's biggest hits "[[Silent Lucidity]]".

Tate was fired from the band after a highly publicized backstage altercation before a show in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, in April 2012. He was replaced with then-[[Crimson Glory]] singer [[Todd La Torre]]. Tate and his wife Susan (who served as the band's manager from 2005 to 2012) filed a lawsuit in a Washington court, claiming that he was wrongfully terminated. The ruling in the [[preliminary injunction]] was that both parties were allowed to use the name Queensrÿche until a court ruling or a settlement decided who would get to use the name.<ref name="court2013">{{cite magazine|url=http://loudwire.com/geoff-tate-wins-court-ruling-continue-using-queensryche-name/ |title=Geoff Tate Wins Court Ruling to Continue Using Queensrÿche Name |magazine=Loudwire |date=October 20, 2012 |access-date=November 29, 2012}}</ref> A settlement was reached on April 17, 2014,<ref name="settlement">{{cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/hd1yfrmzhj5zup4/CERTOFSETTLMTWITHOUTDISMISSAL.pdf |title=Certificate of settlement without dismissal |publisher=Court certificate |date=April 17, 2014 |access-date=April 23, 2014}}</ref> in which founding members Wilton, Rockenfield and Jackson received the rights to the band trademark.

==History==
===1980–1983: From the Mob to Queensrÿche===
The foundations for Queensrÿche began in the late 1970s, when guitarist [[Michael Wilton]] started the band Joker with friends in 1978, and they were joined by guitarist [[Chris DeGarmo]] in 1979.<ref name="the_beginning">{{cite web|url=http://www.queensrychehistory.com/thebeginning.html |title=Before the Storm: The Early Days of Queensrÿche: The Beginning |author=Brett Miller |publisher=QueensrycheHistory.com |access-date=January 3, 2013}}</ref> In 1980, Wilton met drummer [[Scott Rockenfield]] at [[Easy Street Records]] in Seattle,<ref name="al_bio">{{cite web|url=http://anybodylistening.net/rockenfield.html |title=Rockenfield |publisher=Anybody Listening |access-date=December 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726210408/http://anybodylistening.net/rockenfield.html |archive-date=July 26, 2013 }}</ref> and they formed the band Cross+Fire together on July 18 that year.<ref name="testimony_rockenfield">{{cite web |url=http://www.anybodylistening.net/lawsuit/scottrockenfield.pdf |title=Declaration of Scott Rockenfield |publisher=Court declaration |date=July 10, 2012 |access-date=December 3, 2012 |archive-date=January 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114013725/http://www.anybodylistening.net/lawsuit/scottrockenfield.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> They [[cover version|covered]] songs from popular heavy metal bands such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Judas Priest]], and practiced in the garage of Rockenfield's parents<ref name="al_bio" /> which they called "The Dungeon" and fitted with egg cartons as acoustic cladding.<ref name="wikifact">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7-j4Buoi8Q | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211104/g7-j4Buoi8Q| archive-date=2021-11-04 | url-status=live|title=Queensryche – Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? |via=YouTube |date=January 11, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Before long, DeGarmo and bassist [[Eddie Jackson (musician)|Eddie Jackson]] joined Cross+Fire, and the band name was changed to the Mob, after the [[Black Sabbath]] song "The Mob Rules".<ref name="storm_coming">{{cite web|url=http://www.queensrychehistory.com/thestorm.html |title=Before the Storm: The Early Days of Queensrÿche: The Storm is Coming |author=Brett Miller |publisher=QueensrycheHistory.com |access-date=January 3, 2013}}</ref> In need of a singer for a one-off performance at a local rock festival, they recruited Babylon frontman [[Geoff Tate]]. After Babylon broke up, Tate performed a few shows with the Mob, but left because he was not interested in performing heavy metal covers.<ref name="mobbed">{{cite web|url=http://www.queensrychehistory.com/mobbed.html |title=Before the Storm: The Early Days of Queensrÿche: I've Been Mobbed |author=Brett Miller |publisher=QueensrycheHistory.com |access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref>

In 1981, the Mob put together sufficient funds to record a demo tape.<ref name="born">{{cite web|url=http://www.queensrychehistory.com/born.html |title=Before the Storm: The Early Days of Queensrÿche: The Rÿche Is Born |author=Brett Miller |publisher=QueensrycheHistory.com |access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref> Still without a singer, Tate was once again enlisted to help, much to the disapproval of his then-current band, Myth. The group recorded the four songs "[[Queen of the Reich]]", "Nightrider", "Blinded", and "The Lady Wore Black", the latter of which Tate had written the lyrics for. For an entire year, they brought their demo to various labels and were rejected by all of them. The Mob were ultimately offered a management contract by Kim and Diana Harris, the owners of Easy Street Records.<ref name="testimony_wilton">{{cite web |title=Declaration of Michael Wilton |url=http://www.anybodylistening.net/wilton.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122131842/https://www.anybodylistening.net/lawsuit/wilton.pdf |archive-date=Nov 22, 2021 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |website=Anybodylistening.net |publisher=}}</ref> However, as Tate remained committed to staying in Myth, the band reluctantly searched for another singer.<ref name="born" />

Because the name "the Mob" was not available, their manager urged them to choose a different name.<ref name="testimony_wilton" /> They reportedly ran out of ideas, and decided to name the band after the first song on their demo tape, "[[Queen of the Reich]]".<ref name="born" /> The spelling "Queensreich" was modified to prevent association of the band with [[Nazism]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/music/queensryche-faq/ |title=Music: Queensrÿche FAQ |publisher=Faqs.org |access-date=July 31, 2010}}</ref> "ryche" is a Middle English cognate to "Reich" which, like the German word, can mean "realm", "kingdom" or "empire". The name "Queensrÿche" is written with a [[metal umlaut]] over the letter "y". As the band later joked: "The umlaut over the 'y' has haunted us for years. We spent eleven years trying to explain how to pronounce it."<ref name="umlaut">Gidley, Lisa. [http://www.spiraling.com/words/umlaut.html "Spinal Tap's main man explains the importance of the umlaut"]. ''www.spiraling.com''.

===1983–1987: ''The Warning'' and ''Rage for Order''===
Kim Harris sent the demo tape and a band photo to a friend who wrote for ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine, resulting in a glowing review.<ref name="born" /> On the strength of the growing buzz that surrounded them in both the United States and Europe following this review, the Harrises released Queensrÿche's demo tape as a self-titled [[extended play|EP]] on their [[Independent record label|independent label]] 206 Records in 1982.<ref name="metaledge" /><ref name="testimony_wilton" /><ref name="Queensrÿche EP release date">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Queensr%C3%BFche-Queensr%C3%BFche/master/70727|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713020047/http://www.discogs.com/Queensr%C3%BFche-Queensr%C3%BFche/master/70727|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 13, 2010|title=QueensrÃ¿che – QueensrÃ¿che at Discogs|website=[[Discogs]]|date=July 13, 2010|access-date=January 24, 2019}}</ref> After the EP garnered international praise, receiving much [[airplay]] and selling an unusual number of copies for a small independent release,<ref name="born" /> Tate agreed to leave Myth and become Queensrÿche's permanent lead singer.<ref name="testimony_rockenfield" /><ref name="born" />

On June 29 and 30, 1983, Queensrÿche was the [[opening act]] for [[Zebra (American band)|Zebra]] in Portland and Seattle respectively.<ref name="born" /> Kim Harris knew [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] manager Mavis Brodey of [[EMI]]-America from the time she was the music director of [[KZOK-FM]], and he convinced her to come to one of these shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.users.totalise.co.uk/~bigoleg/queensryche/warning/features/kerrang_77.html |title=Behind the screams: Paul Suter traces the heady rise of 'Special Metal' band, Queensrÿche |author=Paul Suter |publisher=Kerrang! issue 77 |year=1984 |access-date=January 13, 2013}}</ref> Brodey offered Queensrÿche a [[Recording contract|contract]] with EMI, spanning 15 years and encompassing seven albums.<ref name="testimony_rockenfield" /> EMI re-released the EP ''[[Queensrÿche (EP)|Queensrÿche]]'' to moderate success, peaking at No.&nbsp;81 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts. The band toured with [[Quiet Riot]] through the [[Southern United States|South]] and with [[Twisted Sister]] to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and Canada, and opened for [[Dio (band)|Dio]] in Seattle.<ref name="born" />

After the EP tour, Queensrÿche travelled to London to record their first full-length album. The band worked with producer [[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]], who had worked with [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Judas Priest]]. Released in September 1984, ''[[The Warning (Queensrÿche album)|The Warning]]'' showed the band in an early stage of development, playing classic heavy metal songs. It peaked at No.&nbsp;61 on the Billboard album chart, a moderate commercial success. While none of the singles released from ''The Warning'' charted domestically, "Take Hold of the Flame" was a hit for the band outside the U.S., and particularly in Japan.<ref name="Japan">Rivadavia, Eduardo.

''[[Rage for Order]]'', released in 1986, introduced a much more polished look and sound for Queensrÿche, while the band was pressured by their management to adopt an image more closely associated with [[glam metal]].<ref name="wikifact" /> Tate later described the period as "we were really into [that] image and we failed miserably."<ref name=":0" /> However, the album itself was slightly more progressive than the band's previous releases, having a layered and complex musical structure, and featuring keyboards as prominently as guitars.<ref name="al1986">{{cite web|url = http://anybodylistening.net/1986-1987-1.html|title = Queensrÿche: 1986–1987|publisher = Anybody Listening|access-date = March 4, 2013|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130328111727/http://anybodylistening.net/1986-1987-1.html|archive-date = March 28, 2013}}</ref> A video was filmed for the song "Gonna Get Close to You", written and originally recorded in 1984 by [[Dalbello]].

In 1988, Queensrÿche released ''[[Operation: Mindcrime]]'', a narrative [[concept album]] that proved a massive critical and commercial success. The album's story revolved around a junkie named Nikki, who is brainwashed into performing assassinations for an underground movement.

The [[power ballad]] "[[Silent Lucidity]]", which featured an orchestra, became the band's first Top 10 single. The arrangements on ''Empire'' were more straightforward than the band's previous efforts.<ref name=":0" />

The subsequent "Building Empires" tour was the first full-fledged tour to feature Queensrÿche as a headlining act (the band had previously headlined a tour in Japan in support of ''Operation: Mindcrime'', and had headlined a handful of club and theater shows in the U.S. between 1984 and 1988, and the UK in 1988). The group used its headlining status to perform ''Operation: Mindcrime'' in its entirety, as well as songs from ''Empire''. The tour lasted 18 months, longer than any tour the band had undertaken before or has since. The tour also added a black page to the band's history, when during a show in a sports hall in [[Ichtegem]], Belgium on November 20, 1990, a scuffle in the audience resulted in an American fan stabbing a Belgian fan fatally in the chest. Tour manager Howard Ungerleider immediately stopped the show as the band was only playing the seventh song on the set list, "Roads to Madness".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anybodylistening.net/11-20-90.html |title=11/20/'90 |publisher=AnybodyListening.net |access-date=April 11, 2013 |archive-date=October 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011121537/http://anybodylistening.net/11-20-90.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> A live album, recorded May 10–12, 1991, was released later that year as ''[[Operation: Livecrime]]''. The tour also included an [[MTV Unplugged]] appearance at Warner Hollywood Studios in Los Angeles on April 27, 1992.

===1994–1997: ''Promised Land'', ''Hear in the Now Frontier'', and DeGarmo's departure===
After taking time off to deal with the [[Occupational burnout|burnout]] resulting from the "Building Empires" tour and with other personal issues, the band released ''[[Promised Land (Queensrÿche album)|Promised Land]]'' in October 1994 (a companion [[CD-ROM]], featuring a ''Promised Land''-themed game and other interactive features, was released in March 1996). It was a dark and personal album, reflecting the mental state of the band at the time. Although the album debuted at No.&nbsp;3 and was eventually certified platinum, it was not the commercial success ''Empire'' had been. As with many other heavy metal and hard rock acts, Queensrÿche's commercial fortunes waned with the surge in popularity of genres such as [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]].

Queensrÿche released their sixth full-length studio album, ''[[Hear in the Now Frontier]]'', in March 1997, to mixed critical and fan reception. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;19 but quickly vanished from the charts. [[Toby Wright (record producer)|Toby Wright]], who produced [[Alice in Chains]]' [[Alice in Chains (album)|self-titled 1995 album]], was brought on board for this effort as engineer. The result was a sound that was more dry and stripped-down than the band's previous material.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-04-01|title=Queensryche-Hear-in-the-Now-Frontier/|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/57445/Queensryche-Hear-in-the-Now-Frontier/}}</ref>

Compounding the disappointing sales of the album were issues that plagued the band on the subsequent tour. Less than one month into the ''Hear in the Now Frontier'' tour, Tate became seriously ill and the band was forced to cancel concert dates for the first time. In an even bigger blow, the band's longtime label, [[EMI America Records]], went bankrupt during the same period. Queensrÿche was forced to use its own money to finance the remaining two months of the tour. The band played a handful of December shows in South America because of contractual obligations, and it was during this time, late 1997,<ref name="chris_left">{{cite web |url=http://scream.org/2000/02/29/screaming-in-digital-issue-263/ |title=Why Chris Left: An Answer |last=Birchall |first=Dan |publisher=Screaming in Digital issue 263 |date=February 29, 2000 |access-date=April 24, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130615211026/http://scream.org/2000/02/29/screaming-in-digital-issue-263/ |archive-date=June 15, 2013 }}</ref> that founding member Chris DeGarmo announced he was leaving Queensrÿche.

His involvement with music has since been sporadic. He remains highly regarded in the eyes of Queensrÿche's fan base.

===1997–2004: ''Q2K'', side projects, and ''Tribe''===
DeGarmo was replaced by producer [[Kelly Gray (musician)|Kelly Gray]] on rhythm guitar. Gray's connections with Queensrÿche went back to the early '80s, when he was the guitarist for Myth, which was also the band Tate fronted prior to joining Queensrÿche. Gray had previously worked as a producer for bands such as [[Dokken]] and [[Candlebox]]. Queensrÿche recorded one studio album with Gray, ''[[Q2K]]'' from 1999, which was also the first album for their new label, [[Atlantic Records]]. Musically, ''Q2K'' bore little resemblance to the progressive metal of the band's past, and also displayed a similar stripped-down sound as ''Hear in the Now Frontier''. Tate has described ''Q2K'' as a continuation of the experimentation of ''Hear in the Now Frontier''. Declining popularity forced the band to tour in clubs and theaters, rather than in the larger arenas and outdoor amphitheaters where they played before. Following the ''Q2K'' tour, Rockenfield and Gray formed the [[side project]] [[Slave to the System]] with band members from [[Brother Cane]] and recorded a [[Slave to the System (album)|self-titled album]].

After the release of a [[Greatest Hits (Queensrÿche album)|greatest hits]] collection in 2000, Queensrÿche embarked on another tour, this time in support of [[Iron Maiden]]. This enabled the band to play [[Madison Square Garden]] for the first time. Unhappy with the lack of support they felt they received from Atlantic Records, Queensrÿche moved to [[Sanctuary Records]] in 2001. In July of that year, the band performed a handful of dates at the [[Moore Theatre]] in Seattle, Washington. The shows were recorded and released in September 2001 as ''[[Live Evolution]]'', the band's second live album. Throughout 2001 and 2002, Tate worked on his [[Geoff Tate (album)|self-titled first solo album]], which was released on June 25, 2002.

Gray was fired from the band in May 2002,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=3559 |title=Queensrÿche Frontman Speaks Out On Gray Split, DeGarmo Rumors |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=May 17, 2002 |access-date=January 13, 2013}}</ref> which according to Rockenfield was "because of [his] personal [[substance abuse|abuse]] habits and ongoing problems".<ref name="testimony_rockenfield" /><ref name="testimony_jackson">{{cite web |url=http://www.anybodylistening.net/lawsuit/jackson.pdf |title=Declaration of Eddie Jackson |publisher=Court declaration |date=June 9, 2012 |access-date=December 4, 2012 |archive-date=January 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114012710/http://www.anybodylistening.net/lawsuit/jackson.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band entered the studio as a quartet in the spring of 2003 to record their eighth full-length album, while a compilation of greatest hits was released as part of the [[Classic Masters (Queensrÿche album)|Classic Masters]] series on March 9, 2003. In April, they announced they had been joined by Chris DeGarmo, although his future status with the band was uncertain. In July, Queensrÿche released its first and only album of new material on the Sanctuary label, ''[[Tribe (Queensrÿche album)|Tribe]]''. DeGarmo, who played on and co-wrote four songs, neither officially rejoined the band nor took part in the supporting tour.

Queensrÿche found a replacement for Gray in [[Mike Stone (musician)|Mike Stone]], who had previously worked on Tate's solo album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/GeoffTate.htm |author=Maureen McQueeney |title=Geoff Tate Interview |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |year=2004 |access-date=January 13, 2013}}</ref> Stone accompanied the band on the ''Tribe'' tour as second guitarist to Wilton's lead, though he never was a full member of the band. In June 2003, Queensrÿche launched a co-headlining tour featuring another progressive metal band, [[Dream Theater]]. The two bands alternated the opening and closing slots, and ended the shows by playing a handful of songs together. [[Fates Warning]] was the special guest for the tour. A recording from this tour was released to CD and DVD as ''[[The Art of Live]]'', which included two covers performed with Dream Theater.

Over the course of the five album releases ('Q2K', 'Tribe', 'Operation: Mindcrime II', 'American Soldier' and 'Dedicated To Chaos') after DeGarmo left, the band had gone through three rhythm guitarists, five record companies and four management firms. Q-Prime had taken over management duties before 'Operation: Mindcrime'; they were eventually replaced by Ray Daniels during the 'Q2K' sessions, who was then subsequently replaced by Lars Sorensen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://exodusattack.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=13787&p=417165|title=The Official EXODUS Forum • View topic – QueensRyche Drama|website=Exodusattack.com|access-date=October 3, 2019|archive-date=November 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104125955/http://exodusattack.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=13787&p=417165|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following the ''Tribe'' tour, Lars Sorensen was dismissed, and Geoff Tate's wife Susan was promoted to band manager, after having worked as an assistant manager for the band since 2001.<ref name="testimony_susantate">{{cite web |url=http://anybodylistening.net/lawsuit/susantate2.pdf |title=Declaration of Susan Tate |publisher=Court declaration |date=June 9, 2012 |access-date=December 8, 2012 |archive-date=January 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114013627/http://anybodylistening.net/lawsuit/susantate2.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> In this period, Wilton spent time recording the [[Soulbender (album)|self-titled album]] of his side project [[Soulbender]].

===2004–2007: ''Operation: Mindcrime II''===
In July 2004, Queensrÿche announced its plans to record a follow-up to 1988's ''[[Operation: Mindcrime]]''. To generate fan interest in the upcoming album, the band hit the road in the fall of 2004 with the "An Evening With Queensrÿche" tour. The tour opened with a shortened greatest hits set, followed by a revised production of ''Operation: Mindcrime'' with live actors and video; [[Pamela Moore]] reprised her role as Sister Mary. The band played a pre-recorded version of "Hostage," a track from the upcoming album, through the PA as an encore after the end of their set. The second leg of the tour began in early 2005. Before embarking on a third leg in the fall of 2005, Queensrÿche toured with [[Judas Priest]] across North America, playing an hour-long set consisting mostly of the band's older works and one song from the soon-to-be released sequel, entitled "I'm American".

''[[Operation: Mindcrime II]]'' was released internationally on March 31, 2006. The album was Queensrÿche's first for their new label, [[Rhino Entertainment]], to which it signed in 2005. [[Ronnie James Dio]] provided the vocals for Dr. X, the villain. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;14, the highest chart position for a Queensrÿche album since 1997. The group embarked on a headlining tour in support of the album, joined by Pamela Moore in her role as Sister Mary.<ref name="erikremec.com">{{cite web|url=http://erikremec.com/pamelamoore.html|title=Sister Mary Breaks Her Silence : 2007 Interview with Erik Remec for FREE!

[[File:Queensrÿche in Barcelona.jpg|thumb|Queensrÿche performing in Barcelona in 2008]]
On August 9, 2007, the band announced that it would release a new greatest hits album, entitled ''[[Sign of the Times: The Best of Queensrÿche|Sign of the Times]]''. The album was released on August 28, 2007, and a special collector's edition featured a bonus disc including various demos and a new song, "Justified", featuring Chris DeGarmo on guitar. On November 13, 2007, the band released an album of covers entitled ''[[Take Cover (album)|Take Cover]]''. The album contains covers of songs by [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[U2]], [[The Police]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Peter Gabriel]], and [[Pink Floyd]], and was the band's second release for Rhino Records. On February 3, 2009, Stone announced the end of his association with Queensrÿche to focus on his side project [[Speed-X]], although court declarations later revealed Geoff and Susan Tate fired him for "making too many grand demands", without discussing their decision with the other band members.<ref name="testimony_wilton" />

Wilton recorded both lead and rhythm guitar on the band's eleventh studio album, ''[[American Soldier (album)|American Soldier]]'', released on March 31, 2009.

In late 2009 and early 2010, the band toured for The Queensrÿche [[Cabaret]]. In November 2010, Queensrÿche played several shows for U.S. troops stationed in Iraq. While at a U.S. military position, explosive shells began falling on the base as the result of a bomb attack.

[[File:Queensryche soundcheck Halfway Jam 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Queensrÿche with Todd La Torre in 2012.]]
Meanwhile, Tate, along with his wife, moved forward with the lawsuit they had filed against his former bandmates, claiming unlawful termination<ref name="nochoice" /> and seeking a [[preliminary injunction]] to prevent both himself and the remaining bandmembers from using the Queensrÿche name until the issue was resolved. While the Washington state [[superior court]] denied this motion on July 13, 2012, they also denied a counter-motion for a preliminary [[summary judgment]] filed by the defense (Wilton, Jackson, and Rockenfield); collectively, these rulings enabled both parties to use the brand "Queensrÿche" until a court ruling or settlement further clarified the matter.<ref name="court2013" /> Subsequent to this temporary verdict, both entities toured with independent bands under the "Queensrÿche" moniker between June 2012 and April 2014, with one incarnation consisting of the remaining Queensrÿche members fronted by La Torre, and the other featuring Tate with his own lineup. In addition, both versions of the group released studio albums during this time, with Geoff Tate's incarnation releasing ''[[Frequency Unknown]]'' in April 2013, and the La Torre-fronted lineup releasing a [[Queensrÿche (album)|self-titled album]] two months later.

A settlement was reached on April 17, 2014,<ref name="settlement" /> and a statement from both parties was released on April 28, 2014.<ref name="Name Settlement" /> The statement announced that Tate lost the brand Queensrÿche to Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson, who together with La Torre and Lundgren are to be "the sole band recording and touring as Queensrÿche", while former vocalist Tate solely has the right to play ''Operation: Mindcrime'' and ''Operation: Mindcrime II'' in their entirety "in unique performances".

==Tri-Ryche logo==
Queensrÿche's logo, the so-called Tri-Ryche (written without an umlaut on the 'y'), also stems from the band's early years. Artist Wes "Grizz" Griswold, who made the artwork for the ''Queensrÿche'' EP, used to sign his work with a [[doodle]] morphed from a crude drawing of a [[peregrine falcon]].<ref name="mythology">{{cite web|url=http://www.queensrychehistory.com/mytholog.html |title=Mythology |author=H.D.
