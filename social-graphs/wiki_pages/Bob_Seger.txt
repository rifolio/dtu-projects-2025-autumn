''' Robert Clark Seger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|g|ər}} {{respell|SEE|gər}}; born May 6, 1945) is a retired American singer, songwriter, and musician. As a locally successful [[Detroit]]-area artist, he performed and recorded with the groups '''Bob Seger and the Last Heard''' and ''' the Bob Seger System''' throughout the 1960s, breaking through with his first album, ''[[Ramblin' Gamblin' Man]]'' (which contained his first national hit of the same name) in 1969. By the early 1970s, he had dropped the 'System' from his recordings and continued to strive for broader success with various other bands. In 1973, he put together [[#The Silver Bullet Band|The Silver Bullet Band]], with a group of Detroit-area musicians, with whom he became most successful on the national level with the album ''[[Live Bullet]]'' (1976), recorded live in 1975 at [[Cobo Hall]]. In 1976, he achieved a national breakout with the studio album ''[[Night Moves (album)|Night Moves]]''. On his studio albums, he also worked extensively with the [[Alabama]]-based [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]], which appeared on several of Seger's best-selling singles and albums.

A [[roots rock]] musician known for his raspy, powerful voice, Seger is one of the best-known artists of the [[heartland rock]] genre, with his songs often concerning love, women, and [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] themes. Among his many hits are "[[Night Moves (Bob Seger song)|Night Moves]]", "[[Turn the Page]]", "[[Mainstreet]]", "[[Still the Same (Bob Seger song)|Still the Same]]", "[[Hollywood Nights]]", "[[Against the Wind (Bob Seger song)|Against the Wind]]", "[[You'll Accomp'ny Me]]", "[[Shame on the Moon]]", "[[Roll Me Away]]", "[[Like a Rock (song)|Like a Rock]]", and "[[Shakedown (Bob Seger song)|Shakedown]]", the last of which was written for the 1987 film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]'' and topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|'' Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.  His recording of "[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]" was named one of the [[Songs of the Century]] in 2001, and he co-wrote the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' number-one hit "[[Heartache Tonight]]".

With a career spanning six decades, Seger has sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling artists of all time]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pjstar.com/news/20180918/bob-seger-coming-to-peoria-civic-center-arena |title=Bob Seger coming to Peoria Civic Center Arena |first=Phil |last=Luciano |work=[[Journal Star (Peoria)|Journal Star of Peoria]] |date=September 18, 2018 |access-date=January 13, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210318110731/https://www.pjstar.com/news/20180918/bob-seger-coming-to-peoria-civic-center-arena |archive-date=18 March 2021 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Seger was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2004 and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/bob-seger/ |title=Bob Seger: inducted in 2004 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=August 6, 2013}}</ref><ref name="rollingstone1">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-seger-gordon-lightfoot-jim-steinman-inducted-into-songwriters-hall-of-fame-20120615 |title=Bob Seger, Gordon Lightfoot, Jim Steinman Inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame &#124; Music News |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=June 15, 2012 |access-date=August 6, 2013 |archive-date=January 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131205822/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-seger-gordon-lightfoot-jim-steinman-inducted-into-songwriters-hall-of-fame-20120615 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="billboard1">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/483079/bob-seger-gordon-lightfoot-among-songwriter-hall-inductees |title=Bob Seger, Gordon Lightfoot Among Songwriter Hall inductees |magazine=Billboard |access-date=August 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://songhall.org/news/entry/songwriters_hall_of_fame_announces_2012_inductees |title=Songwriters Hall of Fame Announces 2012 Inductees |publisher=SongHall |access-date=August 6, 2013}}</ref> Seger was named ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} 2015 Legend of Live honoree at the 12th annual [[Billboard Live Music Awards|''Billboard'' Touring Conference & Awards]], held November 18–19 at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Manhattan)|Roosevelt Hotel]] in New York.

==Early years==
Seger was born at [[Henry Ford Hospital]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annarbor.com/entertainment/bob-seger-interview/ |title=Bob Seger reflects on growing up in Ann Arbor, looks forward to concert at EMU |publisher=[[The Ann Arbor News]] |access-date=December 7, 2016}}</ref> the son of Charlotte and Stewart Seger. At age five, he moved with his family to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. He had an older brother, George.<ref name=oral/>

Seger's father, a medical technician for [[Ford Motor Company]], played several instruments and Seger was exposed to music from an early age.<ref name=oral/> Seger was also exposed to frequent arguments between his parents that disturbed the neighborhood at night.<ref name=oral/> In 1956, when Seger was 10 years old, his father abandoned the family and moved to [[California]].<ref name=oral/> The remaining family soon lost their comfortable [[Middle class|middle-class]] status and struggled financially.<ref name=oral/>

Seger attended Tappan Junior High School (now [[Tappan Middle School]]) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and graduated in 1963 from Ann Arbor High School, now known as [[Pioneer High School (Ann Arbor, Michigan)|Pioneer High School]]. He ran track and field in high school. Seger also went to [[Lincoln Park High School (Lincoln Park, Michigan)|Lincoln Park High School]] for a time.<ref name=bsd>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenewsherald.com/news/bob-seger-day-set-for-friday-in-lincoln-park/article_749c58cf-717e-5db1-8db3-71caf5bb1f54.html|title=Bob Seger Day set for Friday in Lincoln Park|last=Herndon|first=Dave|date=November 16, 2017|work=News-Herald|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-date=March 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210318112550/https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/bob-seger-day-set-for-friday-in-lincoln-park/article_749c58cf-717e-5db1-8db3-71caf5bb1f54.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Regarding his early musical inspirations, Seger has stated, "[[Little Richard]] – he was the first one that really got to me. Little Richard and, of course, [[Elvis Presley]]."<ref name="Influences">{{cite web |url=http://www.segerfile.com/influences.html |title=Influences |publisher=Seger File |access-date=August 10, 2009 |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117071355/http://www.segerfile.com/influences.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> "[[Come Go with Me]]" by [[The Del-Vikings]], a hit in 1957, was the first record he bought.

==Regional favorite and first national hit: 1961–1976==

===The Decibels and The Town Criers===
Bob Seger arrived on the Detroit music scene in 1961 fronting a three-piece band called the Decibels. The band included Seger on guitar, piano, keyboards, and vocals, Pete Stanger on guitar, and R.B. Hunter on drums. All of the members attended Ann Arbor High. The Decibels recorded an [[acetate disc|acetate]] demo of a song called "The Lonely One", at [[Del Shannon]]'s studio in 1961. As well as being Seger's first original song, "The Lonely One" was Seger's first song to be played on the radio, airing once on an Ann Arbor radio station.<ref name=oral>{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20070312/ENT04/103120103/|title=A definitive oral history of Seger's early years|author=Brian McCollum| newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=March 14, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413173516/http://www.freep.com/article/20070312/ENT04/103120103/|archive-date=April 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Goldmine>{{cite news | author=Joanne Zangrilli | title=Going the Distance | magazine=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]] | date=November 1990}}</ref> In 2021, a recording of "The Lonely One" resurfaced, and was broadcast (with permission from Seger) twice on [[WCSX]]-FM in Detroit.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/03/12/first-bob-seger-song-ever-recorded-play-wcsx-monday/4664560001/|title=First Bob Seger song ever recorded to play on WCSX Monday|author=Melody Baetens| newspaper=[[The Detroit News]]|date=March 12, 2021}}</ref>

After the Decibels disbanded, Seger joined the Town Criers, a four-piece band with Seger on lead vocals, John Flis on bass, Pep Perrine on drums, and Larry Mason on lead guitar. The Town Criers, covering songs like "[[Louie Louie]]", grew a steady following. Meanwhile, Seger was listening to [[James Brown]] and said that, for him and his friends, ''[[Live at the Apollo (1963 album)|Live at the Apollo]]'' was their favorite record following its release in 1963. Seger was also influenced by the music of [[The Beatles]], once they hit American shores in 1964. In general, he and local musician friends such as [[Glenn Frey]] (later a member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]) bought into the premises of 1960s pop and rock radio, with its hook-driven hits; he later recalled himself and Frey thinking at the time, "You're nobody if you can't get on the radio."<ref name="cst-2011"/>

=== Doug Brown & The Omens ===
As the Town Criers landed more gigs, Seger met Doug Brown, who fronted The Omens. Seger joined the band, as they were more established than the Town Criers. While Brown was the primary lead vocalist, Seger took the lead on some [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] numbers<ref name=oral/> and made his first appearance on an officially released recording, the 1965 single "TGIF" (backed with "First Girl"), credited to Doug Brown and The Omens. Seger later appeared on Doug Brown and The Omens' parody of [[Barry Sadler]]'s song "[[Ballad of the Green Berets]]", re-titled "Ballad of the Yellow Beret", which mocked [[draft evader]]s. Soon after its release, Sadler and his label threatened Brown and his band with a lawsuit, and the recording was withdrawn.<ref name="ReferenceA">Rolling Stone Editors. ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll: Revised and Updated for the 21st Century''. New York: Fireside, 2001.</ref>

While with The Omens, Seger met his future manager [[Punch Andrews|Edward "Punch" Andrews]], who at the time was partnered with Dave Leone running the Hideout franchise, consisting of four clubs ranging from Clawson to Rochester Hills, where local acts could play, and a small-scale record label. Seger started writing and producing other acts that Punch managed, such as the Mama Cats and the Mushrooms (with Glenn Frey). Seger and Brown were then approached by Punch and Leone to write a song for the Underdogs, a local band who recently had a hit with "Man in the Glass". Seger contributed a song called "[[East Side Story (Bob Seger song)|East Side Story]]", which was unsuccessful.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

=== The Last Heard ===
Seger decided to record "East Side Story" and officially left the Omens (though he retained Brown as a producer). As Bob Seger and the Last Heard, Seger released his version of the song on Hideout Records in 1966, and it became his first big Detroit hit. The single (backed with "East Side Sound", an instrumental version of the single's A Side) sold 50,000 copies locally and led to a contract with [[Cameo-Parkway Records]]. Though the name "The Last Heard" originally referred to the collection of Omens and Town Criers who recorded "East Side Story" with Seger, it soon became the name of Seger's band, made up of former Town Crier Pep Perrine on drums, Carl Lagassa on guitar, and Dan Honaker on bass. Following "East Side Story", the group released four more singles: the [[James Brown]]-inspired holiday single "Sock It to Me Santa", the [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]]-esque "Persecution Smith", "Vagrant Winter", and perhaps the most notable, "[[Heavy Music]]", in 1967. "Heavy Music", which outsold "East Side Story", had the potential to break out nationally when Cameo-Parkway went out of business. It was a top 100 hit in Canada, where it topped out on the national RPM charts at {{Numero|82}}; in the US, it just missed the Hot 100, peaking on the "bubbling under" chart at {{Numero|103}}. The song would stay in Seger's live act for many years to come.

=== The Bob Seger System ===
After Cameo-Parkway folded, Seger and Punch searched for a new label. In the spring of 1968, Bob Seger & the Last Heard signed with major label [[Capitol Records]], turning down [[Motown Records]], who offered more money than Capitol. Seger felt that Capitol was more appropriate for his genre than Motown.<ref name=oral/>

Capitol changed the name of the band to The Bob Seger System. In the transition between labels, guitarist Carl Lagassa left, and keyboard player Bob Schultz joined. The System's first single was the anti-war message song "[[2 + 2 = ?]]", reflecting a marked change in Seger's political attitude from "The Ballad of the Yellow Beret". The single was a hit in Detroit and reached number 1 in [[Buffalo, New York]] and [[Orlando, Florida]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=14146 | title=Bob Seger System – 2 + 2 = ? <nowiki>[1968]</nowiki> | publisher=ARSA <!-- access-date=unknown --> | access-date=August 18, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808054306/http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=14146 | archive-date=August 8, 2014 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> but went unnoticed almost everywhere else and failed to chart nationally in the US. The single did, however, make the Canadian national charts, peaking at {{Numero|79}}.

The second single was "[[Ramblin' Gamblin' Man (song)|Ramblin' Gamblin' Man]]". It was a major hit in [[Michigan]], and became Seger's first nationwide hit, peaking at {{Numero|17}}. Its success led to the release of an album in 1969. ''[[Ramblin' Gamblin' Man]]'' went to {{Numero|62}} on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' pop albums chart]]. Glenn Frey got his first studio gig singing back-up and playing guitar on "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man".<ref>''[[History of the Eagles]]''. Sundance Institute, 2013</ref>

Seger was unable to follow up this success. For the next album, singer-songwriter Tom Neme joined The System, ultimately writing and singing the majority of the tunes featured, for which the group was heavily criticized. ''[[Noah (The Bob Seger System album)|Noah]]'' (1969) failed to chart, leading Seger to briefly quit the music industry to attend college. He returned the following year and put out the System's final album, 1970's ''[[Mongrel (The Bob Seger System album)|Mongrel]]'', without Neme. Bob Schultz left as well, and was replaced by Dan Watson. ''Mongrel'', with the powerful single "[[Lucifer (Bob Seger song)|Lucifer]]", was considered a strong album by critics and fans, but failed to sell.  The Bob Seger System was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |last=Advertising |first=OJ |title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends - Bob Seger System (a.k.a.

=== Solo ===
After ''Mongrel'' failed to live up to the success of ''Ramblin' Gamblin' Man'', The System disbanded. For a short time following the breakup, Seger had ambitions to be a one-man act.<ref name="travelin man">Tom Weschler and [[Gary Graff]]. ''Travelin' Man: On the road and behind the scenes with Bob Seger''. Detroit, Michigan: Wayne State University Press, 2009.</ref> In 1971, he released a solo album, the all-acoustic ''[[Brand New Morning (Bob Seger album)|Brand New Morning]]''. It was a commercial failure and led to his departure from Capitol.<ref name=Goldmine/><ref>{{cite news |last=White |first=Timothy |author-link=Timothy White (editor) |magazine=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |year=1983 |title=The Roads Not Taken}}</ref>

Having thus regained an eye for bands,<ref name="travelin man"/> Seger started playing with the duo [[Teegarden & Van Winkle]], who in 1970 had a hit with "God, Love, and Rock & Roll". Together they recorded ''[[Smokin' O.P.'s]]'' (1972), released on Punch Andrews' own Palladium Records. The album mainly consisted of covers, spawning a minor hit with a version of [[Tim Hardin]]'s "[[If I Were a Carpenter (song)|If I Were a Carpenter]]" ({{Numero|76}} the US), though it did feature "Someday", a new Seger original, and a re-release of "Heavy Music". The album reached 180 on the Billboard 200.

After spending most of 1972 touring with Teegarden & Van Winkle, Seger left to put together a new backing band, referred to as both My Band and the Borneo Band, made up of musicians from [[Tulsa]]. [[Jamie Oldaker]], Dick Sims, and [[Marcy Levy]] were all members of My Band before joining [[Eric Clapton]]. In 1973, Seger put out ''[[Back in '72]]'', recorded partly with the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]], a renowned group of [[session musician]]s who had recorded with the likes of [[J. J. Cale]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name="segerfile_72">[http://www.segerfile.com/72.html Segerfile.com: Back in '72] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731205642/http://www.segerfile.com/72.html |date=July 31, 2015 }}. "Working with Muscle Shoals". Excerpted from Chris Cioe, [[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]. "Bob Seger: Hymns from the heartland".</ref> According to Seger, there was a financial misunderstanding with the musicians: they offered to record him "for $1500 a side", which he took to mean $1500 per album side. When he found out that they meant $1500 per song, he left after recording three songs but resolved to work with them in the future.<ref name="segerfile_72"/> ''Back in '72'' featured the studio version of Seger's later live classic "[[Turn the Page (Bob Seger song)|Turn the Page]]"; "Rosalie", a song Seger wrote about [[CKLW]] music director [[Rosalie Trombley]] (and which was later recorded by [[Thin Lizzy]]); and "[[I've Been Working]]", a song originally by [[Van Morrison]], a strong influence on Seger's musical development.{{refn|Mentioning [[Frankie Miller]], covering Miller's song "Ain't Got No Money" on ''[[Stranger in Town (album)|Stranger in Town]]'' album, and also [[Graham Parker]], [[John Fogerty]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], Seger has remarked: "There's a whole little clique of male vocalists. We're just sort of all connected. I think every last one of us has a connection with Van Morrison."<ref name="Influences"/>}} Despite the strength of Seger's backup musicians, the album only reached 188 on the US charts and faded into obscurity. Even so, ''Back in '72'' and its supporting tour mark the beginnings of Seger's long-time relationships with future Silver Bullet Band saxophonist [[Alto Reed]], powerhouse female vocalist [[Shaun Murphy (singer)|Shaun Murphy]], and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Over the tour, My Band would prove to be unreliable, which frustrated Seger. By the end of 1973, Seger left My Band in search of a new backing band. Throughout 1974–75, Seger continued to perform in local venues around his hometown while known as the Bob Seger Group including one renowned concert in Davisburg, Michigan, called the "Battle of the Bands".

=== The Silver Bullet Band ===
[[File:Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band 1977.JPG|thumb|Seger (bottom right) and the Silver Bullet Band in 1977]]
In 1974, Seger formed the Silver Bullet Band. Its original members were guitarist [[Drew Abbott]], drummer and backing vocalist Charlie Allen Martin, keyboardist and backing vocalist Rick Manasa, bass guitarist Chris Campbell, and saxophonist and backing vocalist [[Alto Reed]]. With this new band sitting in occasionally, Seger released ''[[Seven (Bob Seger album)|Seven]]'' (1974), which contained the Detroit-area hard-rock hit "Get Out of Denver". This track was a modest success and charted at {{Numero|80}} nationally.

In 1975, Seger returned to Capitol for ''[[Beautiful Loser]]'', with help from the Silver Bullet Band (with new keyboardist Robyn Robbins replacing Manasa) on his cover of the [[Tina Turner]] penned "[[Nutbush City Limits]]". The album's single "[[Katmandu (Bob Seger song)|Katmandu]]", later featured in ''[[Mask (1985 film)|Mask]]'', was Seger's first national break-out since "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man". Although it just missed the US Pop Top 40 – peaking at {{Numero|43}} – the song received strong airplay in several markets nationwide including Detroit.

In April 1976, Seger and the Silver Bullet Band released ''[[Live Bullet]]'', recorded over two nights at Detroit's [[Cobo Arena]] in September 1975. It contained Seger's rendition of "Nutbush City Limits" as well as his classic take on life on the road, "[[Turn the Page (Bob Seger song)|Turn the Page]]", from ''Back in '72''. It also included his late 1960s successful releases – "Heavy Music" and "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man". Critic [[Dave Marsh]] later wrote that "''Live Bullet'' is one of the best live albums ever made ... In spots, particularly during the medley of "Travelin' Man"/"Beautiful Loser" on side one, Seger sounds like a man with one last shot at the top."<ref name="p. 454">{{cite book|author=Dave Marsh|author-link=Dave Marsh|author2=John Swenson|title=[[New Rolling Stone Record Guide]]|year=1983|publisher=Rolling Stone Press/Random House|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-394-72107-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstoner00mars/page/454 454–455]}}</ref> An instant best-seller in Detroit, ''Live Bullet'' got attention in other parts of the country, outselling Seger's previous albums, received [[progressive rock (radio format)|progressive rock radio]] and [[album-oriented rock]] airplay, and enabled Seger to headline shows.<ref name="greil-nm">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6N9LAAAAIBAJ&pg=5806,3977654 |title= Bob Seger Never Forgets | author=Greil Marcus | author-link=Greil Marcus | newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] | date=December 13, 1976}}</ref> But there was still a popularity imbalance; in 1976, he was a featured performer at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in metro Detroit in front of nearly 80,000 fans, but one night later played to fewer than a thousand people in Chicago.<ref>{{cite news | author=Mary Campbell | title=Bob Seger to storm into Poplar Creek with rock poetry | newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=July 25, 1986}}</ref>

Seger finally achieved his commercial breakthrough with his October 1976 album ''[[Night Moves (album)|Night Moves]]''. The title track was critically<ref>{{cite news|last=Greil|first=Marcus|date=December 13, 1976|title=Bob Seger Never Forgets|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6N9LAAAAIBAJ&pg=5806,3977654|newspaper=The Village Voice}}</ref> and commercially well-received, becoming a {{Numero|4}} hit on the Billboard Pop Singles chart and receiving airplay on [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] radio. The album also featured "[[Mainstreet]]" (written about Ann Arbor's Ann Street),<ref name="cst-2011">{{cite news | url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/5035003-421/seger-songs-tell-a-story.html | title=Seger songs tell a story | author=Dave Hoekstra | newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=May 5, 2011}}</ref> a {{Numero|24}} hit that emphasized Seger's [[Rock music|rock]] credibility as well as guitarist [[Pete Carr]]'s lead guitar, and "[[Rock and Roll Never Forgets]]", which peaked at {{Numero|41}} on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. ''Night Moves'' was Seger's first top-ten album in the Billboard album chart, and as of 2006 was certified at 6 million copies in the United States, making it the biggest-selling studio album of his career. The success of ''Night Moves'' also bolstered sales of Seger's previous releases. Seger's 1975 release ''Beautiful Loser'' would eventually sell two million copies and the 1976 album ''Live Bullet'' would go on to sell six million copies in the United States. 

In February 1977, Silver Bullet Band drummer Charlie Allen Martin was hit by a car from behind while walking on a service road and was left unable to walk.<ref>{{cite news|last=Erickson|first=Anne|title=VSA celebrates 30 years of helping disabled people become artists|url=https://www.theoaklandpress.com/entertainment/vsa-celebrates-years-of-helping-disabled-people-become-artists/article_0b644ff1-b4dc-5365-aeea-1c16b6deb9dc.html|website=Oakland Press|date=October 20, 2016}}</ref> David Teegarden, previous drummer for Seger on his 1972 album ''[[Smokin' O.P.'s]]'' was his replacement. 

The 1978 album ''[[Stranger in Town (album)|Stranger in Town]]'' was a success. The first single, "[[Still the Same (Bob Seger song)|Still the Same]]", reached {{Numero|4}} on the ''Billboard Hot 100''. "[[Hollywood Nights (song)|Hollywood Nights]]" reached {{Numero|12}}, and the ballad "[[We've Got Tonite|We've Got Tonight]]" reached {{Numero|13}}. "We've Got Tonight" was a major hit again when it was covered in 1983 by [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Sheena Easton]]. Notably, it topped ''Billboard's'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and peaked at {{Numero|2}} and {{Numero|6}} on ''Billboard's'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] and [[Hot 100]] charts respectively.  "[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]", a song from George Jackson and Thomas E. Jones III that Seger substantially rewrote the lyrics for,<ref name="cst-2011"/><ref>K. Sharp, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'', Issue 102, page 59. Future Publishing, 2007.</ref> peaked at {{Numero|28}} on the Hot 100, but achieved greater popularity after being featured in the [[Tom Cruise]] film ''[[Risky Business]]'', in which Cruise's character dances in his underwear to the song. It has since been ranked the second-most played Jukebox Single of all time, behind [[Patsy Cline]]'s "[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]".<ref name="cst-2011"/> "Old Time Rock and Roll" was named one of the [[Songs of the Century]] in 2001. Seger later remarked that not taking one-third of writing credit on his recording was, financially, "the dumbest thing I ever did".<ref name="cst-2011"/>

Seger also co-wrote the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' {{Numero|1}} hit "[[Heartache Tonight]]" from their 1979 album ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]'';<ref name="cst-2011"/> a collaboration about Seger's and [[Glenn Frey]]'s shared early lives in Detroit.

In 1980, Seger released ''[[Against the Wind (album)|Against the Wind]]'' (with ex-[[Grand Funk Railroad]] member [[Craig Frost]] replacing Robyn Robbins on keyboards) and it became his first and only {{Numero|1}} album on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' album chart. The first single "[[Fire Lake]]" featured Eagles [[Don Henley]], [[Timothy B. Schmit]], and [[Glenn Frey]] on backing vocals and Muscle Shoals guitarist [[Pete Carr]] on 12-string acoustic.  Fire Lake reached {{Numero|6}} on the Hot 100, while the title song "[[Against the Wind (Bob Seger song)|Against the Wind]]" reached {{Numero|5}} and crossed over to the Top 10 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. "[[You'll Accompany Me]]" became the third hit single from the record, reaching {{Numero|14}}. ''Against the Wind'' would also win two [[Grammy Awards]]. As of 2006, both ''Stranger in Town'' and ''Against the Wind'' had sold over 5 million copies each in the United States.

The live 1981 album ''[[Nine Tonight]]'' encapsulated this three-album peak of Seger's commercial career. Seger's take on Eugene Williams' "[[Tryin' to Live My Life Without You]]" became a Top Five hit from ''Nine Tonight'' and the album would go on to sell 4 million copies.

Seger released the acclaimed ''[[The Distance (Bob Seger album)|The Distance]]'' in December 1982. During the recording of this album, Silver Bullet guitarist Drew Abbott left due to his frustration with Seger's frequent use of session musicians and was replaced by [[Dawayne Bailey]]. After the album's release, David Teegarden also left due to internal conflict and was replaced by ex-[[Grand Funk]] drummer [[Don Brewer]]. Critically praised for representing a more versatile sound than that of his recent material, ''The Distance'' spawned numerous hits beginning with [[Rodney Crowell]]'s "[[Shame on the Moon]]". It was the biggest hit of the Silver Bullet Band's entire career, hitting {{Numero|1}} on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart and holding at {{Numero|2}} for four consecutive weeks – behind [[Patti Austin]] and [[James Ingram]]'s "[[Baby, Come to Me (Patti Austin and James Ingram song)|Baby, Come to Me]]" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Billie Jean]]" – on the Hot 100. It also crossed over to {{Numero|15}} on ''Billboard''{{'s}} [[Hot Country Songs|Country Singles]] chart. The follow-up, "Even Now", just missed the Top 10, and "[[Roll Me Away]]" peaked at {{Numero|27}}. The driving album track "Making Thunderbirds" was a popular music video filmed in Detroit and was well-received on [[MTV]]. Seger's multi-platinum sales dropped off at this point, however, with ''The Distance'' peaking at {{Numero|5}} and selling 1.9 million copies in the United States. ''The Distance'' was belatedly released on [[8-track tape]]; Capitol reportedly had no plans to do so, but Seger, claiming that many of his fans still used 8-track players in their vehicles, requested that the label also release the album in the waning format.

In 1984, Seger wrote and recorded the power rock ballad "Understanding" for the soundtrack of ''[[Teachers (film)|Teachers]]''. The song was a Top 20 hit, and in 1986, he wrote and recorded "Living Inside My Heart" for the soundtrack of ''[[About Last Night (1986 film)|About Last Night...]]''.

Seger was no longer prolific, and several years elapsed until his next studio album, ''[[Like a Rock]]'', emerged in 1986. The fast-paced "American Storm" was another Top-20 hit aided by a popular music video featuring [[Lesley Ann Warren]], and the title cut followed, reaching {{Numero|12}} on Billboard's Hot 100. Later, it became familiar through its association with a long-running [[Chevrolet]] [[ad campaign]] (something Seger explicitly chose to do to support struggling American automobile workers in Detroit).<ref>{{cite news | author=Roger Catlin | date=April 12, 1996 | newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]] | title=Bob Seger's back – with his kids }}</ref> Seger's 1986–1987 American Storm Tour was his self-stated last major tour, playing 105 shows over nine months and selling almost 1.5 million tickets. ''Like a Rock'' reached {{Numero|3}} and eventually sold over three million copies, although it has never been certified above platinum.

On March 13, 1987, Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for their contributions to the music industry; it is located at 1750 [[Vine Street]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bob-seger-and-the-silver-bullet-band|title=Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=June 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000693/1987|title=Walk of Fame (1987)|website=[[IMDb]]|access-date=June 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/bob-seger-the-silver-bullet-band/|title=Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=June 12, 2016}}</ref>

In 1987, Seger recorded "[[Shakedown (Bob Seger song)|Shakedown]]" for the soundtrack to ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''. A synth-driven pop-rock song, it was Seger's first and only {{Numero|1}} hit on the pop singles chart. The song had originally been intended for fellow Detroiter [[Glenn Frey]], but when Frey lost his voice just before the recording session, he asked Seger to take his place. Seger changed the verses but kept the chorus as it was. Seger received an Oscar nomination as co-writer in the Best Original Song category the following year.

== Later years: 1988–present ==
Seger's next record was 1991's ''[[The Fire Inside (Bob Seger album)|The Fire Inside]]'', at a time when [[glam metal]], [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]] were at the forefront. His new music found little viability on radio or elsewhere. The same was true of 1995's ''[[It's a Mystery]]'', although it was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] (500,000 copies sold). But in 1994, Seger released ''[[Greatest Hits (Bob Seger album)|Greatest Hits]]''.  The compilation was his biggest-ever record in terms of sales, selling nearly 10 million copies in the United States {{as of|2010|lc=y}}. Seger went out for a 1996 tour, which sold the fourth-largest number of tickets of any North American tour that year. 

He took a sabbatical from the music business from 1997 to 2005 to spend time with his wife and children. In 2001, and again in 2002, he won the prestigious [[Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race]] aboard his {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=on}} sailboat ''Lightning''. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on March 15, 2004. Fellow Detroiter [[Kid Rock]] gave the induction speech and Michigan Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]] proclaimed the date Bob Seger Day in his honor. In 2005, Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/85-bob-seger-a-the-silver-bullet-band|title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends - Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band|website= www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com}}</ref> and Seger was featured singing with [[3 Doors Down]] on the song "[[Landing in London]]" from their ''[[Seventeen Days]]'' album.

Seger's first new album in eleven years, ''[[Face the Promise]]'', was released in 2006. In its first 45 days, it sold over 400,000 copies<ref>According to [[Soundscan]].</ref> and went on to sell 1.2 million, returning Seger to platinum status and staying on the ''Billboard'' chart for several months. The supporting tour was eagerly anticipated, with many shows selling out within minutes. Showing that his legendary appeal in Michigan was undiminished, all 10,834 tickets available for his first show at Grand Rapids' [[Van Andel Arena]] sold out in under five minutes; three additional shows were subsequently added, each of which also sold out.

In 2009, Seger released a compilation album, ''[[Early Seger Vol. 1]]'', containing archival material from the 1970s and 1980s, including some fully or partially re-recorded tracks from ''Smokin' O.P.'s'' (1972) and ''Seven'' (1974), and some never-before-released songs.<ref>{{cite news| last = Graff| first = Gary| title = New Seger Album Cover Revealed| publisher = [[WCSX]]| date = October 26, 2009| url = http://www.wcsx.com/news/Story.aspx?ID=1155281| access-date = October 31, 2009| author-link = Gary Graff| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110809233654/http://www.wcsx.com/news/Story.aspx?ID=1155281| archive-date = August 9, 2011| df = mdy-all}}</ref> The album was initially only available for purchase at [[Meijer]] stores and then later for download at his website.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 30, 2009 |title=Early Seger Vol. 1 |url=http://bobseger.com/discography/index/album/albumId/22/tagName/Albums |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923113929/http://bobseger.com/discography/index/album/albumId/22/tagName/Albums |archive-date=September 23, 2010 |access-date=October 31, 2009 |publisher=BobSeger.com }}</ref>

On December 22, 2016, Seger performed "[[Heartache Tonight]]" as the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] honored the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. A few weeks later, on January 18, 2017, Seger gave away the single "Glenn Song" on his website as a tribute marking the first anniversary of the death of Eagles founding member [[Glenn Frey]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/premieres/hear-bob-segers-new-tribute-song-to-glenn-frey-w461128|title=Hear Bob Seger's New Tribute Song to Glenn Frey|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref> That summer, Seger embarked on his ''Runaway Train'' tour, including a show at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], the last event to be held at that venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bulletclub.bobseger.com/|title=Bob Seger > Tickets and Concert Tour Dates > Tours > 2017|website=Bulletclub.bobseger.com|access-date=November 17, 2017}}</ref> Seger released a cover of the [[Lou Reed]] song "Busload of Faith" as the first single from the ''[[I Knew You When (album)|I Knew You When]]'' album.<ref name="billboard2">{{cite magazine

==Personal life==
Seger's first marriage to Renee Andrietti in 1968 lasted for "one day short of a year". He had a long-term relationship with Jan Dinsdale from 1972 until 1983. In 1987, he married actress Annette Sinclair and they divorced one year later. He married Juanita Dorricott in 1993, in a small private setting at The Village Club, in Bloomfield Hills; they have two children.<ref name="SegFile">{{cite web|url=http://www.segerfile.com/biocont.html|title=Seger File: Biographical Notes, Part 2|publisher=Segerfile.com|access-date=October 14, 2014|archive-date=August 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829043414/http://www.segerfile.com/biocont.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Views===
Politically, Seger has characterized himself as a [[centrist]]: "[I'm] right down the middle", he remarked. He supported Democrat [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2015/11/18/bob-seger-new-album-tour-billboard-legend-live-detroit-rock/75995298/|title=Bob Seger says he'll tour in 2016; supports Hillary|date=November 18, 2015|work=[[The Detroit News]]|access-date=June 20, 2017|author= Susan Whitall}}</ref> He tackled antiestablishment themes in early songs such as "[[2 + 2 = ?]]" (1968) and "U.M.C. (Upper Middle Class)" (1974), according to Brian McCollum of the ''Detroit Free Press''. On his 2014 album ''[[Ride Out (album)|Ride Out]]'', he addressed topics such as gun violence and wrote "It's Your World" about [[climate change]]. On the subject, he said, "There are a lot of culprits in climate change, and everybody's responsible, myself included. Nobody gets a free pass on this one. We've got to change our ways and change them fast."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2014/10/12/seger-interview-new-album-tour/17051537/|title=Bob Seger gets feisty and reflective on new album|date=October 14, 2014|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|access-date=June 20, 2017|author=Brian McCollum}}</ref>
