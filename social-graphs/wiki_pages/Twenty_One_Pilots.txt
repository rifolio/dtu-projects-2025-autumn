'''Twenty One Pilots'''{{efn|Stylized in [[all lowercase]] as '''twenty one pilots''', '''twenty øne piløts''' or '''twenty {{!}} one {{!}} pilots''', and abbreviated similarly ('''tøp''' or '''TØP''')<ref name="AMbio"/>}} is an American musical duo from [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Initially a band, the group was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist [[Tyler Joseph]] along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, who both left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Tyler Joseph and drummer [[Josh Dun]]. The duo is best known for their singles "[[Stressed Out]]", "[[Ride (Twenty One Pilots song)|Ride]]", and "[[Heathens (Twenty One Pilots song)|Heathens]]", which achieved commercial success between 2015 and 2016. The duo received a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]] for "Stressed Out".

The band independently released two albums, ''[[Twenty One Pilots (album)|Twenty One Pilots]]'' (2009) and ''[[Regional at Best]]'' (2011), before being signed by record label [[Fueled by Ramen]] in 2012. Their label debut ''[[Vessel (Twenty One Pilots album)|Vessel]]'' (2013) became the second album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification.

The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, ''[[Blurryface]]'' (2015), which produced the hit singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride" and became the first album on which every track received at least a [[RIAA certification|gold certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The release of "Heathens" also made the group the first alternative artist in history to have two concurrent top five singles in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the third rock act in history to have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, joining [[the Beatles]] and [[Elvis Presley]].

The duo have released four more studio albums, ''[[Trench (album)|Trench]]'' (2018), ''[[Scaled and Icy]]'' (2021), ''[[Clancy (album)|Clancy]]'' (2024), and ''[[Breach (Twenty One Pilots album)|Breach]]'' (2025). They have also garnered 12 number-one songs on the [[Alternative Airplay]] chart, tying with [[Foo Fighters]] for the fifth-most.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Koltan|last=Greenwood|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/twenty-one-pliots-quickly-achieve-chart-feat/|title=Twenty One Pilots are the first to achieve this chart feat in two years.|magazine=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|date=May 6, 2020|access-date=March 7, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220401092026/https://www.altpress.com/news/twenty-one-pliots-quickly-achieve-chart-feat/|archive-date=April 1, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Kevin|last=Rutherford|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/twenty-one-pilots-the-contract-number-1-alternative-airplay-1236030495/|title=Twenty One Pilots Score 12th Alternative Airplay No. 1 With 'The Contract'|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 25, 2025|access-date=August 19, 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250725173032/https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/twenty-one-pilots-the-contract-number-1-alternative-airplay-1236030495/|archive-date=July 25, 2025|url-status=live}}</ref>

Joseph began playing music after finding an old keyboard inside his closet, a Christmas gift he received from his mother, and began mimicking radio melodies.<ref>{{cite web|first=Chris|last=DeVille|url=http://www.columbusalive.com/content/blogs/sensory-overload/2012/04/interview-twenty-one-pilots-part-1.html|title=Interview: Twenty One Pilots, part 1|work=[[Columbus Alive]]|date=April 27, 2012|access-date=June 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714190259/http://www.columbusalive.com/content/blogs/sensory-overload/2012/04/interview-twenty-one-pilots-part-1.html|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Messiah">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61WpOTdThzY|title=MessiahPulse Interview: Twenty One Pilots|date=February 13, 2014 |via=YouTube|access-date=June 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608074736/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61WpOTdThzY|archive-date=June 8, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2007, Joseph released a solo EP, ''No Phun Intended'', in his parents' basement. Thomas contributed guitar to several songs on the album,<ref name="Episode 10 - Nick Thomas"/> and collaborated with Joseph on the track "Trees".<ref name="Episode 10 - Nick Thomas"/>

While attending [[Ohio State University]], Joseph met [[Texas]]-born future bandmate Chris Salih at a party. Noting the songwriter's talent and creative energy, Salih consulted Joseph about starting a band. Impressed by the recording studio Salih had built in his house, Joseph agreed to play music together and began sharing his ideas for new music. Just before their first performance, Joseph invited Thomas to join the unnamed band as a bassist. In 2009, the group moved into a house of their own, where their first album was conceptualized and recorded in the basement.<ref name="Episode 10 - Nick Thomas"/><ref name="altpress.com">{{cite magazine|first=Jordan|last=Toney|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/twenty_one_pilots_chris_salih_interview_stream|title=Founding Twenty One Pilots member Chris Salih opens up about band|magazine=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|date=August 24, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429070240/https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/twenty_one_pilots_chris_salih_interview_stream|archive-date=April 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The band initially played for a wide variety of audiences at clubs and venues around the Columbus area. Playing at metal, hardcore, and electronic venues influenced Joseph to incorporate these disparate styles into his songwriting. To catch the attention of unfamiliar or uninterested attendees and promoters, the band began to experiment with costumes and on-stage [[acrobatics]].<ref name="altpress.com"/>

Now going by the name Twenty One Pilots,<ref name="Billboard-2"/><ref name="Joy-2012"/> the group released their debut album, ''[[Twenty One Pilots (album)|Twenty One Pilots]]'', on December 29, 2009, and began touring Ohio. Their initial marketing was grassroots; Joseph's mother would stand outside of Ohio State University, giving away tickets to their shows.<ref>{{cite web|author=Shayla D|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/3508203/twenty-one-pilots-singer-tyler-joseph-discusses-how-his-hard-work-in-basketball-paid-off-in-a-successful-music-career/|title=Twenty One Pilots Singer Tyler Joseph Discusses How His Hard Work in Basketball Paid Off in a Successful Music Career|work=[[Inquisitr]]|date=September 14, 2016|access-date=December 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809153122/https://www.inquisitr.com/3508203/twenty-one-pilots-singer-tyler-joseph-discusses-how-his-hard-work-in-basketball-paid-off-in-a-successful-music-career/|archive-date=August 9, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> During this time, the band participated in various "Battle of the Band" contests at The Alrosa Villa and The Basement, important Columbus music venues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eytVsO6xi7M|title=Twenty One Pilots – Trapdoor Live @ The Battle of the Bands 10–11–09|date=November 24, 2009 |via=YouTube|access-date=February 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201122123429/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eytVsO6xi7M|archive-date=November 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggAOfa0B2xk|title=Twenty One Pilots – Friend, Please Live @ The Battle of the Bands 10–11–09|date=November 10, 2009 |via=YouTube|access-date=February 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120073504/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggAOfa0B2xk|archive-date=November 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

In November 2011, after months of cultivating a fan base in the Columbus area via social media interaction and constant touring, the band played a sold-out concert at Columbus' [[Newport Music Hall]].

Joseph, in a 2023 livestream reflecting on the lead-up to what would become ''[[Vessel (Twenty One Pilots album)|Vessel]]'', talked about signing with Fueled by Ramen and ''Regional at Best'': "it was just a record that we had on the merch table when we were performing independently, and then we wanted to go record a real, professional record when we got signed – some of those songs we took from ''Regional at Best'' and kind of re-recorded them, and some of we had written new, since then. And that's what ''Vessel'' is. I know some people might not like this, but I kind of view ''Vessel'' as our first record."<ref>{{cite web|first=Emily|last=Carter|url=https://www.kerrang.com/twenty-one-pilots-vessel-tyler-joseph-josh-dun-regional-at-best|title=twenty one pilots explain the difference between their albums Vessel and Regional At Best|work=[[Kerrang!]]|date=January 9, 2023|access-date=March 16, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230331094157/https://www.loudersound.com/news/twenty-one-pilots-ex-regrets-deleted-music|archive-date=March 31, 2023|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Regional at Best'' tracks "Slowtown", "Anathema", "Ruby", "Be Concerned", and "Clear" have since been made commercially unavailable.<ref>{{cite web|first=Martin|last=Kielty|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/twenty-one-pilots-ex-regrets-deleted-music|title=Twenty One Pilots ex regrets deleted music|work=[[Metal Hammer]]|date=August 25, 2017|access-date=February 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230331094157/https://www.loudersound.com/news/twenty-one-pilots-ex-regrets-deleted-music|archive-date=March 31, 2023|url-status=live}}</ref>
