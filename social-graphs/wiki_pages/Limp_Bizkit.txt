''' Limp Bizkit''' is an American [[nu metal]] band from [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Its lineup consists of lead vocalist [[Fred Durst]], drummer [[John Otto (drummer)|John Otto]], guitarist [[Wes Borland]], turntablist [[DJ Lethal]] and bassist [[Sam Rivers (bassist)|Sam Rivers]]. The band's musical style is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks, and uniforms, also plays a large role in Limp Bizkit's live shows. The band has been nominated for three [[Grammy Awards]], sold 40 million records worldwide, and won several other awards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://folioweekly.com/Unabashed-Aggressors,4178 |title=Unabashed Aggressors |author=McGregor, Nick |date=April 17, 2013 |publisher=Folio Weekly |access-date=April 18, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512110151/http://www.folioweekly.com/Unabashed-Aggressors%2C4178 |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The band achieved mainstream success with its second and third studio albums, ''[[Significant Other (album)|Significant Other]]'' (1999) and ''[[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]'' (2000). However, this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding its performances at [[Woodstock '99]] and the 2001 [[Big Day Out]] festival.

Borland left the group in 2001; however, Durst, Rivers, Otto, and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist [[Mike Smith (guitarist)|Mike Smith]]. Following the release of their fourth album ''[[Results May Vary]]'' (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded the EP ''[[The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)]]'' (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal, and drummer [[Sammy Siegler]] before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band once again reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album ''[[Gold Cobra]]'' (2011), after which it left Interscope and later signed with [[Cash Money Records]]; DJ Lethal quit the band soon afterward, returning in 2018. After years of teasing an album tentatively titled ''Stampede of the Disco Elephants'',<ref>{{Cite web|last=Brown|first=Paul 'Browny'|date=2021-08-25|title=New Limp Bizkit Songs AND Album Incoming VERY SOON…|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2021/08/26/new-limp-bizkit-songs-and-album-incoming-very-soon/|access-date=2021-08-26|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US|archive-date=July 18, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230718005950/https://wallofsoundau.com/2021/08/26/new-limp-bizkit-songs-and-album-incoming-very-soon/|url-status=live}}</ref> the band released its sixth studio album ''[[Still Sucks]]'' on October 31, 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=Limp Bizkit to release new album 'Limp Bizkit Still Sucks' on Halloween |url=https://nextmosh.com/limp-bizkit-still-sucks-album/ |website=NextMosh.com |date=October 29, 2021 |access-date=29 October 2021 |archive-date=July 18, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230718010048/https://nextmosh.com/limp-bizkit-still-sucks-album/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1994–1996) ===
[[File:Drummer John Otto of Limp Bizkit in 2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Otto (drummer)|John Otto]] studied [[jazz drumming]] and played in local [[avant garde music|avant garde]] bands before joining Limp Bizkit.]]
While growing up in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]], [[Fred Durst]] took an interest in [[breakdancing]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[punk rock]], and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. He began to [[rapping|rap]], [[skateboard|skate]], [[beatboxing|beatbox]], and [[disc jockey|DJ]].

While mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist, he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip hop.<ref>{{cite book |last=Devenish |first=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]] |isbn=0-312-26349-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/1 1–20] |chapter=Chapter 1 |url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/1}}</ref> Durst played with three other bands: Split 26, Malachi Sage (both of which were unsuccessful), and 10 Foot Shindig, which Durst left to form a new band.<ref name="Devenish21">{{cite book |last=Devenish |first=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=0-312-26349-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/21 21–51] |chapter=Chapter 2 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/21}}</ref> Durst told [[Sam Rivers (bassist)|Sam Rivers]], the bassist for Malachi Sage, "You need to quit this band and start a band with me that's like this: rappin' and rockin'."<ref name="Devenish21" /> Rivers suggested that [[John Otto (drummer)|John Otto]], who was studying [[jazz drumming]] at the [[Douglas Anderson School of the Arts]] and playing in local [[avant garde music|avant garde]] bands, become the band's drummer.<ref name="Devenish21" /> Durst, Rivers, and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together and after brief stints with guitarists Rob Waters and [[Terry Balsamo]], [[Wes Borland]] joined as their permanent guitarist.<ref name="Devenish21" />

Durst named the band ''Limp Bizkit'' because he wanted a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, "The name is there to turn people's heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, 'Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.' Those are the people that we don't even want listening to our music."<ref name=Devenish21/> Durst said that the band liked quirky and corny things and that they did not take themselves seriously all the time. Thus, the name "Limp Bizkit" represented these characteristics and the band as a whole.<ref>{{Citation |title=kdge.com Ef 20 Limp Bizkit Interview Part 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgb5K8N8Msw |language=en |access-date=2022-07-03 |archive-date=July 3, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220703190428/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgb5K8N8Msw |url-status=live }}</ref> Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1iry4g/i_am_fred_durst_of_limp_bizkitask_me_anything/cb7gdo0 |title=I am Fred Durst of LIMP BIZKIT ...

We gave them other options, like Funky Moses and the Red Sea Pedestrians, and 600 Pounds of Furious Pig".<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Wes Borland Quit-And Limp Bizkit's Sales Plummeted - Results May Vary |publisher=Rock N' Roll True Stories |time=1:25–1:31 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZxWQhmZYYQ&t=85s |via=YouTube |access-date=2025-05-26}} At 1:25–1:31, the video displays a screenshot of a newspaper article titled "Limp Bizkit: Stupid name, but that's the point," written by John Serba of ''The Grand Rapids Press''.</ref>

Limp Bizkit developed a [[cult following]] in the [[underground music]] scene, particularly at the Milk Bar, an underground punk club in Jacksonville. The band's local popularity was such that [[Sugar Ray]], who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group [[Funkdoobiest]].<ref name="Devenish21" /> Milkbar owner Danny Wimmer stated that Limp Bizkit "had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred ... was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools."<ref name="Devenish21" /> However, the band knew that to achieve national success, it would have to distinguish themselves in its live performances.<ref name="Devenish21" /> Attracting crowds by [[word of mouth]], the band gave energetic live performances, covering [[George Michael]]'s "[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]" and [[Paula Abdul]]'s "[[Straight Up (Paula Abdul song)|Straight Up]]" and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes.<ref name="Devenish21" /> Borland's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.<ref name="Devenish21" />

Durst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A&R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band's manager.<ref name="Devenish21" /> Later when [[Korn]] performed in town as the opening act for [[Sick of It All]], Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst's tattoos were unimpressive, he was able to persuade [[Reginald Arvizu|Reginald "Fieldy" Arvizu]] to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs "Pollution", "[[Counterfeit (song)|Counterfeit]]", and "Stalemate". Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which exposed the band to a new audience.<ref name="Devenish21" /><ref name="amg">{{cite web |last=Bush |first=John |title=Limp Bizkit&nbsp;– Biography |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p213327/biography|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=AllMusic |year=2006 |access-date=January 27, 2008}}</ref> The band attempted to expand its sound by auditioning an additional guitarist, but Borland soon determined that another guitarist was not the answer and [[DJ Lethal]], formerly of the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[House of Pain]], joined the band as a [[turntablist]] after a successful practice performance.<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=265}}</ref> Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band's style. Due to creative differences, Borland left the band at this point.<ref name="Devenish21" />

=== Record label deals and ''Three Dollar Bill, Y'all'' (1997–1998) ===

[[File:Fred Durst at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival.JPG|thumb|upright|Following the release of ''[[Three Dollar Bill, Y'all]]'', vocalist Fred Durst was appointed senior vice president of A&R at Interscope]]
After its performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood was well received, Limp Bizkit were offered a record deal with the [[Los Angeles]]-based independent label [[Flip Records (1994)|Flip Records]], who attempted to sign the band for $50,000.<ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine |last1=Daly |first1=Steven |date=1999-08-05 |title=Send Porn Stars, Funk and Money: The Limp Bizkit Story |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/send-porn-stars-funk-and-money-the-limp-bizkit-story-181005/ |access-date=2022-10-30 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US |archive-date=October 30, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221030152251/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/send-porn-stars-funk-and-money-the-limp-bizkit-story-181005/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Soon after that, however, they were also offered a record deal with the major label [[Mojo Records|Mojo]], a subsidiary of [[MCA Records]]. According to Flip Records' founder [[Jordan Schur]], Limp Bizkit stated that the only way the band would not sign with Mojo was if the band's van flipped over on the way to Los Angeles.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Weingarten |first=Marc |date=1999-04-18 |title=Anything But Stale |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-apr-18-ca-28440-story.html |access-date=2022-10-30 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US |archive-date=October 28, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221028080929/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-apr-18-ca-28440-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

While heading to California to record its first album, the band's van flipped over five times, resulting in all of the band's members sustaining serious injuries. As a result of the near-death experience, Durst made amends with Borland, who rejoined the band.<ref name="Devenish21" /><ref name=":0" /> The accident also strained the band's relationship with Mojo, who Durst felt wanted the band to resume working prematurely, resulting in Schur buying out the band's record and management contract and signing the band to Flip, which cost him $175,000.<ref name="LarkinHR" /><ref name=":0" />

Arvizu persuaded [[Ross Robinson]] to listen to the demo. Robinson neglected to listen to it until it was appraised by his girlfriend. Impressed by the band's motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit's debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song "Sour".<ref name="Devenish21" /> The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, "Everything".<ref name="Devenish21" /> Schur bankrolled the recording sessions for the album, and following its completion negotiated a 50/50 agreement with [[Interscope Records]] to distribute the album.<ref name=":1" />

Despite the success of live performances of the band's cover of the song "Faith", Robinson was opposed to recording it and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming as well as DJ scratching, impressed him.<ref name="Devenish21" /> Robinson also bonded with Borland, who he perceived as not taking the band seriously.<ref name="Devenish21" /> The [[progressive metal]] band [[Tool (band)|Tool]] provided a strong influence in shaping the album's sound, particularly in the song "Nobody Loves Me", which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of [[Maynard James Keenan]].<ref name="Devenish21" />

Continuing the band's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, Limp Bizkit named the album by using part of the phrase "queer as a three dollar bill" and adding the word "Y'all" for Florida flavor, titling it ''[[Three Dollar Bill, Y'all]]''.<ref name="Devenish21" /> The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to its music.<ref name="Devenish21" />

After the band completed recording, they toured with Korn and [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]] in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'' music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst's performance, stating "The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit's [[Rap metal|rap/thrash]] show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for [[Homosexuality|gay]] men to be 'stomped'. Which isn't remotely rebellious. It's just puerile."<ref name="Devenish21" /> That same year, they also notably served as an opening act on the [[Album of the Year Tour]] for [[Faith No More]], a band often credited as paving the way for Limp Bizkit and the [[nu metal]] genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/2015/8/13/they-did-it-all-for-the-nookie-decibel-explores-the-rise-and-fall-of-nu-metal|title=They Did It All for the Nookie: Decibel Explores the Rise and Fall of Nu-Metal|date=August 13, 2015|access-date=January 18, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226193814/http://decibelmagazine.com/blog/2015/8/13/they-did-it-all-for-the-nookie-decibel-explores-the-rise-and-fall-of-nu-metal/|archive-date=February 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They were subject to a hostile reception from Faith No More's fans,<ref name="toomey">Borland, Wes. 2017.

Interscope proposed to the band that the label pay $5,000 to guarantee that a [[Portland, Oregon]], radio station play the song "Counterfeit" fifty times, preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope.<ref name="Devenish51">{{cite book |last=Devenish |first=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=0-312-26349-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/51 51–78] |chapter=Chapter 3 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/51}}</ref><ref name="MTVJuly1998">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431305/limp-bizkit-pays-counterfeit-play.jhtml |title=Limp Bizkit Pays For 'Counterfeit' Play |date=July 1, 1998 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |access-date=December 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115235506/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431305/limp-bizkit-pays-counterfeit-play.jhtml |archive-date=January 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The paid air time was criticized by the media, who saw it as "[[payola]]".<ref name="Devenish51" /><ref name="MTVJuly1998" /> The band's manager Jeff Kwatinetz later termed the plan as a "brilliant marketing move".<ref name="Devenish51" /> Durst stated, "It worked, but it's not that cool of a thing."<ref name="Devenish51" />

Following the release of "Counterfeit" as a single, ''Three Dollar Bill, Yall'' was released on July 1, 1997, and was met with minimal response.<ref name="LarkinHR" /> [[AllMusic]] writer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] wrote, "They might not have many original ideas ... but they do the sound well.

Limp Bizkit joined the [[Warped Tour]], performing alongside the bands [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], Sick of It All, [[Lagwagon]], and [[Blink-182]].<ref name="Devenish51" /> Preceding the band's first tour with DJ Lethal, Otto became familiar with Lethal's contributions to collaborate with him better on stage.<ref name="Devenish51" /> In addition to touring with [[Primus (band)|Primus]] and [[Deftones]], Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour, which was intended to diversify the band's largely male fanbase by offering free tickets to female attendees. This plan successfully increased the band's female fanbase.<ref name="Devenish51" />

In 1998, Limp Bizkit toured with [[Soulfly]] and [[Cold (band)|Cold]] on Soulfly's first European tour.<ref name="Devenish51" /> Touring consistently increased Limp Bizkit's success and the second single from ''Three Dollar Bill, Y'all'', a cover of George Michael's "Faith", became a successful radio hit, leading to a slot on [[Ozzfest]], a tour organized by [[Ozzy Osbourne|Ozzy]] and [[Sharon Osbourne]].<ref name="Devenish51" /> In July, [[Snot (band)|Snot]] singer [[Lynn Strait]] was arrested after he emerged nude from Limp Bizkit's prop toilet, and was charged with indecent exposure.<ref name="Devenish51" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Snot Singer Charged With Indecent Exposure |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432993/07101998/snot.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=July 10, 1998 |access-date=January 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219220343/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432993/07101998/snot.jhtml |archive-date=December 19, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Because Limp Bizkit's fans would often break through the barricades, the band was almost kicked off the tour after two days.<ref name="Devenish51" /> In August, John Otto spent the night in jail in Auburn Hills, Michigan on a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon after allegedly firing a [[BB gun]] and being arrested for carrying a switchblade.<ref name="Devenish51" />

After completing Ozzfest, Limp Bizkit took a break from performing and later performed on Korn's [[Family Values Tour]]. Durst also directed a music video for the band's single "Faith" in promotion for its appearance in the film ''[[Very Bad Things]]'', but was unsatisfied with it and directed a second video which paid tribute to tourmates like Primus, Deftones, and Korn, who appeared in the video.<ref name="Devenish51" /> Borland stated in an interview that George Michael, the song's writer, hated the cover and "hates us for doing it".<ref name="Devenish51" />

Following the radio success of "Faith", the band was determined to record the follow-up to its first album in order to show that they were not a Korn soundalike or a cover band; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from its newfound fame.<ref name=Devenish79/> [[Terry Date]], who had produced albums for [[Pantera]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]] and [[Deftones]], was chosen to produce the album.<ref name=Devenish95>{{cite book |last=Devenish |first=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=0-312-26349-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/95 95–113] |chapter=Chapter 4 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/95}}</ref> The band allowed Durst and Lethal to explore their hip hop origins by recording a song with [[Method Man]]. The song was originally titled "Shut the Fuck Up", but was retitled "[[N 2 Gether Now]]" for marketing purposes.<ref name=Devenish95/> Durst also recorded with [[Eminem]], but the collaboration, "Turn Me Loose", was left off the album.<ref name=Devenish95/> The album also featured guest appearances by [[Stone Temple Pilots]] singer [[Scott Weiland]], Korn's [[Jonathan Davis]], [[Staind]] singer [[Aaron Lewis]], and interludes by [[Les Claypool]] and [[Matt Pinfield]].<ref name=Devenish95/>

''[[Significant Other (album)|Significant Other]]'' saw Limp Bizkit reaching a new level of commercial success; the band was featured on the covers of popular music magazines including ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' and now found themselves repeatedly mobbed for autographs; the band was allowed to interact directly with its fans on a website established by Dike 99.<ref name=Devenish115/> Durst also moved from Jacksonville to Los Angeles. ''Significant Other'' was seen as an improvement over its debut and was generally well received by critics with mixed-to-positive reviews. However, the band also continued to be criticized by the media; an article profiling the band in ''Spin'' and discussing ''Significant Other'' claimed that "Limp Bizkit had yet to write a good song", and musicians [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Trent Reznor]] criticized the band.<ref name=Devenish115>{{cite book |last=Devenish |first=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=0-312-26349-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/115 115–125] |chapter=Chapter 5 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/115}}</ref>

The band promoted the album by playing unannounced concerts in Detroit and Chicago as radio stations received a strong number of requests for the album's first single, "[[Nookie (Limp Bizkit song)|Nookie]]".<ref name=Devenish127>{{cite book |last=Devenish |first=Colin |title=Limp Bizkit |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=0-312-26349-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/127 127–153] |chapter=Chapter 6 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/limpbizkit0000deve/page/127}}</ref> ''Significant Other'' climbed to No.&nbsp;1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]], selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release.<ref name=Devenish127/> In its second week of release the album sold an additional 335,000 copies.<ref name=Devenish127/>

On the opening night of the band's Limptropolis tour with [[Kid Rock]], Sam Rivers smashed his bass in frustration over the venue's poor sound, cutting his hand. After his hand was stitched up at a hospital, Rivers returned to finish the set.<ref name="Devenish127" /> On July 12, Durst allegedly kicked a security guard in the head during a performance in St. Paul, Minnesota and was later arrested on assault charges.<ref name="Devenish127" /> Further criticisms of the band appeared in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name="Devenish127" /> ''New York Times'' writer Ann Powers wrote, "DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar, riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm. John Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky, instead steering hip-hop's break-beat-based structure into a backbone for power chords. This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos, and if Mr. Durst had any talent as a singer".<ref name="Devenish127" />

In the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated [[Woodstock 1999|Woodstock '99]] show in front of approximately 200,000 people. Violent action sprang up during and after the band's performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song "[[Break Stuff]]". Several [[sexual assault]]s were also reported in the concert's aftermath .<ref name="amg" /><ref name="Devenish127" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Police Investigate Reports of Rapes at Woodstock |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/july99/woodstock29.htm |url-status=live |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 29, 1999 |access-date=July 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219071649/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/july99/woodstock29.htm |archive-date=February 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Durst stated during the concert, "People are getting hurt. Don't let anybody get hurt. But I don't think you should mellow out. That's what [[Alanis Morissette]] had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy".<ref name="Devenish127" /> Durst later stated in an interview, "I didn't see anybody getting hurt. You don't see that. When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?"<ref name="Devenish127" /> Les Claypool told ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', "Woodstock was just Durst being Durst. His attitude is 'no press is bad press', so he brings it on himself. He wallows in it. Still, he's a great guy."<ref name="Devenish127" /> [[Jonathan Davis]] of [[Korn]] also defended the band: "I think Bizkit is being blamed for it because they were the heavy band … I don't think it was their fuckin' fault".<ref name="Herman">{{Cite web |last=Herman |first=James Patrick |date=2019-08-23 |title=Fred Durst Has No Woodstock '99 Regrets: 'Limp Bizkit Is an Easy Target So Bring it On' |url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/limp-bizkit-woodstock-99-fred-durst-no-regrets-1203312851/ |access-date=2022-05-06 |website=Variety |language=en-US |archive-date=September 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210901101348/https://variety.com/2019/music/news/limp-bizkit-woodstock-99-fred-durst-no-regrets-1203312851/ |url-status=live }}</ref>  "It's easy to point the finger and blame [us], but they hired us for what we do — and all we did is what we do. I would turn the finger and point it back to the people that hired us," said Durst in reference to [[Woodstock Music and Art Fair|original Woodstock]] co-founder [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]].<ref name="Herman" />

Durst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event's controversy, and reflected on the criticisms surrounding the band in his music video for the single "[[Re-Arranged]]", which depicted the band members receiving death sentences for their participation in the concerts. The video ended with angry witnesses watching as the band drowned in milk while performing the song.<ref name="Devenish127" /> Durst later stated that the promoters of Woodstock '99 were at fault for booking his band due to their reputation for raucous performances.<ref name="Devenish127" />

Despite this controversy, ''Significant Other'' remained at No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' charts; the band also headlined the year's [[Family Values Tour 1999|Family Values Tour]].<ref name="Devenish127" /> Durst directed a music video for "N 2 Gether Now" which featured Method Man and [[Pauly Shore]], and was inspired by [[Inspector Clouseau]]'s fights with his butler [[List of The Pink Panther characters#Cato Fong|Cato Fong]] in the ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|Pink Panther]]'' film series.<ref name="Devenish127" />

=== ''Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water'' (2000–2001) ===

In 2000, Durst announced that the band's third studio album would be titled ''[[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]''. The press thought he was joking about this title.<ref name=diPerna>{{cite book |last=di Perna |first=Alan |title=Guitar World Presents Nu-Metal |chapter=Wild Wild Wes |page=[https://archive.org/details/guitarworldprese00kitt/page/104 104] |year=2002 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-634-03287-9 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/guitarworldprese00kitt/page/104}}</ref> The album title is intended to sound like a fictional band; the phrase "Chocolate Starfish" refers to the human anus and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an "asshole".<ref name=diPerna/> Borland contributed the other half of the album's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop did not have hot dog or meat-flavored water.<ref name=diPerna/>

In June 2000, Limp Bizkit performed at the [[WINS-FM|WXRK]] [[Dysfunctional Family Picnic]], but showed up an hour late for their set.<ref name=Manning>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427590/limp-creed-trade-barbs-at-krock-show.jhtml |title=Limp, Creed Trade Barbs At KROCK Show |author=Manning, Kara |date=June 26, 2000 |publisher=MTV News |access-date=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213215454/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427590/limp-creed-trade-barbs-at-krock-show.jhtml |archive-date=December 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> An Interscope spokesman stated that there was confusion over the band's set time.<ref name=Manning/> During the band's performance, Durst criticized [[Creed (band)|Creed]] singer [[Scott Stapp]], calling him "an egomaniac".<ref name=Manning/> Creed's representatives later presented Durst with an autographed anger management manual.<ref name=Manning/>

In the summer, Limp Bizkit's tour was sponsored by the controversial [[file sharing]] service [[Napster]], doing free shows with a metal cage as the only thing separating them from the audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fb0G3RI4hM |title=Limp Bizkit Top 10 Most Memorabel Moments |publisher=YouTube |date=November 19, 2009 |access-date=April 14, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217114546/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fb0G3RI4hM |archive-date=February 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Durst was an outspoken advocate of file sharing.<ref name="amg" /> They also did a "Guerrilla Tour", which involved the band setting up illegal and impromptu public gigs on rooftops and alleyways, some being shut down by the police.

During the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]], Durst performed "Livin' It Up", a song from the upcoming album, as a duet with [[Christina Aguilera]]. In response to the performance, [[Filter (band)|Filter]] frontman [[Richard Patrick]] was quoted as saying "Fred getting onstage with Christina Aguilera embarrassed us all."<ref name="MTVNewsAguilera">{{cite web |date=October 3, 2000 |title=Limp's Durst Explains Aguilera Duet |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424786/20001003/aguilera_christina.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225011804/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424786/20001003/aguilera_christina.jhtml |archive-date=December 25, 2010 |access-date=December 17, 2011 |publisher=MTV News |df=mdy-all}}</ref> In response to the negative reactions to the performance, Durst remarked, "People always just wanna talk about Britney or Christina. What's the problem? Because they make a type of music we aren't allowed to like? Or you think they are the nemesis of what our music is about? Why segregate? Why be so musically fuckin' racist? What do you mean, I can't hang out with these types of people? Clearly I didn't give a fuck, which fed a lot of it, too. I mean, someone that's not going to give in and apologise... it's gonna make people carry on talking".<ref name="Hammerpublished">{{Cite web |last=Hammerpublished |first=Metal |date=2020-08-20 |title=Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst: "I'm Dr Frankenstein and the guy in the red cap is my creature" |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/limp-bizkit-the-gospel-according-to-fred-durst |access-date=2022-05-06 |website=loudersound |language=en |archive-date=September 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210901101350/https://www.loudersound.com/features/limp-bizkit-the-gospel-according-to-fred-durst |url-status=live }}</ref>

Durst also appeared in the music video for Eminem's song "[[The Real Slim Shady]]", a song in which [[Eminem]] suggests that Christina Aguilera and Durst had a sexual relationship. Durst denied the rumors and defended Aguilera, saying: "For one thing, it's not true, so it doesn't bother me. [Eminem is] sort of answering the critics. He's going to the extreme with everything he can to now slap them in the face.... It's so over-the-top. For one thing, Christina's amazing. I really like that girl. I think she's an amazing singer. She's gonna have longevity. She's going to be one of those amazing icon women. I'm really attracted to her, I like her, and I've talked to her a couple of times, and that's that.

During a 2001 tour of Australia at the [[Big Day Out]] festival in Sydney, fans rushed the stage in the [[moshing|mosh pit]] and teenager [[Jessica Michalik]] died of [[asphyxiation]]. In court, Durst, represented by long-time attorney Ed McPherson, testified he had warned the concert's organizers Aaron Jackson, Will Pearce, and Amar Tailor, as well as the concert's promoter Vivian Lees, of the potential dangers of such minimal security.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1148637.stm | work=BBC News | title=Limp Bizkit 'devastated' by fan death | date=February 1, 2001 | access-date=April 4, 2010 | archive-date=June 5, 2004 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040605235934/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1148637.stm | url-status=live }}</ref> After viewing videotapes and hearing witness testimony, however, the coroner said it was evident that the crowd's density was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage, stating that Fred Durst should have acted more responsibly when the problem became apparent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458584/aussie-court-easy-on-bizkit.jhtml |title=Organizers Blamed In Limp Bizkit Mosh-Pit Death |author=D'Angelo, Joe |date=November 8, 2002 |publisher=MTV News |access-date=December 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624013516/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458584/aussie-court-easy-on-bizkit.jhtml |archive-date=June 24, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Durst stated that he was "emotionally scarred" because of the teenager's death.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/17/1023864403550.html |author=Glendinning, Lee |work=The Age |location=Melbourne, Australia |title=Limp Bizkit singer tells of emotional scars from Big Day Out tragedy |date=June 18, 2002 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519185052/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/17/1023864403550.html |archive-date=May 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Durst also stated that he was aware of the security problems, but that he and the band were forced to play in the festival: "There was a demand for us to play Big Day Out 2001, so we filled it.

And we go, "No, you gotta have the right barricade." The promoters who owned Big Day Out at the time were rude. The police came and it turned into this huge thing, with them telling us, "There's gonna be a riot if you don't play and if that happens, we're arresting you".<ref name="Hammerpublished" />

Later in 2001, numerous hip-hop artists including [[P. Diddy]], [[Timbaland]], [[Bubba Sparxxx]], and [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] remixed famous songs from the band into hip-hop versions, adding their own styles and modifications. The album was called ''[[New Old Songs]]''.

=== Departure of Borland and ''Results May Vary'' (2001–2003) ===

In October 2001, Durst released a statement on their website stating that "Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have amicably decided to part ways.

Limp Bizkit performed at [[WWE WrestleMania XIX]], with both Smith and Korn's [[Brian Welch]] on guitars. In the summer of 2003, Limp Bizkit participated on the [[Summer Sanitarium Tour]] headlined by [[Metallica]].<ref name=Kaufman/> At the tour's [[Chicago]] stop, concert attendees threw items and heckled Durst from the moment he walked on stage. With the crowd chanting "Fuck Fred Durst" and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back. He repeatedly said, "Limp Bizkit are the best band in the world!" until a roadie took his microphone away.<ref name=Kaufman>{{cite web |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1474912/20030728/limp_bizkit.jhtml |title=Limp Bizkit Walk Offstage After Chicago Crowd Gets Hostile – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=July 28, 2003 |access-date=July 21, 2011 |archive-date=February 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210105747/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1474912/20030728/limp_bizkit.jhtml }}</ref> An article in the ''Sun-Times'' stated that the hostility was started by radio personality [[Mancow]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Susman |first=Gary |url=https://ew.com/article/2003/07/29/chicago-concertgoers-boo-bizkit-stage/ |title=Throw Stuff |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 29, 2003 |access-date=July 21, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022054444/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,471517,00.html |archive-date=October 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In May, ''The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)'' was released. [[Sammy Siegler]] took over drumming duties for the band for much of the EP, which featured a more experimental sound, described by AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as "neo-prog alt-metal".<ref name=ErlewineUnquestionableTruth/> At Durst's insistence, the EP was released as an underground release without any advertising or promotion.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1514094/20051118/limp_bizkit.jhtml] {{dead link|date=November 2023|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name=Harris>{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Chris |title=Bye Bye Bizkit?

The EP received mixed reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the music, calling it "a step in the right direction – it's more ambitious, dramatic, and aggressive, built on pummeling verses and stop-start choruses." However, he felt that the band was being "held back" by Durst, whom he called "the most singularly unpleasant, absurd frontman in rock."<ref name=ErlewineUnquestionableTruth/> [[IGN]] writer Spence D. similarly gave it a mixed review, as he felt that the EP lacked direction, but that showed potential for the band's musical growth.<ref name=SpenceD>{{cite web|title=Limp Bizkit – The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/609/609754p1.html|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]|date=May 3, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403105511/http://music.ign.com/articles/609/609754p1.html|archive-date=April 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Borland provided an album update in June 2021, detailing the struggles with the album: {{blockquote|We've probably, in the last 10 years, been in the studio to try and complete the record, I wanna say, seven times, to different studios.

Limp Bizkit's music is noted for its "kinetic, frenzied energy".<ref name=ErlewineThreeDollarBill/> Otto is adept in drumming in a variety of styles ranging from [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian]] and [[Afro-Cuban music]] to [[bebop]] and [[funk]].<ref name=Devenish21/> DJ Lethal functions as a [[sound design]]er for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, "I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. ... It's all different stuff that you haven't heard before. I'm trying to be like another guitar player."<ref name=Devenish21/> Borland's guitar playing is experimental and nontraditional, and he is noted for his creative use of six and [[seven-string guitar]]s.<ref name=KittsTolinski/> ''Three Dollar Bill, Yall'' features him playing without a [[guitar pick]], performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions.<ref name=Devenish21/> His guitar playing has made use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound.<ref name=HurwitzRiley>{{cite book |last1=Hurwitz |first1=Tobias |last2=Riley |first2=Glenn |title=7-String Guitar |date=June 1, 2002 |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |isbn=0-7390-2807-3 |pages=30–32 |chapter=Rhythm guitar riffs in the style of Wes Borland}}</ref> Borland has also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning [[Lick (music)|licks]].<ref name=HurwitzRiley/> The song "Stuck" uses a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar.<ref name=HurwitzRiley/>

AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the band's album ''Significant Other'' contains "flourishes of [[neo-psychedelia]] on pummeling metal numbers" and "swirls of [[Strings (music)|strings]], even [[crooning]], at the most unexpected background".<ref>{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/significant-other-r421388/review |title=''Significant Other'' – Limp Bizkit |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=December 17, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113060953/http://allmusic.com/album/significant-other-r421388/review |archive-date=November 13, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The band did not employ [[Solo (music)|solos]] until ''Gold Cobra'' (except for the song "Underneath the Gun" from ''Results May Vary''), however, during the recording of ''Significant Other'', drummer John Otto performed an extended solo in the middle of the song "Nobody Like You".<ref name=Devenish95/> A drum solo can also be heard on "9 Teen 90 Nine" from the same album.

=== Live performances ===

[[File:13-06-09 RiP Limp Bizkit Wes Borland 1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Guitarist Wes Borland is known for his visual performance style, and often performs wearing costumes or body paint.]]
Guitarist Wes Borland is known for his use of costumes and [[body paint]] during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits,<ref name=Devenish21/> and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a "burnt match". Describing the character, he stated, "I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black—from the neck up—and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth."<ref name=KittsTolinski>{{cite book |last1=Kitts |first1=Jeff |last2=Tolinski |first2=Brad |title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists Of All Time |year=2002 |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn=0-634-04619-5 |pages=3–4 |chapter=Lords Of Hard Rock: Wes Borland }}</ref> Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]''.<ref name=KittsTolinski/>

In addition to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually paid tribute to the film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees.<ref name=Devenish51/> During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan "Primus sucks": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with [[the finger|middle fingers]] raised. According to Borland, "they finger us back—and you know what that means to us—that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'"<ref name=Devenish51/>

During the band's sets at Ozzfest, audience members at the tour heckled Limp Bizkit, leading the band to use a {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} toilet as a stage prop, which they would emerge from during each performance; the band punctuated their sets by "flushing" cardboard cutouts of pop stars like [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] and the [[Spice Girls]].<ref name=Devenish51/> During their appearance at the first [[Family Values Tour]], Limp Bizkit performed on a set which the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described as "a mix of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[Mars Attacks!|Mars Attacks]]''". The band emerged from a spaceship during the tour, and Borland continued to experiment with visual appearances.<ref name=Devenish51/> During the band's [[Halloween]] performance on the tour, each of the band's members dressed as [[Elvis Presley]] at various stages in his career.<ref name=Devenish51/>

==Feuds==
=== Slipknot ===
[[Korn]] and Limp Bizkit shared a long-standing friendship after bassist [[Reginald Arvizu]] assisted the latter in acquiring a record deal in 1996. The bands continued to strengthen their relationship as they often toured together frequently throughout the late 1990s. [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] at the time were an up and coming band and would have their [[Slipknot (album)|self-titled debut]] produced by [[Ross Robinson]] (a producer who worked with all three bands). Whilst on tour promoting their upcoming album during the 1999 [[Ozzfest]] tour, lead singer [[Corey Taylor]] took notice of Korn drummer [[David Silveria]]'s modeling campaign for Calvin Klein in several magazines whilst the band were at a truck stop in Texas. Disgusted with Silveria's business decisions to expand into modeling, Taylor purchased numerous copies of the magazine issue and publicly burnt copies onstage during Slipknot's live performances. According to Taylor, Durst and DJ Lethal were enraged by this and attacked Slipknot in various interviews in the spring of 1999. Taylor admits that he and multiple Slipknot members were impressed with Limp Bizkit's 1997 debut record, even citing it as an influence on their debut album, but he later claimed they lost respect for the band following the release of ''Significant Other'' in 1999, accusing the band of selling out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B-CmQjIHi4|title=Corey Taylor fala sobre o Limp Bizkit (legendado - PTBR)|website=[[YouTube]]|date=December 5, 2013 |access-date=June 6, 2023|archive-date=May 31, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531034256/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B-CmQjIHi4&feature=youtu.be|url-status=live}}</ref> Durst would make further retaliatory comments towards [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]]'s fans in December 1999, referring to them as "fat, ugly kids".<ref>{{cite web |title=6 Times Musicians Continued Working Together After a Long Feud |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/articles/features/6_times_musicians_continued_working_together_after_a_long_feud-118673 |access-date=July 27, 2022 |website=Ultimate-guitar.com |language=en |archive-date=January 23, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240123013423/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/articles/features/6_times_musicians_continued_working_together_after_a_long_feud-118673 |url-status=live }}</ref> Slipknot singer Corey Taylor responded during a February 2000 fan interview in [[Sydney, Australia]] by claiming that the fans of Slipknot "for the most part, enjoy all kinds of music, like Limp Bizkit… maybe." Taylor went on to claim that insulting fans of Slipknot could also be insulting fans of Limp Bizkit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1431271/slipknot-has-issues-to-discuss-with-limps-durst/ |title=Slipknot Feud |date=December 9, 1999 |website=MTV |access-date=February 11, 2016 |archive-date=April 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430123746/http://www.mtv.com/news/1431271/slipknot-has-issues-to-discuss-with-limps-durst/ }}</ref> During an interview with VH1 in October 2000, Durst praised Slipknot's music, expressing his desire to quell the tension between both sides, when asked about Slipknot's music Durst told reporters: "Man this band is super phat, man; we don't even know them. That's their whole thing, that's their chant, that's their thing, that's cool. Maybe all this hate that's going around the world, that's why I said 'It's all the world has even seen lately'". Despite this, Taylor retorted with praise for Durst's financial ventures but attacked his artistic motives, claiming "Fred Durst is a great businessman, but he is not an artist".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKsvn3YLK1w|title=Slipknot Praises and Disses Fred Durst|website=[[YouTube]]|date=April 29, 2008 |access-date=June 6, 2023|archive-date=January 26, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240126153206/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKsvn3YLK1w|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite the attacks between the two bands, they shared numerous UK festival dates together through 2000, including the 2000 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/music/reading-and-leeds-fest-2000-line-up-977498-20230822|title=People can't get over Reading And Leeds Fest 2000 line-up compared to this year|date=August 22, 2023|access-date=September 1, 2023|archive-date=September 1, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901224344/https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/music/reading-and-leeds-fest-2000-line-up-977498-20230822|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/concerts/reading-festival--33|title=August 25, 2000 Reading and Leeds Festival|access-date=September 1, 2023|archive-date=September 1, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901224344/https://www.concertarchives.org/concerts/reading-festival--33|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/festival/2000/live-105-bfd-2000-43d6a7cb.html|title=Live 105 BFD 2000 Setlists|website=setlist.fm|access-date=September 1, 2023|archive-date=September 1, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901224344/https://www.setlist.fm/festival/2000/live-105-bfd-2000-43d6a7cb.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Taylor later claimed that feud began to subside during the late 2000s after the two bands shared a friendly encounter during the [[Download Festival#2009|2009 Download Festival]] in which Durst approached him, informing Taylor that his children were fans of Slipknot's music. Durst asked Taylor if he would sign several autographs for his son, to which Taylor kindly obliged.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/slipknot-limp-bizkit-video-corey-taylor-fred-durst-2000|title=The Slipknot and Limp Bizkit bust up was one of the greatest feuds of the Early 00s|date=May 30, 2022|access-date=June 6, 2023|archive-date=September 1, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230901005658/https://www.loudersound.com/features/slipknot-limp-bizkit-video-corey-taylor-fred-durst-2000|url-status=live}}</ref> The two would continue to find themselves on friendlier terms in 2010.

In August 2021, Limp Bizkit gave a public tribute to Slipknot drummer [[Joey Jordison]] who had recently died on July 26. Durst and the band paid tribute to him during their concert in Des Moines, Iowa (Slipknot's hometown). Durst asked the audience: "Slipknot's from somewhere around here, aren't they?" before expressing support for Jordison and the rest of the band, later telling the crowd "Rest in peace, let's hear it! That's beautiful. Life is short and it's always fleeting so, man, let's just remember all we are is right now" while riling the crowd to chant Jordison's name.<ref>{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Sam |date=August 4, 2021 |title=Watch Limp Bizkit and their fans pay tribute to Slipknot's Joey Jordison |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-limp-bizkit-and-their-fans-pay-tribute-to-slipknots-joey-jordison-3010728 |access-date=July 27, 2022 |website=NME |language=en-GB |archive-date=January 23, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240123131816/https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-limp-bizkit-and-their-fans-pay-tribute-to-slipknots-joey-jordison-3010728 |url-status=live }}</ref> On May 19, 2024, Slipknot turntablist [[Sid Wilson]] made a live appearance during Limp Bizkit's performance at that year's Sonic Temple festival in Columbus, Ohio.<ref>[https://youtube.com/RUGcj-BSKnE?si=Pf8OCmRf4mwPLdrQ] {{Dead link|date=June 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/C7LDWact59H/?hl=en|title=Columbus you guys were Amazing.

===Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor===
[[Marilyn Manson]] was known to be overly vocal against Limp Bizkit's music; in 1999, he attacked the band's artistry and their fans, referring to them as "illiterate apes that beat your ass in high school for being a 'fag' and now sell you tuneless testosterone anthems of [[misogyny]] and pretend to be outsiders...".<ref name="NME"/> Manson, along with [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]], once again took aim at Durst and the band in Nine Inch Nails' video for the song "[[Starfuckers, Inc.]]", in which the two take aim at multiple artists, ranging from [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]' frontman [[Billy Corgan]], [[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M.]], and (most blatantly) Durst and Limp Bizkit. In a 2000 interview, Manson later explained: "With this video, we didn't wanna seem bitching like about somehow that Limp Bizkit's doing better than we are, in their mind." Reznor later added to the comment, stating; "I don't have to say Limp Bizkit sucks, you know it, I know it, I shouldn't have to say it".<ref>[https://youtube.com/8FGrVbtOHYg] {{Dead link|date=June 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Durst responded to Manson and Reznor's insults: "I understand that Marilyn Manson is very unhappy that his career has gone in a shambles and he's alienated his fans, so if he has to say things like that because he's very mad at himself, I would forgive him. And Trent Reznor's in the fucking same boat. Trent Reznor is obviously unhappy with how he's alienated the world, how long he took to make a record, and how he thought he was immortal. We're just here doing what we do and we have nothing to say about anybody. I wish them both luck and I feel sorry that they're so jealous and mad at themselves that they have to talk shit."<ref name="NME" /> Durst's relationship with Manson had seemingly grown cordial as the two later appeared on the cover of a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine issue in June 2003 alongside [[James Hetfield]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Durst-Osborne-Hetfield-Marilyn-Manson/dp/B003S1LRHS|title=Durst, Osborne, Hetfield, Marilyn Manson|access-date=June 19, 2023|archive-date=July 10, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230710165703/https://www.amazon.com/Durst-Osborne-Hetfield-Marilyn-Manson/dp/B003S1LRHS|url-status=live}}</ref> Limp Bizkit guitarist [[Wes Borland]] later joined Manson's touring band in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/wes-borland-denounces-marilyn-manson-as-a-bad-guy-who-needs-to-face-his-demons-2872467|title=Wes Borland denounces Marilyn Manson|website=[[NME]]|date=February 4, 2021|access-date=June 19, 2023|archive-date=June 16, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230616064425/https://www.nme.com/news/music/wes-borland-denounces-marilyn-manson-as-a-bad-guy-who-needs-to-face-his-demons-2872467|url-status=live}}</ref> Borland later departed Manson's touring band after less than nine months, citing an inability to songwrite and criticizing Manson's overbearing leadership.

Even so, you can guarantee one of their primary influences were Limp Bizkit... the happily mismatched band from Jacksonville, Florida, established the ground rules of nü metal.. blur(ring) the lines between the two most polarizing genres in music...

''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine talked about the impact of the band's song "Break Stuff": "If [[Deftones]] represented something deeper about nu-metal, Limp Bizkit represented something entirely at the other end of the scale. Despite having a genuinely innovative guitarist in Wes Borland, whose vision for his genre-straddling band was probably more in line with bands like [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Faith No More]] and [[Mr. Bungle]]... Break Stuff, ahem, broke Limp Bizkit through its fiendishly simple two-chord motif, kick-up-the-arse drop, and its glued-to-MTV video featuring [[Jonathan Davis]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], as well as rap megastars [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]], taking them to an audience far beyond metal.

Limp Bizkit appears in ''[[Generation Kill]]'' (2004), originally conceived by journalist Evan Wright as a three-part ''Rolling Stone'' magazine series, before being released as a full-length book and becoming a 2008 HBO mini-series under the same name. ''Generation Kill'' chronicles Wright's experience as a reporter traveling with a platoon of U.S. [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Recon Marines]] during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. While driving along a winding canal en route to [[Baghdad]], a Ripped, Fuel-ed Corporal from Missouri named Josh Ray Person (played by actor [[James Ransone]]) memorably "recounts the band he formed after high school, Me or Society. A heavy-metal rap group, his band once opened for Limp Bizkit at a show in Kansas City. 'We sucked, but so did they,' Person says. 'The only difference is, they became famous right after we played together. I became a Marine.<ref>Generation Kill, p.&nbsp;71.</ref>
