'''The Verve''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Wigan]] in 1990 by lead vocalist [[Richard Ashcroft]], guitarist [[Nick McCabe]], bass guitarist [[Simon Jones (musician)|Simon Jones]] and drummer [[Peter Salisbury]]. Guitarist and keyboard player [[Simon Tong]] later became a member in their first reunion only.

Beginning with a [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]], [[shoegaze]] sound with their debut LP, ''[[A Storm in Heaven]]'', by 1997 the band had released three [[Extended play|EPs]] and three albums. They endured name and line-up changes, break-ups, health problems, drug abuse and various lawsuits. The band's commercial breakthrough was the 1997 album ''[[Urban Hymns]]'', one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling albums]] in UK history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/assets/files/top%2040%20albums.pdf|title=Top 40 Best Selling Albums: 28 July 1956 – 14 June 2009|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=26 July 2011|archive-date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191500/http://www.bpi.co.uk/assets/files/top%2040%20albums.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> It features the hit singles "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]", "[[The Drugs Don't Work]]", "[[Sonnet (The Verve song)|Sonnet]]" and "[[Lucky Man (The Verve song)|Lucky Man]]".

==History==
===Formation and ''Verve'' (1990–1992)===
The founding members of the Verve met at [[Winstanley College|Winstanley Sixth Form College]], in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan]], Greater Manchester, when Liam Begley introduced [[Richard Ashcroft]] to the other band members. The band was initially known as just '''Verve''', and their first gig was at a friend's birthday party at the Honeysuckle Inn, in [[Wigan]], on 15 August 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/35.shtml |title=This is Music – A Verve History |website=Musicsaves.org |access-date=13 September 2010}}</ref> Most of the band's early material was created through extensive [[jam session]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/37.shtml |title=Bittersweet Triumph |website=Musicsaves.org |access-date=13 September 2010}}</ref> Fronted by Ashcroft, the band caused a buzz in early 1991 for their ability to captivate audiences with their musical textures and [[avant-garde]] sensibilities.

The group were signed by [[Hut Records]] in 1991<ref name="Strong">Strong, Martin C., (2002), ''The Great Rock Discography'', 6th edn, Canongate, {{ISBN|1-84195-312-1}}</ref> and their first studio releases in 1992, "[[All in the Mind (The Verve song)|All in the Mind]]", "[[She's a Superstar]]", and "[[Gravity Grave]]" (along with the December 1992 EP ''[[Verve (The Verve album)|Verve]]'') saw the band become a critical success, making an impression with freeform guitar work by McCabe and unpredictable vocals by Ashcroft. Those first three singles reached the first spot in the UK Indie charts, and "She's a Superstar" entered the UK Top 75 Singles Chart. The band saw some support from these early days in the United States in some music scenes in big cities like New York connected with psychedelic music.

===''A Storm in Heaven'' (1993–1994)===
1993's ''[[A Storm in Heaven]]'' was the band's full-length debut, produced by record producer [[John Leckie]]. "[[Blue (The Verve song)|Blue]]" was released as the lead single and again managed to enter in the UK Top 75 at No.&nbsp;69 and reached No.&nbsp;2 in the Indie charts. The album was a critical success, but was only a moderate commercial success, reaching No.&nbsp;27 in the UK album chart that summer.<ref name="Strong"/> The second single from the album, "[[Slide Away (The Verve song)|Slide Away]]", topped the UK [[indie rock]] charts. During this period the band played a number of gigs with [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] who, at the time, were relatively unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/24.shtml |title=The Verve |website=Musicsaves.org |date=15 May 1995 |access-date=13 September 2010}}</ref> Furthermore, the band supported [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] on the European Part of their [[Siamese Dream]] Tour in autumn of 1993.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fuckyeahtheverve.tumblr.com/post/34889204677/print-media-from-when-the-verve-toured-with-the |title=Smashing Pumpkins Verve Wolverhampton Civic Hall |newspaper=Tumblr |date=11 September 1993 |access-date=14 October 2017 |last1=Vidani |first1=Peter }}</ref>

In 1994, the band released the album ''[[No Come Down]]'', a compilation of B-sides plus a live version of "Gravity Grave" performed at [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 1993. It was the band's first release under the name "The Verve", following legal difficulties with jazz label [[Verve Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/7.shtml |title=Interview |website=Musicsaves.org |access-date=13 September 2010}}</ref> The band then played on the travelling US alternative rock festival [[Lollapalooza]] in the summer of 1994. A new mix of "Blue" was released in the US to promote the band. The tour became notorious for the events of 11 July – Ashcroft was hospitalised for [[dehydration]] after a massive session of drinking<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astorminheaven.com/press/recordcollector-nov97.html |title=Verve A Storm in Heaven – an unofficial site |publisher=A Storm in Heaven |access-date=13 September 2010 |archive-date=16 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216074153/http://www.astorminheaven.com/press/recordcollector-nov97.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{better source|date=February 2025}} and Salisbury was arrested for destroying a hotel room in [[Kansas]] in a drug-fuelled [[Substance-induced delirium|delirium]].<ref name="RS">[[David Fricke|Fricke, David]], "The Verve".

===''A Northern Soul'' and first breakup (1995–1996)===
The Verve's physical and mental turmoil continued into the chaotic recording sessions of their second album, 1995's ''[[A Northern Soul]]'', produced by [[Owen Morris]]. The band departed from the experimental psychedelic sounds of ''A Storm in Heaven'' and focused more on conventional alternative rock, with Ashcroft's vocals taking a more prominent role in the songs, although reminiscent of some of the early work. Around this period, Oasis guitarist and friend of Ashcroft [[Noel Gallagher]] dedicated the song "[[Cast No Shadow (song)|Cast No Shadow]]" on the album ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' to Ashcroft, who returned the gesture by dedicating the song "A Northern Soul" to Gallagher.

The band released the album's first single "[[This Is Music]]" in May, and it reached No.&nbsp;35, their first single to reach the Top 40. It was followed by "[[On Your Own (The Verve song)|On Your Own]]" in June which performed even better, reaching No.&nbsp;28. This single was particularly new for the Verve as it was a soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single "[[History (The Verve song)|History]]", which reached No.&nbsp;24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: "I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because it could have been the greatest time of our lives, with "History" doing well, but I still think I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.' The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/33.shtml |title=Dark Star |website=Musicsaves.org |access-date=13 September 2010}}</ref>

Ashcroft reunited with Jones and Salisbury just a few weeks after the break-up, but McCabe did not rejoin them. The new band hired former [[Suede (band)|Suede]] guitarist [[Bernard Butler]], but he spent only a couple of days with the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-verve-67-1388165|title=The Verve – Is This The End?|website=www.nme.com|date=15 June 1998}}</ref> The band then chose [[Simon Tong]], a school friend credited with originally teaching Ashcroft and Jones to play guitar. The band made no live appearances in 1996, apart from a solo performance from Ashcroft supporting Oasis in New York;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-verve.info/gigs/Mar.13.1996.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828224854/http://www.the-verve.info/gigs/Mar.13.1996.htm|url-status=usurped|title=The Verve Resources and Information|archive-date=28 August 2008|website=The-verve.info}}</ref> the year was spent playing and recording songs for a new album.

===''Urban Hymns,'' success and second breakup (1997–1999)===
In early 1997, Ashcroft asked McCabe to return, saying: "I got to the point where nothing other than The Verve would do for me."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/36.shtml |title=Follow the Yellow Brick Road |website=Musicsaves.org |access-date=13 September 2010 |archive-date=22 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222155655/http://www.musicsaves.org/verve/interviews/36.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref> McCabe obliged and with the new line-up in place (Tong remained on guitar alongside McCabe), the group went through a "spiritual" recording process to finish their third album, ''[[Urban Hymns]].''

For the first time, the Verve achieved commercial success with their new material. The first single, "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]", entered the UK charts at number 2 in June 1997.

The band then played gigs in mainland Europe, but, on 7 June, a post-show fight at the [[Mitsubishi Electric Halle|Philips Halle]] in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Germany]] left McCabe with a broken hand and Ashcroft with a sore jaw. After this, McCabe decided he could not tolerate the pressures of life on the road any longer and pulled out of the tour, leaving the band's future in jeopardy, with rumours of a split circulating in the press. The band continued with session musician [[B. J. Cole]] replacing McCabe, whose guitar work was also sampled and triggered on stage.

The former members sometimes expressed bitter sentiments about the band's later years.

Music – Artists – Ashcroft, Richard: Ashcroft on new CD, Verve reunion |website=Jam.canoe.ca |date=8 February 2006 |access-date=13 September 2010}}</ref> However, after Ashcroft learned that Salisbury was in contact with McCabe over a possible side project, Ashcroft contacted McCabe and Jones, making peace with them, and the band re-formed. Tong was not asked to rejoin, so as to keep the internal issues that split the band up a decade ago to an absolute minimum. Jones explained this decision by stating: "It would have been too hard, it's hard enough for the four of us. If you bring more people to it, it's harder to communicate and communication has always been our difficulty". Paradoxically, McCabe would state years later on his Twitter account, that he intended to include the electric violinist and arranger [[Davide Rossi]] as a new member of the group.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/jones%20it%20would%20have%20been%20too%20hard%20to%20work%20with%20tong_1080157 |title=The Verve – Jones: 'It Would Have Been Too Hard To Work With Tong' |magazine=Contactmusic.com |date=12 September 2008 |access-date=8 December 2011}}</ref> On 26 June 2007, the band's reunion was announced by [[Jo Whiley]] on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The band, reuniting in their original line-up, announced they would tour in November 2007, and release an album in 2008. The band stated: "We are getting back together for the joy of music",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-verve/29261 |title=The Verve reunite for tour |website=NME |date=26 June 2007 |access-date=8 December 2011}}</ref> though they turned down a multi-album deal offer "because the 'treadmill' of releasing albums and touring marked the beginning of the end for the band a decade ago".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/verve%20turn%20down%20multi-album%20deal%20comeback%20offer_1080175 |title=The Verve – Verve Turn Down Multi-Album Deal Comeback Offer – Contactmusic News |magazine=Contactmusic.com |access-date=13 September 2010}}</ref>

Tickets for their six-gig tour in early November 2007 sold out in less than 20 minutes. The tour began in [[Glasgow]] on 2 November, and included 6 performances at the [[Carling Academy Glasgow]], [[The Empress Ballroom]] and the [[Roundhouse (venue)|London Roundhouse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/Article.asp?id=429499 |title=The Verve Reform |website=Xfm.co.uk |access-date=8 December 2011}}</ref> Since the 6-gig tour went extremely well in sales, the band booked a second, bigger tour for December. They played at [[The O2 arena (London)|O2 arena]], the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|SECC]] in Glasgow, the [[Odyssey (Belfast)|Odyssey]] in Belfast, the [[Nottingham Arena]] and [[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|Manchester Central]]. Each show from the first and second part of the tour were sold out immediately. The band continued touring in 2008. They played at most of the biggest summer festivals and a few headline shows all over North America, Europe, Japan and the UK between April and August. Including shows at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], also at the [[Madison Square Garden]] Theater, and the [[Pinkpop]] festival, [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[T in the Park]], the [[V Festival]], [[Oxegen]] Festival, [[Rock Werchter]], [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]] and The [[Eden Project]] Sessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-verve/31505 |title=The Verve announce new tour dates |website=NME |date=2 October 2007 |access-date=8 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/portishead/33794 |title=Coachella 2008 line-up unveiled |website=NME |date=22 January 2008 |access-date=8 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3fm.nl/page/3fm_actueel/251220 |title=Radio 3FM – 3FM – Serious Radio |website=3fm.nl |access-date=8 December 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.oxegen.ie/site/node/34 ''Oxegen Festival 2008 official website''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228125525/http://www.oxegen.ie/site/node/34 |date=28 February 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edenproject.com/about/3353.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907043114/http://www.edenproject.com/about/3353.html|url-status=dead|title=''Eden Project Press Release''|archive-date=7 September 2011}}</ref>

New single "[[Love Is Noise]]" was premiered by [[Zane Lowe]] on [[BBC Radio 1]] on 23 June.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/radio1_aod.shtml?radio1/zane_verve2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902233547/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/noiplayermatch.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 September 2008 |title='Zane plays the new Verve single, avail until 30 Jun 08 |publisher=BBC |access-date=8 December 2011 }}</ref> They performed at the coveted Sunday night slot on the Pyramid Stage at [[Glastonbury]] on 29 June, closing the show with the new song. The Verve released a free download of a non-album track, "Mover", on 30 June. The song had been performed by the band in 1994, but had never seen a proper recording until the reunion. The track was available for download from their official website for one week only.

The band announced the new album's title: ''[[Forth (album)|Forth]]'', which was released in the UK on 25 August and the following day in North America. The album reached No.&nbsp;1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] on 31 August. The lead single "Love Is Noise" was released in the UK on 3 August digitally and one week later (11 August) on its physical form, peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK.<ref>Cohen, Jonathan. [https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044612/the-verve-storms-back-on-fourth-album "The Verve Storms Back on Fourth Album"]. ''Billboard''. 1 August 2008.</ref> The song was a moderate success in Europe, charting at No.&nbsp;16 in the European chart (with 6 weeks in the Top 20). "[[Rather Be (The Verve song)|Rather Be]]", the second single from the album, was released in November but did not become as successful as "Love Is Noise" was, peaking at number 56 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

===Third breakup (2009–present)===
In August 2009, ''[[The Guardian]]'' speculated that The Verve had broken up for a third time,<ref name="Break up">Chad. [http://www.alternativeaddiction.com/musicnews/article/1479/The-Verve-Break-Up...Again "The Verve Break Up...Again"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821163734/http://www.alternativeaddiction.com/musicnews/article/1479/The-Verve-Break-Up...Again |date=21 August 2009 }}. ''Alternative Addiction''. 15 August 2009.</ref> with Jones and McCabe no longer on speaking terms with Ashcroft as they felt he was using the reunion as a vehicle to get his solo career back on track.<ref name="Break up"/> Being asked about the supposed split, Ashcroft told ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "I can confirm we did what we set out to do [...] Right now there are no plans to be doing anything in the near future."<ref name="OnHoliday"/>

Among the reasons for the breakup, it is known that in August 2008, McCabe was ordered to quit drinking by the band's management team, however, the damage had been done to the band's ambient and it was at a point of no return.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Michaels |first=Sean |date=2009-08-12 |title=The Verve split up – for the third time |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/12/verve-split-up |access-date=2024-09-26 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

McCabe, Jones, Rossi (who served as a touring musician of the Verve) and the drummer Mig Schillace started a new band, The Black Ships, who later changed their name to [[Black Submarine]].<ref name="Break up" /> In September 2017, McCabe said he had not spoken to Ashcroft for over a year and that a possible reunion would be unlikely in the foreseeable future.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/verves-nick-mccabe-discusses-urban-hymns-richard-ashcroft-oasis-2135236|title=The Verve's Nick McCabe discusses the state of guitar music, 'Urban Hymns', Richard Ashcroft and Oasis – NME|date=7 September 2017|work=NME|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/ashcroft-rules-out-verve-return_1151675 |title=Richard Ashcroft – Ashcroft Rules Out Verve Return |magazine=Contactmusic.com |date=7 July 2010 |access-date=8 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/6768250.html |title=Richard Ashcroft – Ashcroft will "never say never" to Verve reunion |website=Hot Press |access-date=8 December 2011}}</ref> That year also saw the release of the 20th-anniversary version of ''Urban Hymns''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-verve-to-release-deluxe-20th-anniversary-urban-hymns-lp-2099359|title=The Verve to release deluxe 20th anniversary version of 'Urban Hymns' – NME|date=6 July 2017|work=NME|access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref>

In April 2019, the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] agreed to return the royalties and songwriting credits for "Bitter Sweet Symphony" to Ashcroft.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |last=Gwee |first=Karen |date=2019-06-25 |title=Richard Ashcroft's manager reveals how the Rolling Stones returned the rights to the Verve's 'Bitter Sweet Symphony' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/richard-ashcrofts-manager-reveals-rolling-stones-returned-rights-verve-bitter-sweet-symphony-2513675 |access-date=2022-07-14 |website=[[NME]] |language=en-GB}}</ref> Ashcroft announced the agreement in May, when he received the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]].<ref name=":22">{{Cite web |last=Beaumont-Thomas |first=Ben |date=2019-05-23 |title=Bittersweet no more: Rolling Stones pass Verve royalties to Richard Ashcroft |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/23/bitter-sweet-symphony-royalties-richard-ashcroft-verve-royalties-novello |access-date=2022-07-14 |website=[[The Guardian]] |language=en}}</ref> He said it was a "kind and magnanimous" move, and said: "I never had a personal beef with the Stones.

==Musical style==
Jason Ankeny of [[AllMusic]] described the Verve's sound as "[[wikt:oceanic|oceanic]]", saying that it fused the "exploratory vision of '[[60s counterculture|60s]]-era [[psychedelia]] with the shimmering atmospherics of the [[shoegaze]] aesthetic". The band have been classified as [[neo-psychedelia]], [[Britpop]] and [[alternative rock]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ankeny |first1=Jason |title=The Verve Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More &#124; |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-verve-mn0000575522#biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=November 17, 2024}}</ref>
