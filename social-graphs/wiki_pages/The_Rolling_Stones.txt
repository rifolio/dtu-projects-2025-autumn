'''The Rolling Stones''' are<!--This article is written in British English, which treats a plural group name as plural. Do not change to "is"!--> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1962. Active for over six decades, they are one of the most popular, influential, and enduring bands of the [[Album era|rock era]]. In the early 1960s, the band pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define [[hard rock]]. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist [[Mick Jagger]], guitarist [[Keith Richards]], multi-instrumentalist [[Brian Jones]], bassist [[Bill Wyman]], and drummer [[Charlie Watts]]. During their early years, Jones was the primary leader. [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became their manager in 1963 and encouraged them to write their own songs. The [[Jagger–Richards|Jagger–Richards partnership]] soon became the band's primary songwriting and creative force.

Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the Rolling Stones started out playing [[cover version]]s and were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. They then found greater success with their own compositions: "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]", "[[Get Off of My Cloud]]" (both 1965) and "[[Paint It Black]]" (1966) became international number-one hits. ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966), their first album to be entirely of original material, is often considered to be the most important of their early albums. In 1967, they had the [[A-side and B-side|double-sided]] hit "[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]"/"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]" and experimented with [[psychedelic rock]] on ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]''. By the end of the 1960s, they had returned to their [[rhythm and blues]]-based rock sound, with hit singles "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]" (1968) and "[[Honky Tonk Women]]" (1969), and albums ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), featuring "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]" and "[[Street Fighting Man]]", and ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), featuring "[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]" and "[[Gimme Shelter]]".

Jones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, and was replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. That year saw the first time they were introduced on stage as "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|the greatest rock and roll band in the world]]". ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), which yielded "[[Brown Sugar (Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]" and "[[Wild Horses (Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]" and included the first usage of their [[tongue and lips logo]], was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. It was followed by ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972), featuring "[[Tumbling Dice]]" and "[[Happy (Rolling Stones song)|Happy]]", and ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'' (1973), featuring "[[Angie (song)|Angie]]". Taylor left the band at the end of 1974 and was replaced by [[Ronnie Wood]]. The band released ''[[Some Girls]]'' in 1978, featuring "[[Miss You (Rolling Stones song)|Miss You]]" and "[[Beast of Burden (song)|Beast of Burden]]", and ''[[Tattoo You]]'' in 1981, featuring "[[Start Me Up]]". ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989) was widely considered a [[Comeback (publicity)|comeback album]] and was followed by ''[[Voodoo Lounge]]'' (1994). Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction. By 2007, they had broken the record for the all-time [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tour]] three times, and they were the highest-earning live act of 2021. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, the band continued as a four-piece core, with [[Darryl Jones]] becoming their regular bassist, and then as a three-piece core following Watts' death in 2021, with [[Steve Jordan (drummer)|Steve Jordan]] becoming their regular drummer. ''[[Hackney Diamonds]]'', the band's first new album of original material in 18 years, was released in October 2023, becoming their [[List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones|fourteenth UK number-one album]].

The Rolling Stones have estimated album sales of more than 250&nbsp;million. They have won four [[Grammy Award]]s and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' have ranked them as one of the greatest artists of all time.

In March 1962, the Blues Boys read about the [[Ealing Jazz Club]] in the newspaper ''Jazz News'', which mentioned [[Alexis Korner]]'s [[rhythm and blues]] band, [[Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated]]. The Blues Boys sent a tape of their best recordings to Korner, who was impressed.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=11}} On 7 April, they visited the Ealing Jazz Club, where they met the members of Blues Incorporated, who included [[slide guitar]]ist [[Brian Jones]], keyboardist [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], and drummer [[Charlie Watts]].{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=11}} After a meeting with Korner, Jagger and Richards started jamming with the group.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=11}}

[[File:Crawdaddy club richmond 2014.jpg|thumb|left|The backroom of the former [[Crawdaddy Club]] in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], London, where the Rolling Stones had their first residency, beginning in February 1963]]
Oldham initially tried applying the strategy used by [[Brian Epstein]], the manager of the Beatles, and have the Rolling Stones wear suits. He later changed his mind and imagined a band that contrasted with the Beatles, featuring unmatched clothing, long hair, and an unclean appearance. He wanted to make the Stones "a raunchy, gamy, unpredictable bunch of undesirables" and to "establish that the Stones were threatening, uncouth and animalistic".{{sfn|Szatmary|2014|p=123}} One of Oldham's first acts as manager was to remove Stewart from the official line-up, though he would be retained as the band's road manager and would continue to provide keyboards in the studio and live (initially off-stage, he would eventually play with the band on stage by the mid-1970s).{{sfn|Oldham|2000|p=222}} Oldham later said of this decision, "Well, he just doesn't look the part, and six is too many for [fans] to remember the faces in the picture."<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenfield|first=Robert|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/keith-richards-the-rolling-stone-interview-19710819|title=Keith Richard: The Rolling Stone Interview|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=14 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418035746/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/keith-richards-the-rolling-stone-interview-19710819|archive-date=18 April 2017|url-status=live|url-access=limited|date=19 August 1971}}</ref> Oldham also reduced the band members' ages in publicity material to make them appear as teenagers.{{sfn|Davis|2001|p=79}}

[[Decca Records]], which had declined to sign a deal with the Beatles, gave the Rolling Stones a recording contract with favourable terms.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=22}} The band were to receive a royalty rate three times as high as that typically given to a new act, full artistic control of recordings, and ownership of the [[Audio mastering|recording master tapes]].{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=205, 212}}{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=68}} The deal also let the band use non-Decca recording studios. Regent Sound Studios, a mono facility equipped with egg boxes on the ceiling for sound treatment, became their preferred location.{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=209–210, 212}}{{sfn|Coral|Hinckley|Rodman|1995}} Oldham, who had no recording experience but made himself the band's producer, said Regent had a sound that "leaked, instrument-to-instrument, the right way" creating a "wall of noise" that worked well for the band.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=68}}{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=252–253}} Because of Regent's low booking rates, the band could record for extended periods rather than the usual three-hour blocks common at other studios. All tracks on the first Rolling Stones album, ''[[The Rolling Stones (album)|The Rolling Stones]]'', were recorded there.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=26}}{{sfn|Oldham|2000|p=213}}

Oldham contrasted the Rolling Stones' independence with the Beatles' obligation to record in [[EMI]]'s studios, saying it made the Beatles appear as "mere mortals&nbsp;... sweating in the studio for the man".{{sfn|Oldham|2000|p=205}} He promoted the Rolling Stones as the nasty counterpoint to the Beatles, by having the band pose unsmiling on the cover of their first album. He also encouraged the press to use provocative headlines such as: "Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?"{{sfn|Marshall|2012|p=22}}{{sfn|Wyman|1990|p=136}} In contrast, Wyman says: "Our reputation and image as the Bad Boys came later, completely there, accidentally.&nbsp;... [Oldham] never did engineer it. He simply exploited it exhaustively."{{sfn|Wyman|1990|p=133}} In a 1971 interview, Wyman stated, "We were the first pop group to break away from the whole [[Cliff Richard]] thing where the bands did little dance steps, wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter."<ref>{{cite news|title=Living with Superstardom: The Stones Bill Wyman says 'It Keeps Getting Harder'|date=6 November 1971|newspaper=Billboard |page=29}}</ref>

A cover version of [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[Come On (Chuck Berry song)|Come On]]" was the Rolling Stones' first [[Single (music)|single]], released on 7 June 1963. The band refused to play it at live gigs,{{sfn|Wyman|1990|p=139}} and Decca bought only one ad to promote the record.

Oldham saw little future for an act that gave up the chance to get significant songwriting royalties by only playing the songs of what he described as "middle-aged blacks", thus limiting their appeal to teenage audiences. Jagger and Richards decided to write songs together. Oldham described the first batch as "soppy and imitative".{{sfn|Oldham|2000|pp=256–257}} Because the band's songwriting developed slowly, songs on their first album, ''The Rolling Stones'' (1964; issued in the US as ''England's Newest Hit Makers''), were primarily covers, with only one [[Jagger/Richards]] original—"[[Tell Me (You're Coming Back)]]"—and two numbers credited to [[Nanker Phelge]], the pen name used for songs written by the entire group.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=84}}

Their first international number&nbsp;1 hit was "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]", recorded in May 1965 during the band's third North American tour. Richards recorded the [[guitar riff]] that drives the song with a [[fuzzbox]] as a [[Studio recording#The process|scratch track]] to guide a horn section. Nevertheless, the final cut did not include the planned horn [[overdub]]s. Issued in the summer of 1965, it was their fourth UK number&nbsp;1 and their first in the US, where it spent four weeks at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

During [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|their North American tour in June and July 1966]], the Stones' high-energy concerts proved highly successful with young people, while alienating local police who had the physically exhausting task of controlling the often rebellious crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety "among the authorities and [[the establishment]] seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people". In an effort to capitalise on this, London released the live album ''[[Got Live If You Want It! (album)|Got Live If You Want It!]]'' in December.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2016|pp=177, 178}} The band's first greatest hits album, ''[[Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass)]]'', was released in the UK in November 1966, a different version of which had been released in the US in March that year.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|last=Larkin|first=Colin|author-link=Colin Larkin|page=2005|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-85712-595-8|edition=5th}}</ref>

During this trip the stormy relations between Jones and Pallenberg deteriorated to the point that she left Morocco with Richards.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=264–265}} Richards said later: "That was the final nail in the coffin with me and Brian. He'd never forgive me for that and I don't blame him, but hell, shit happens."{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=113}} Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band's first performances in Poland, Greece, and Italy.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=268}} June 1967 saw the release of the US-only compilation album ''[[Flowers (Rolling Stones album)|Flowers]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Christgau|first1=Robert|author-link1=Robert Christgau|last2=Fricke|first2=David|author-link2=David Fricke|date=19 September 2017|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-essential-albums-of-1967-198515/the-rolling-stones-flowers-198807/|title=50 Essential Albums of 1967|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=9 April 2023|url-access=limited}}</ref>

On 10 May 1967, the day Jagger, Richards and Fraser were arraigned in connection with the Redlands charges, Jones' house was raided by police. He was arrested and charged with possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref name=stonemag /> Three of the five Stones now faced drug charges. Jagger and Richards were tried at the end of June. Jagger received a three-month prison sentence for the possession of four [[amphetamine]] tablets; Richards was found guilty of allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to a year in prison.<ref name=raid>{{cite web|title=Police raid Keith Richard's "Redlands" home in Sussex for drugs |url=http://thehistoryofrockmusic.com/1967/02/12/police-raid-keith-richards-redlands-home-in-sussex-for-drugs/|website=The History of Rock Music|date=<!-- Unknown -->|access-date=25 June 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150626101346/http://thehistoryofrockmusic.com/1967/02/12/police-raid-keith-richards-redlands-home-in-sussex-for-drugs/|archive-date=26 June 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=276}} Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point but were released on bail the next day, pending appeal.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=278–282}}

''[[The Times]]'' ran an editorial, "[[Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?]]", in which conservative editor [[William Rees-Mogg]] surprised his readers by his unusually critical discourse on the sentencing, pointing out that Jagger had been treated far more harshly for a minor first offence than "any purely anonymous young man".{{sfn|Booth|2000|pp=271–278}} While awaiting the appeal hearings, the band recorded a new single, "[[We Love You]]", as a thank you for their fans' loyalty. It began with the sound of prison doors closing, and the accompanying music video included allusions to the trial of [[Oscar Wilde]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/we-love-you-mt0003271872|title=We Love You – song review|last=Janovitz|first=Bill|author-link=Bill Janovitz |publisher=AllMusic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120024305/http://www.allmusic.com/song/we-love-you-mt0003271872|archive-date=20 November 2012|url-status=live|access-date=14 July 2013|date=<!-- Unknown -->}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrBolXPYq40C&q=rolling+stones+we+love+you+music+video+Oscar+Wilde&pg=RA1-PA3|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|last1=Tannenbaum|first1=Rob|last2=Marks|first2=Craig|date=27 October 2011 |publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101526415}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiUxDwAAQBAJ&q=rolling+stones+we+love+you+music+video+Oscar+Wilde&pg=PT212|title='She's So Fine: Reflections on Whiteness, Femininity, Adolescence and Class in 1960s Music'|last=Stras|first=Laurie |author-link=Laurie Stras |date=5 July 2017|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351548731}}</ref> On 31 July, the appeals court overturned Richards' conviction, and reduced Jagger's sentence to a [[conditional discharge]].{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=286}} Jones' trial took place in November 1967.

In December 1967, the band released ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]'', which reached number&nbsp;3 in the UK and number&nbsp;2 in the US. It drew unfavourable reviews and was widely regarded as a poor imitation of the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{sfn|Davis|2001|pp=224–227}}{{sfn|Norman|2001|p=293}} ''Satanic Majesties'' was recorded while Jagger, Richards, and Jones were awaiting their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was publicly amicable,{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=290}} but in 2003 Jagger said: "The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating and that we were being childish. It was not a great moment really—and I would have thought it wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job."<ref name=stonemag /> ''Satanic Majesties'' became the first album the Rolling Stones produced on their own. Its [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] sound was complemented by the cover art, which featured a 3D photo by [[Michael Cooper (photographer)|Michael Cooper]], who had also photographed the cover of ''Sgt. Pepper''. Bill Wyman wrote and sang a track on the album: "[[In Another Land]]", also released as a single, the first on which Jagger did not sing lead.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=296–298}}

The band spent the first few months of 1968 working on material for their next album. Those sessions resulted in the song "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]", released as a single in May. The subsequent album, ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'', an eclectic mix of country and blues–inspired tunes, marked the band's return to their rhythm and blues roots. It was also the beginning of their collaboration with producer [[Jimmy Miller]]. It featured the lead single "[[Street Fighting Man]]" (which addressed the political upheavals of May 1968) and "[[Sympathy for the Devil]]".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=DeCurtis |first=Anthony |author-link=Anthony DeCurtis |date=17 June 1997 |title=Review: Beggars Banquet |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/recordings/review.asp?aid=49080&cf=422 |access-date=9 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020131191122/http://www.rollingstone.com/recordings/review.asp?aid=49080&cf=422 |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 January 2002|url-access=limited}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/beggars-banquet-the-rolling-stones-19691231 |title=''Beggars Banquet'' |date=January 2003 |access-date=22 November 2014 |magazine=Rolling Stone |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523211030/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/beggars-banquet-the-rolling-stones-19691231 |archive-date=23 May 2012|url-access=limited}}</ref> Controversy over the design of the album cover, which featured a public toilet with graffiti covering the wall behind it, delayed the album's release for six months.<ref>{{cite book |last=Denisoff |first=R.

[[File:Mick Taylor2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mick Taylor]], who replaced Brian Jones in the band]]
By the time ''Beggars Banquet'' was released, Brian Jones was only sporadically contributing to the band. Jagger said that Jones was "not psychologically suited to this way of life".{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=128}} His drug use had become a hindrance, and he was unable to obtain a US [[visa (document)|visa]]. Richards reported that in a June meeting with Jagger, Watts, and himself at Jones' house, Jones admitted that he was unable to "go on the road again", and left the band saying, "I've left, and if I want to I can come back."{{sfn|Greenfield|1981}} On 3 July 1969, less than a month later, Jones drowned under mysterious circumstances in the swimming pool at his home, [[Cotchford Farm]], in [[Hartfield]], [[East Sussex]].{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=329}} The band auditioned several guitarists, including [[Paul Kossoff]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Leonard|first=Michael|date=18 March 2013|url=http://legacy.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Free-Spirit-The-Genius-Of-Paul-Kossoff.aspx|title=Free Spirit: The Genius Of Paul Kossoff|work=Gibson.com|access-date=3 July 2022|archive-date=19 July 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230719171343/http://legacy.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Free-Spirit-The-Genius-Of-Paul-Kossoff.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> as a replacement for Jones, before settling on [[Mick Taylor]], who was recommended to Jagger by [[John Mayall]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Carlton |first=William |date=5 September 1979 |title=Mick Taylor seeking new success |page=53 |work=Austin American-Statesman |agency=N.Y.

The Rolling Stones were scheduled to play at a free concert for [[Blackhill Enterprises]] in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], two days after Jones' death; they decided to go ahead with the show as a tribute to him.

Just after the US tour ended, the band performed at the [[Altamont Free Concert]] at the [[Altamont Speedway]], about {{convert|50|mi|km|spell=in}} east of [[San Francisco]]. A [[Hells Angels]] biker gang provided security, and a fan, [[Killing of Meredith Hunter|Meredith Hunter]], was stabbed and beaten to death by the Angels after they realised he was armed.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Burks |first=John |title=Rock & Roll's Worst Day: The Aftermath of Altamont |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=7 February 1970 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/5934386 |access-date=18 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101083841/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5934386/rock__rolls_worst_day |archive-date=1 November 2007}}</ref> Part of the tour, and the Altamont concert, was documented in [[Albert and David Maysles]]' film ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]''.

At the end of the decade, the band appeared on [[BBC]]'s review of the 1960s music scene, ''[[Pop Go the Sixties]]'', performing "Gimme Shelter", which was broadcast live on 31 December 1969. The following year, the band wanted out of contracts with both Klein and Decca, but still owed them one more Jagger/Richards–credited single. To get back at the label and fulfil their final contractual obligation, the band came up with the track "Cocksucker Blues"—deliberately making it as crude as they could in hopes of making it un-releasable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Farber |first=Jim |date=2016-07-19 |title=The Rolling Stones on film, in the flesh: 70s rock decadence gets a rare screening |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/19/rolling-stones-cocksucker-blues-screening-documentary |access-date=2022-07-16 |website=The Guardian}}</ref> Decca instead released "[[Street Fighting Man]]" from ''Beggar's Banquet'' as a UK single in July 1971, the track's 1968 single release having been only in the US.

Amid contractual disputes with Klein, they formed their own record company, [[Rolling Stones Records]].

Following the release of ''Sticky Fingers'', the Rolling Stones left England after receiving advice from their financial manager [[Prince Rupert Loewenstein]]. He recommended they go into tax exile before the start of the next financial year. The band had learned that they had not paid taxes for seven years, despite being assured that their taxes were taken care of; and the UK government was owed a relative fortune.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Nicolson|first=Barry|date=23 April 2015|url=https://www.nme.com/features/rolling-stones-the-grisly-death-and-drugs-filled-story-of-sticky-fingers-757406|title=Rolling Stones: The Grisly Death-And-Drugs Filled Story Of 'Sticky Fingers'|work=NME |access-date=15 August 2017 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816023104/http://www.nme.com/features/rolling-stones-the-grisly-death-and-drugs-filled-story-of-sticky-fingers-757406|archive-date=16 August 2017}}</ref> The Stones moved to the South of France, where Richards rented the [[Villa Nellcôte]] and sublet rooms to band members and their entourage.

Using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, they held recording sessions in the basement. They completed the new tracks, along with material dating as far back as 1969, at [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Studios]] in Los Angeles. The resulting double album, ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'', was released in May 1972, and reached number one in both the UK and the US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/exile-on-main-st/ |title=Exile on Main Street |website=The Rolling Stones|access-date=20 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022151946/http://www.rollingstones.com/release/exile-on-main-st/ |archive-date=22 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Given an A+ grade by critic [[Robert Christgau]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=rolling+stones |title=Reviews – The Rolling Stones|work=Robert Christgau|access-date=30 August 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818104921/http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=rolling%20stones|archive-date=18 August 2017}}</ref> and disparaged by Lester Bangs—who reversed his opinion within months—''Exile'' is now accepted as one of the Stones' best albums.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/exile-on-main-st-mw0000191639 |title=Exile on Main St – album review |work=AllMusic|access-date=14 July 2013|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130716155609/http://www.allmusic.com/album/exile-on-main-st-mw0000191639 |archive-date=16 July 2013}}</ref> The films ''[[Cocksucker Blues]]'' (never officially released) and ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones]]'' (released in 1974) document the subsequent highly publicised [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 North American Tour]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Hodgetts|first=Vicki|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ladies-and-gentlemen-the-rolling-stones-19740509|title=Ladies and Gentlemen: The Rolling Stones|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=10 May 1974|access-date=22 November 2014|url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224225805/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ladies-and-gentlemen-the-rolling-stones-19740509|archive-date=24 December 2014|url-access=limited}}</ref>

In November 1972, the band began recording sessions in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], for the album ''[[Goats Head Soup]]''; it was released in 1973 and reached number&nbsp;1 in both the UK and US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/goats-head-soup/ |title=Goats Head Soup |website=The Rolling Stones |access-date=20 June 2018 |archive-date=8 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408205338/http://www.rollingstones.com/release/goats-head-soup/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The album, which contained the worldwide hit "[[Angie (song)|Angie]]", was the first in a string of commercially successful, but critically tepidly received, studio albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/goats-head-soup-mw0000650701|title=Goats Head Soup – album review |last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas |work=Allmusic |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130707063113/http://www.allmusic.com/album/goats-head-soup-mw0000650701 |archive-date=7 July 2013 |url-status=live|access-date=14 July 2013}}</ref> The sessions for ''Goats Head Soup'' also produced unused material, most notably an early version of the popular ballad "[[Waiting on a Friend]]", which was not released until the ''[[Tattoo You]]'' LP nine years later.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2016|pp=514, 528}}

Another legal battle over drugs, dating back to their stay in France, interrupted the making of ''Goats Head Soup''. Authorities had issued a warrant for Richards' arrest, and the other band members had to return briefly to France for questioning.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|p=408}} This, along with Jagger's 1967 and 1970 convictions on drug charges, complicated the band's plans for their [[The Rolling Stones Pacific Tour 1973|Pacific tour]] in early 1973: they were denied permission to play in Japan and almost banned from Australia. A [[The Rolling Stones European Tour 1973|European tour]] followed in September and October 1973, which bypassed France, coming, as it did, after Richards' recent arrest in England on drug charges.{{sfn|Wyman|2002|pp=361, 412}}

The Stones needed a new guitarist, and the recording sessions in Munich for the next album, ''[[Black and Blue]]'' (1976) (number&nbsp;2 in the UK, number&nbsp;1 in the US), provided an opportunity for some guitarists hoping to join the band to work while trying out. Guitarists as stylistically disparate as [[Peter Frampton]] and [[Jeff Beck]] were auditioned, as well as [[Robert A. Johnson (musician)|Robert A. Johnson]] and [[Shuggie Otis]]. Both Beck and Irish blues rock guitarist [[Rory Gallagher]] later claimed they had played without realising they were being auditioned. American session players [[Wayne Perkins]] and [[Harvey Mandel]] also tried out, but Richards and Jagger preferred for the band to remain purely British. When [[Ronnie Wood]] auditioned, everyone agreed he was the right choice.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=174}} He had already recorded and played live with Richards, and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track "It's Only Rock 'n Roll". He had declined Jagger's earlier offer to join the Stones, because of his commitment to [[Faces (band)|Faces]], saying "that's what's really important to me".{{sfn|Paytress|2003|p=239}} Faces' lead singer [[Rod Stewart]] went so far as to say he would take bets that Wood would not join the Stones.{{sfn|Paytress|2003|p=239}}

In 1975, Wood joined the band as second guitarist for their upcoming Tour of the Americas, which was a contributing factor in the disbandment of Faces. His installment as a Rolling Stone was announced in 1976; unlike the other band members, however, Wood was a salaried employee, which remained the case until the early 1990s, when he finally joined the Stones' business partnership.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/23/ronnie-wood-interview-simon-hattenstone|title=Ronnie Wood: Second Life|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129080634/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/23/ronnie-wood-interview-simon-hattenstone|archive-date=29 November 2014|date=22 April 2011|last1=Hattenstone|first1=Simon}}</ref>

Richards' addiction to heroin delayed his arrival in Toronto; the other members had already arrived. On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family flew in from London, they were temporarily detained by [[Canada Border Services Agency|Canadian customs]] after Richards was found in possession of a burnt spoon and hash residue. Three days later, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], armed with an arrest warrant for Anita Pallenberg, discovered {{convert|22|g|oz}} of heroin in Richards' room.{{sfn|Greenspan|1980|p=518}} He was charged with importing narcotics into Canada, an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence.{{sfn|Sandford|2003|p=225}} The Crown prosecutor later conceded that Richards had procured the drugs after his arrival.{{sfn|Greenspan|1980|pp=517–527}}
[[File:ElMacomboSpadinaAveToronto.jpg|thumb|[[El Mocambo]] in [[Toronto]], where some of the live album ''[[Love You Live]]'' was recorded in 1977|alt=A picture of El Mocambo taken at night.]]

Despite the incident, the band played two shows in [[Toronto]], but caused more controversy when [[Margaret Trudeau]], then-wife of Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], was seen partying with the band after one show. The band's shows were not advertised to the public. Instead, the El Mocambo had been booked for the entire week by [[April Wine]] for a recording session. [[1050 CHUM]], a local radio station, ran a contest for free tickets to see April Wine. Contest winners who selected tickets for Friday or Saturday night were surprised to find the Rolling Stones playing.{{sfn|Sandford|2003|p=227}}

On 4 March, Richards' partner Anita Pallenberg pleaded guilty to drug possession and incurred a fine in connection with the original airport incident.{{sfn|Sandford|2003|p=227}} The drug case against Richards dragged on for over a year. Ultimately, he received a [[suspended sentence]] and was ordered to play two charity concerts to benefit the [[CNIB Foundation|Canadian institute for the blind]] in [[Oshawa]];{{sfn|Greenspan|1980|pp=517–527}} both shows featured the Rolling Stones and [[The New Barbarians (band)|the New Barbarians]], a group that Wood had put together to promote his latest solo album, which Richards also joined. This episode strengthened Richards' resolve to stop using heroin.<ref name=stonemag /> It also ended his relationship with Pallenberg, which had become strained since the death of their third child, Tara. Pallenberg was unable to curb her heroin addiction as Richards struggled to get clean.{{sfn|Sandford|2003|pp=232–233; 248–250}} While Richards was settling his legal and personal problems, Jagger continued his jet-set lifestyle. He was a regular at New York's [[Studio 54]] disco club, often in the company of model [[Jerry Hall]]. His marriage to [[Bianca Jagger]] ended in 1977, although they had long been estranged.<ref>{{Cite news|author=<!-- Unknown -->|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400291/Seventies-and-Eighties.html |title=Seventies and Eighties |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=1 August 2003 |access-date=2 August 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101016071230/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400291/Seventies-and-Eighties.html |archive-date=16 October 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Although the Rolling Stones remained popular through the early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations.<ref name="rockhall3"/> By the mid-1970s, after [[punk rock]] became influential, many people had begun to view the Rolling Stones as an outdated band.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Philo|first=Simon|date=2 September 2015|title=Not Sucking in the Seventies: The Rolling Stones and the Myth of Decline|journal=Rock Music Studies|volume=2|issue=3|pages=295–314|doi=10.1080/19401159.2015.1093377|issn=1940-1159|hdl=10545/620899|s2cid=191963491}}</ref>

The group's fortunes changed in 1978, after the band released ''[[Some Girls]]'', which included the hit single "[[Miss You (The Rolling Stones song)|Miss You]]", the country ballad "[[Far Away Eyes]]", "[[Beast of Burden (song)|Beast of Burden]]", and "[[Shattered (song)|Shattered]]". In part as a response to punk, many songs, particularly "[[Respectable (The Rolling Stones song)|Respectable]]", were fast, basic, guitar-driven rock and roll,<ref name=AMGsomegirls>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/some-girls-mw0000191642|title=Some Girls – album review|work=AllMusic|access-date=14 July 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628230956/http://www.allmusic.com/album/some-girls-mw0000191642|archive-date=28 June 2013}}</ref> and the album's success re-established the Rolling Stones' immense popularity among young people.

Much to his disappointment, Jagger declined.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=92}} ''Emotional Rescue'' hit the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/emotional-rescue/ |title=Emotional Rescue |website=The Rolling Stones |access-date=18 June 2018 |archive-date=8 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408085109/http://www.rollingstones.com/release/emotional-rescue/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> and the title track reached number&nbsp;3 in the US.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=92}}

In early 1981, the group reconvened and decided to tour the US that year, leaving little time to write and record a new album, as well as to rehearse for the tour. That year's resulting album, ''[[Tattoo You]]'', featured a number of outtakes from other recording sessions, including lead single "[[Start Me Up]]", which reached number&nbsp;2<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/the-rolling-stones/chart-history/hsi/ |title=Start Me Up |newspaper=Billboard |access-date=18 June 2018}}</ref> in the US and ranked number&nbsp;22 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100 year-end chart. Two songs ("Waiting on a Friend" (US number&nbsp;13) and "Tops") featured Mick Taylor's unused rhythm guitar tracks, while jazz saxophonist [[Sonny Rollins]] played on "[[Slave (The Rolling Stones song)|Slave]]", "Neighbours", and "Waiting on a Friend".<ref>{{cite web|last=Janovitz|first=Bill|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t2766888|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Rolling Stones: 'Waiting on a Friend'|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=12 November 2014}}</ref> The album reached number&nbsp;2 in the UK and number&nbsp;1 in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/tattoo-you/ |title=Tattoo You |publisher=The Rolling Stones |access-date=18 June 2018 |archive-date=8 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408112220/http://www.rollingstones.com/release/tattoo-you/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Rolling Stones reached number&nbsp;20 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 1982 with "[[Hang Fire]]".

In mid-1982, to commemorate their 20th anniversary, the Rolling Stones took their American stage show to Europe. The European tour was their first in six years and used a similar format to the American tour. The band was joined by former [[Allman Brothers Band]] keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]], who continues to perform and record with them.<ref name="Music Legends">{{cite web|publisher=Music Legends|url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/chuck-leavell-interview-rolling-stones/|title=Interview with Chuck Leavell of the Rolling Stones|access-date=6 May 2013|date=8 April 2010|last=Saulnier|first=Jason|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216075205/http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/chuck-leavell-interview-rolling-stones/|archive-date=16 December 2013}}</ref> By the end of the year, the Stones had signed a new four-album recording deal with a new label, [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], for a reported $50&nbsp;million, then the biggest record deal in history.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=96}}

=== 1983–1988: Band turmoil and solo projects ===
[[File:Richards, Wood onstage in Turin, 1982.jpg|thumb|left|Richards and Wood during a Stones concert in [[Turin]], Italy, in 1982]]
Before leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones released ''[[Undercover (The Rolling Stones album)|Undercover]]'' in late 1983.

Subsequently, the Stones' new marketer/distributor [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] took over distributing their Atlantic catalogue.{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=96}} By this time, the Jagger/Richards rift had grown significantly. To Richards' annoyance, Jagger signed a solo deal with CBS Records and spent much of 1984 writing songs for his first album. He also declared his growing lack of interest in the Rolling Stones.{{sfn|Richards|Fox|2010|pp=470–472}} By 1985, Jagger was spending more time on solo recordings. Much of the material on 1986's ''[[Dirty Work (The Rolling Stones album)|Dirty Work]]'' was generated by Richards, with more contributions from Wood than on previous Rolling Stones albums. It was recorded in Paris, and Jagger was often absent from the studio, leaving Richards to keep the recording sessions moving forward.{{sfn|Richards|Fox|2010|p=461}}

In June 1985, Jagger teamed up with [[David Bowie]] for "[[Dancing in the Street#Bowie/Jagger version|Dancing in the Street]]", which was recorded for the [[Live Aid]] charity movement.<ref>{{cite news|last=Seideman|first=Tony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2iQEAAAAMBAJ&q=dancing+in+the+street+-+JAGGER+BOWIE+live+aid&pg=PA1|title=Bowie/Jagger Vidclip Heads for Movie Screens|newspaper=Billboard|page=1|date=24 August 1985|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818104921/https://books.google.com/books?id=2iQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=dancing%20in%20the%20street%20-%20JAGGER%20BOWIE%20live%20aid&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vnNdT8mwCIPZ8AOu6dmEDw&ved=0CGUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=dancing%20in%20the%20street%20-%20JAGGER%20BOWIE%20live%20aid&f=false|archive-date=18 August 2017}}</ref> This was one of Jagger's first solo performances, and the song reached number&nbsp;1 in the UK, and number&nbsp;7 in the US.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17011078|title=Sir Mick Jagger returns to UK singles chart|work=BBC |access-date=12 March 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223104718/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17011078|archive-date=23 February 2012|date=13 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> In December 1985, Ian Stewart died of a heart attack.<ref name="tributeToIan">{{cite magazine |last=DeCurtis |first=Anthony |date=10 April 1986 |title=Stones Pay Tribute to Ian Stewart With Club Show, Special Guests |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/stones-pay-tribute-to-ian-stewart-with-club-show-special-guests-246141/ |url-access=limited |access-date=2022-07-03 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> The Rolling Stones played a private tribute concert for him at London's [[100 Club]] in February 1986.<ref name="tributeToIan" /> Two days later they were presented with a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=1986-02-26 |title='We Are the World' is big Grammy hit |page=5 |work=Santa Maria Times |agency=Knight-Ridder Newspapers |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/104854578/we-are-the-world-is-big-grammy-hit/ |access-date=2022-07-03 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

In early 1989, the Stones – Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman, Ronnie Wood, Brian Jones, Mick Taylor, and Ian Stewart – were inducted into the American [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], with Jagger, Richards, Wood and Taylor in attendance.<ref name="rockhall3"/>  Jagger and Richards set aside their animosity and went to work on a new Rolling Stones album, ''[[Steel Wheels]]''. Heralded as a return to form, it included the singles "[[Mixed Emotions (The Rolling Stones song)|Mixed Emotions]]" (US number&nbsp;5), "[[Rock and a Hard Place (Rolling Stones song)|Rock and a Hard Place]]" (US number&nbsp;23) and "[[Almost Hear You Sigh]]". The album also included "Continental Drift", which the Rolling Stones recorded in Tangier, Morocco, in 1989, with [[the Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar]], coordinated by Tony King and Cherie Nutting. [[Nigel Finch]] produced the BBC documentary film ''The Rolling Stones in Morocco''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00jsgbs|title=The Rolling Stones- Continental Drift|work=BBC Four|date=12 August 2011|author=<!--Unknown -->|access-date=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904024728/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00jsgbs|archive-date=4 September 2015}}</ref> Finch also directed ''[[25x5: The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones]]'', a documentary spanning the band's 25-year history, featuring new interviews with the five current members and archival interview material of Brian Jones and Mick Taylor.

The [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]] was the band's first world tour in seven years and their biggest stage production to date. Opening acts included [[Living Colour]] and [[Guns N' Roses]].

After the successes of the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle tours, the band took a break. Watts released two jazz albums; Wood recorded his fifth solo album, the first in 11 years, called ''[[Slide On This]]''; Wyman released his fourth solo album; Richards released his second solo album in late 1992, ''[[Main Offender]]'', and did a small tour, including big concerts in Spain and Argentina.{{sfn|Bockris|1992|p=394}}{{sfn|Neill|2015|p=137}} Jagger got good reviews and sales with his third solo album, ''[[Wandering Spirit (album)|Wandering Spirit]]'', which reached number&nbsp;12 in the UK<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14177/mick-jagger/ |title=Mick Jagger |website=Official Charts Company |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> and number&nbsp;11 in the US.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/mick-jagger/chart-history/tsl/ |title=Wandering Spirit |magazine=Billboard |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> The album sold more than two million copies worldwide, being certified Gold in the US.<ref name="RIAA"/>

After Wyman's departure, the Rolling Stones' new distributor/record label, [[Virgin Records]], remastered and repackaged the band's back catalogue from ''Sticky Fingers'' to ''Steel Wheels'', except for the three live albums. They issued another hits compilation in 1993 entitled ''[[Jump Back]]'', which reached number&nbsp;16 in the UK and number&nbsp;30 in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rollingstones.com/release/jump-back-the-best-of-71-93/ |title=Jump Back |website=The Rolling Stones |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> By 1993, the Stones were ready to start recording another studio album.

Jones continues to perform with the band as their touring and session bassist. The album met with positive reviews and strong sales, going double platinum in the US.

The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres into their own collective sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference to and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R&B, country, folk, reggae, dance, and [[world music]]—exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the [[Master Musicians of Jajouka]]—as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instruments such as harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments, such as the sitar and slide guitar, in their early days.<ref>

Despite the Rolling Stones' predilection for blues and R&B numbers on their early live set lists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. Critic [[Richie Unterberger]] described the first Jagger/Richards single, "Tell Me (You're Coming Back)", as a "[[pop rock]] ballad&nbsp;... When [Jagger and Richards] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, [[Beat music|Mersey]]-type pop numbers".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/tell-me-mt0011910726 |title=Tell Me – song review |last=Unterberger |first=Richie|work=AllMusic|access-date=14 July 2013|url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130722004917/http://www.allmusic.com/song/tell-me-mt0011910726 |archive-date=22 July 2013}}</ref> "[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, "It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn't think of [recording] it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group."<ref name="Jagger Remembers">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/mick-jagger-remembers-92946/ |title=Mick Jagger Remembers |last=Wenner |first=Jann |date=14 December 1995 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200819153817/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/mick-jagger-remembers-92946/ |archive-date=19 August 2020 |url-status=live |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=5 November 2020|url-access=limited}}</ref> The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/as-tears-go-by-mt0010501752 |title=As Tears Go By – song review |last=Ruhlmann |first=William|work=Allmusic|access-date=14 July 2013|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130714052625/http://www.allmusic.com/song/as-tears-go-by-mt0010501752 |archive-date=14 July 2013}}</ref>

Richards said of their early writing experiences, "The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], 'Well, at least we gave it a try&nbsp;...{{'"}}{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=85}} Jagger opined, "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order&nbsp;... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us."{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=85}}

The writing of "The Last Time", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it "a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it."{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=95}} The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by [[the Staple Singers]], but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones.<ref name=":02">{{cite book|last=van der Luft|first=Eric|year=2009|title=Die at the Right Time!: A Subjective Cultural History of the American Sixties|page=102}}</ref> Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge.

Beginning with Jones and continuing with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards refers to as the "ancient art of weaving" responsible for part of their sound—the interplay between two guitarists on stage.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|pp=[https://archive.org/details/accordingtorolli00jagg/page/160 160–161]}} Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's.{{sfn|Richards|Fox|2010|p=241}}<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Handy|first=Bruce|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/11/taylor-swift-the-new-mick-jagger|title=Taylor Swift is Officially the New Mick Jagger (and Here's Why)|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=16 November 2012|access-date=6 November 2019}}</ref> Likewise, Watts was primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto1"/> The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards, and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes for a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rolling Stones: Sociological Perspectives |last=Staubmann |first=Helmut|page=35|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0-739-17672-6}}</ref> In the studio the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on ''Beggars Banquet'' are driven by [[Nicky Hopkins]]' piano playing. On ''Exile on Main St.'', Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four.{{sfn|Perone|2012|pp=159, 185}}

Richards started using [[open tuning]]s for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a [[Capo (musical device)|capo]]), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single "Honky Tonk Women", "Brown Sugar" (''Sticky Fingers'', 1971), "[[Tumbling Dice]]" (capo IV), "[[Happy (Rolling Stones song)|Happy]]" (capo IV), (''Exile on Main St.'', 1972), and "Start Me Up" (''Tattoo You'', 1981).<ref>{{cite book|last=Chris|first=Gill|year=1995|title=Guitar legends: the definitive guide to the world's greatest guitar players|page=108|publisher=HarperPerennial}}</ref>

The feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin addict,{{sfn|Richards|Fox|2010|p=236}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/13/rolling-stones-some-girls-interview |title=The Rolling Stones: that 50-year itch…|last=Day|first=Elizabeth|date=12 November 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=17 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170817122425/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/13/rolling-stones-some-girls-interview|archive-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> resulting in Jagger managing the band's affairs for many years.<ref name="Jagger Remembers"/> When Richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision-making, Jagger was not used to it and did not like having his authority diminished.

Stephen Hyden writes:<blockquote>The Rolling Stones turn 50 next year, an unprecedented milestone for a rock group and confirmation of an obvious truism: Nobody survives like the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. Starting out as a purist blues combo that fronted a bad-boy image while recording the occasional Lennon/McCartney pop tune and string-laden ballad to help secure their popularity, the Stones deftly moved through a number of guises in the '60s and '70s while remaining essentially the same band at its core. When [[arena-rock]] reigned, the Stones became an excessive live act whose decadence was on par with [[Led Zeppelin]]; when [[David Bowie]] and [[glam rock|glam]] became the hippest thing in England, Mick Jagger lathered on the mascara and campy posturing. By the time of 1978's ''[[Some Girls]]'', the Stones absorbed the energy of New York City's [[punk rock|punk]] and [[disco]] scenes so completely that it reinvigorated the band's career, spawning their final (to date) No. 1 single in the U.S., "Miss You."<ref>{{cite news| last=Hyden| first=Stephen| title=The Rolling Stones: Some Girls| date=November 29, 2011| url=https://www.avclub.com/the-rolling-stones-some-girls-1798170638}}</ref></blockquote>

On Jagger's 75th birthday in 2018, scientists named seven fossil stoneflies after present and former members of the band. Two species, ''Petroperla mickjaggeri'' and ''Lapisperla keithrichardsi'', were placed within a new family Petroperlidae.

During the 1975 Tour of the Americas, arena shows became an industry for the band, and the Stones hired a new lighting director, Jules Fisher.{{sfn|Davis|2001}}{{Page needed|date=August 2023}} The props the band used on stage increased in both size and sophistication, similar to those on Broadway.<ref name=":14" /> They started to use multiple stages, from which they would select for a particular show. On this tour they had two versions of what Jagger referred to as the "lotus stage". One version had a large Venetian (cylindrical) curtain, and the other had leaves that began in a folded up position and opened during the beginning of the concert.<ref name=":14" /> This period also included a variety of props, including inflatable penises and other gimmicks,<ref name=":14" /> and incorporated a number of circus tricks.<ref name=":14" />

During the 1981–1982 American tour, the Stones worked with Japanese designer Kazuhide Yamazari in constructing their stages for stadium-sized locations and audiences.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|pp=190–192}}<ref name="sloppy_start">{{Cite news|last=Loder|first=Kurt|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-stones-sloppy-start-19811112|title=The Stones' Sloppy Start|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=12 November 1981|access-date=1 June 2018|url-access=limited}}</ref> During this period, stages increased in size to include runways and movable sections of the stage going out into the audience.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|pp=190–192}}<ref name="sloppy_start" /> This tour used coloured panels and was one of the last Stones tours to do so before switching to devices such as video screens.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|pp=190–192}} Stadium shows provided a new challenge for the band.{{sfn|Jagger|Richards|Watts|Wood|2003|p=192}}

Over time, their props and stage equipment have become increasingly sophisticated.
