'''Evanescence''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band <!--do not change "founded" to "formed" as Evanescence was founded as a duo project; a band was not "formed" then-->founded<!--do not change to "formed"--> in 1994 by singer and keyboardist [[Amy Lee]] and guitarist [[Ben Moody]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. After releasing independent [[extended play|EP]]s and a [[Origin (Evanescence demo album)|demo CD]] as a duo in the late 1990s, Evanescence released their debut studio album, ''[[Fallen (Evanescence album)|Fallen]]'', on [[Wind-up Records]] in 2003. Propelled by the success of hit singles like "[[Bring Me to Life]]" and "[[My Immortal (song)|My Immortal]]", ''Fallen'' sold more than four million copies in the US by January 2004, garnering Evanescence two [[Grammy Award]]s out of six nominations. They released their first live album and concert DVD, ''[[Anywhere but Home]]'', in 2004, which sold over one million copies worldwide.

Evanescence released their second studio album, ''[[The Open Door]]'', in 2006, co-composed by Lee and guitarist [[Terry Balsamo]]. It received a Grammy nomination and has sold more than six million copies worldwide. With Balsamo, guitarist [[Troy McLawhorn]], bassist [[Tim McCord]] and drummer [[Will Hunt]], the band reconvened in 2009 to work on music for their next album, ''[[Evanescence (Evanescence album)|Evanescence]]''. Released in 2011, it marked the first album co-written as a band. It debuted at the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and Hard Rock Albums charts. Following the end of the album's tour cycle, the band entered a hiatus.

In 2014, Lee and Evanescence left their record label and became an [[independent artist|independent]] band. The band emerged from hiatus in 2015 and resumed touring, while a new album was not yet created as Lee was also focusing on a solo project. In 2016, Lee stated that Evanescence was working on a fourth album, ''[[Synthesis (Evanescence album)|Synthesis]]'' (2017), composed of [[orchestral]] and [[electronica]] arrangements of their previous material alongside two new songs. Its release was followed by the [[Synthesis Live]] tour, in which the band performed with live orchestras for the first time. After [[COVID-19 pandemic|pandemic]] delays, Evanescence released their fifth studio album, ''[[The Bitter Truth]]'', in 2021, which reached the top five of the ''Billboard'' [[Independent Albums|Independent]], Alternative, and Hard Rock charts.

Generally classified as a [[gothic rock|gothic]] [[alternative metal]] and [[hard rock]] band, Evanescence have a diverse sound incorporating various musical styles including [[classical music]], [[alternative music]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[industrial music]], and [[electronic music]], driven by Lee's contrasting musical pursuits and introspective songwriting. Beginning as a duo partnership, Evanescence had several lineup changes, and became a band collaboration in 2009. The band comprises Lee, guitarist Tim McCord since 2006, guitarist Troy McLawhorn and drummer Will Hunt since 2007, and bassist Emma Anzai since 2022. Among other accolades, Evanescence has received two Grammy Awards, three [[Loudwire Music Awards|''Loudwire'' Music Awards]], a [[Kerrang! Award|''Kerrang!'' Award]], a [[Revolver Golden Gods Music Awards|''Revolver'' Golden Gods Music Award]], a ''[[Rock Sound]]'' award, a [[Brit Award]] nomination, three [[American Music Award]] nominations, and five [[MTV Video Music Award]] nominations. Evanescence have sold a total of 31.9 million albums, making the band one of the best selling hard rock and metal artists of all time.<ref name="loudwire.com">{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/top-25-best-selling-rock-metal-artists/|title=The Top 25 Best Selling Hard Rock + Metal Artists of All Time|website=[[Loudwire]] |date=August 19, 2022|access-date=January 10, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221014070352/https://loudwire.com/top-25-best-selling-rock-metal-artists/|archive-date=October 14, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
===1994–2000: Formation and early years===
Singer and pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody met in 1994 in Little Rock, Arkansas at age 13 and 14, when the two were at a Christian youth camp where Lee played piano during sport activities and Moody played acoustic guitar and she thought they could play music together.{{refn|<ref name="blender705">{{cite news |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=705 |title=Survivor! |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender magazine]] |first=Michael |last=Odell |date=April 2004|page=64 |access-date=October 18, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124062408/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=705 |archive-date=January 24, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview|title=JJ interviews Evanescence|date=October 20, 2006|interviewer=JJ Kincaid|publisher=[[Z100 New York]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0uM54gEZ9U|quote=[Lee:] I'm going to tell the real story.

===2001–2004: ''Fallen'' and ''Anywhere but Home''===
{{Main|Fallen (Evanescence album)|l1=Fallen}}
Evanescence were having their demos mastered at [[Ardent Studios]] in Memphis, where a producer heard it and played the demos to his friend at [[Wind-up Records]], head of A&R [[Diana Meltzer]].<ref name="Paul"/><ref name="hitquarters.com" /><ref name="Harrington"/> Meltzer said what made her want to sign them was Lee's voice, lyrics and their gothic sound. When she heard "[[My Immortal (song)|My Immortal]]" she said she "knew it was a hit".<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Evanescence was signed by Wind-up in 2001.<ref name="lands"/> The label flew them to New York, and told them that they loved their different sound and thought they had potential, but "we don't really totally know what to do with you", Lee recalled. They were then told, "if you were this good while distracted by school and all this other stuff, how good will you be if we put you in an environment where you have nothing to do but write and be influenced by your surroundings, like in Los Angeles."<ref name="Harrington"/><ref name="Paul"/> They were relocated to Los Angeles, given an apartment and rehearsal space and enrolled in a gym, according to Meltzer,<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> and Lee, who was very introverted, received help from an acting teacher to overcome her stage fright.<ref name="fact-or-fiction"/><ref name="Harrington"/><ref name="blender705"/> Meltzer told [[HitQuarters]] in 2003 that, while she loved Lee's voice, their gothic sound, and Lee and Moody had already exhibited "huge talent" with their prior demo material, they were still young and she felt they could benefit from more time to work on their debut album so they "could deliver a breakthrough sound".<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Diana_Meltzer_int.html |title=Interview With Diana Meltzer |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=July 7, 2003 |access-date=October 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908185725/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Diana_Meltzer_int.html |archive-date=September 8, 2011}}</ref>

Lee said that at the time of signing, they did not realize the label would move them out to Los Angeles for two years, thinking it would be about six months. The length of time in Los Angeles "really frustrated" them.<ref name="Harrington"/> The label was apprehensive about the marketability of a female-led band, and advised them to just keep writing songs.<ref name="Paul"/> It ended up being a fruitful writing experience in Los Angeles, Lee said, as they wrote half of the album there and were able to make use of other equipment to get sounds they wanted.<ref name="Harrington"/> After almost two years of Evanescence working on the album, [[Dave Fortman]] was brought in to produce it.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Then, label executives refused to release the album unless Lee and Moody agreed to hire a full-time male co-vocalist. When they did not agree, the label said they were withdrawing their funding and releasing them from their contract. They left Los Angeles and drove back to Little Rock.{{refn|<ref name="OH"/><ref name="fact-or-fiction"/><ref name="Scuzz">{{cite interview|last=Lee|first=Amy|interviewer=Terry Bezer|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbcgsjmNzO4&t=931 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319144353/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbcgsjmNzO4&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=March 19, 2013|title=Scuzz Meets Evanescence |work=[[Scuzz|Scuzz TV]]|date=March 13, 2013 |access-date=December 29, 2013}}</ref>}}

A few weeks later, the label relented, informing them that they would release their album if they agreed to have a male rapper on its lead single, "[[Bring Me to Life]]", in order to give something familiar to listeners. Lee was not happy about this, but reluctantly agreed to the compromise and wrote the part for the male vocal.{{refn|<ref name="Scuzz"/><ref name="fact-or-fiction"/><ref name="OH"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-bring-me-to-life-by-evanescence|title=The story behind Bring Me To Life by Evanescence|work=[[Louder Sound]]|date=February 14, 2018|access-date=November 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221205042437/https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-bring-me-to-life-by-evanescence|archive-date=December 5, 2022|url-status=live}}</ref>}} She originally wanted the lead single to be "[[Going Under (song)|Going Under]]" as she was concerned that the public would hear "Bring Me to Life" with its male vocal and decide that was the sound of the band. She was relieved that people were still receptive to Evanescence when "Going Under" was released as their second single.{{refn|<ref name="OH"/><ref name="Scuzz"/><ref name="fact-or-fiction"/>}} Lee prefers "Bring Me To Life" without the label-forced rap, and expressed dissatisfaction that it "stamps a time period" on the song; however, she made peace with it because they were able to "survive past it" and "people were able to, for the most part, understand who we are without us getting stuck in that place."<ref name="Scuzz"/><ref name="OH"/><ref name="dazed"/>

"Bring Me to Life", featuring guest vocals from Paul McCoy of [[12 Stones]], and "My Immortal" were originally featured on [[Daredevil: The Album|the soundtrack]] of the 2003 action film ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', released in February 2003. Evanescence's debut album ''[[Fallen (Evanescence album)|Fallen]]'' was released by Wind-up on March 4, 2003.<ref name="Fallen RIAA"/> As with their pre-''Fallen'' work, Lee and Moody were the main writers of the album, with Lee being the core writer.{{refn|<ref name="billinterview"/><ref name="west"/><ref name="Chain"/><ref name="Rock 20">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Rock Sound]]|title=The First|first=Maddy|last=Howell|date=December 2020|page=62|issue=272}}</ref>}}  Most of Lee's writing on ''Fallen'' was inspired by an abusive relationship she was in.<ref name="blender705" /><ref name="Maerz"/> Lee and Moody said they did not consider their music to be "goth", with Moody adding that he thinks the "goth" label came because the songs sound sad and people think that "sad equals dark equals Goth.

Lee said that she and Moody had never sat down and wrote together, and instead would combine their respective parts in songs. From the start, Lee would only write music by herself, considering it a vulnerable process and feeling disrespected by Moody and unsafe around him. The creation of ''Fallen'' largely consisted of her and Moody writing music separately and then adding to each other's work, due to tension and significant creative differences between them. Lee's creative disagreements with Moody included his strict approach to songwriting and focus on commerciality; he would "always be corralling" her ideas, and wanting to push them in a more commercial, pop direction.{{refn|<ref name="smh"/><ref name="Wood">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]|date=November 2006|page=48|title=Profiles: The Brutal Truth - Evanescence|first=Mikael|last=Wood|quote= <br> · Amy Lee: "But whether or not you can write with someone in the studio, you can never know until you actually get in there and try it.
