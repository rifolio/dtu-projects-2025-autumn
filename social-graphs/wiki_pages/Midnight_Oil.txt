'''Midnight Oil''' (known informally as "'''The Oils'''") are <!-- Bands that originate from Australia are treated plural, so do not change "are" to "is". See WP:ENGVAR. --> an Australian rock band composed of [[Peter Garrett]] (vocals, harmonica), [[Rob Hirst]] (drums), [[Jim Moginie]] (guitar, keyboard) and [[Martin Rotsey]] (guitar). The group was formed in [[Sydney]] in 1972 by Hirst, Moginie and original bassist Andrew James as '''Farm''': they enlisted Garrett the following year, changed their name in 1976, and hired Rotsey a year later. [[Peter Gifford]] served as bass player from 1980 to 1987, with [[Bones Hillman]] then assuming the role until his death in 2020. Midnight Oil have sold over 20 million albums worldwide as of 2021.

Midnight Oil issued their [[Midnight Oil (Midnight Oil album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1978 and gained a cult following in their homeland despite a lack of [[mainstream media]] acceptance. The band achieved greater popularity throughout [[Australasia]] with the release of ''[[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]]'' (1982) – which spawned the singles "[[Power and the Passion (song)|Power and the Passion]]" and "[[US Forces (song)|US Forces]]" – and also began to attract an audience in the United States. They achieved their first Australian number one album in 1984 with ''[[Red Sails in the Sunset (album)|Red Sails in the Sunset]]'', and topped their native country's singles chart for six weeks with the [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Species Deceases]]'' (1985).

The group garnered worldwide attention with 1987 album ''[[Diesel and Dust]]''. Its singles "[[The Dead Heart]]" and "[[Beds Are Burning]]" illuminated the plight of [[Indigenous Australians]], with the latter charting at number one in multiple countries. Midnight Oil had continued global success with ''[[Blue Sky Mining]]'' (1990) and ''[[Earth and Sun and Moon]]'' (1993) – each buoyed by an international hit single in "[[Blue Sky Mine]]" and "[[Truganini (song)|Truganini]]", respectively – and remained a formidable album chart presence in Australia until their 2002 disbandment. The group held concerts sporadically during the remainder of the 2000s and announced a full-scale reformation in 2016. The band released their 15th and final studio album, ''[[Resist (Midnight Oil album)|Resist]]'', on 18 February 2022,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marbecks >> Resist – Midnight Oil |url=https://www.marbecks.co.nz/detail/594663/Resist |website=marbecks.co.nz |access-date=8 March 2022}}</ref> and announced an accompanying tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/midnight-oil-final-tour-new-album-resist/|title=Midnight Oil Confirm Final Tour and New Album|website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]]|date=27 November 2021|access-date=8 March 2022}}</ref>

The band's music often broaches political subjects, and they have lent their support to multiple causes. They have won eleven [[ARIA Awards]] and were inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] in 2006. [[#Legacy|Midnight Oil's legacy]] has grown since the late 1970s, with the outfit being cited as an influence, and their songs [[Cover version|covered]], by numerous popular artists. Aside from their studio output, the group are celebrated for their energetic live performances, which showcase the frenetic dancing of Garrett. ''[[Guardian Australia|Guardian]]'' writer Andrew Street described Midnight Oil as "one of Australia's most beloved bands".

== History ==
=== Farm: 1972–1976 ===
In 1971 drummer [[Rob Hirst]], bass guitarist Andrew James, and [[keyboard instrument|keyboard player]]/lead guitarist [[Jim Moginie]] were performing together. They adopted the name "Farm" in 1972,<ref name="ARDb" /> and played covers of [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] songs.<ref name="Howl" /> They placed an advert for a band member;<ref name="RS3" /> [[Peter Garrett]] (ex-Rock Island Line) became their new vocalist and synthesizer player and began introducing [[progressive rock]] elements of [[Focus (band)|Focus]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] and [[Yes (band)|Yes]], as well as their own material.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Howl" /> Garrett was studying at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]], so Farm was only a part-time band.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Howl" /> They played for the northern-Sydney surfing community and, by 1975, were touring the east coast.<ref name="McF" /> In late 1976 Garrett moved to Sydney to complete his law degree.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Howl" /> Farm then became a full-time group and changed its name to "Midnight Oil" by drawing a name out of a hat, leaving behind "Television", "Sparta", and "Southern Cross".<ref name="Jeff" />

The name "Midnight Oil" was inspired by the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song "[[Burning of the Midnight Lamp]]",<ref name="Howl" /> although the word "oil" appears nowhere in the lyrics. The expression "midnight oil" first appeared in a 1635 poem by [[Francis Quarles]] (1592-1644):<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=midnight+oil Online Etymological Dictionary]</ref>
{{Poem quote|title=''Emblems'', 1635|
To heaven's high city I direct my journey, 
Whose spangled suburbs entertain mine eye.
We spend our midday sweat, our '''midnight oil''';
We tire the night in thought, the day in toil.}}

=== 1976–1981 ===
[[File:Martin Rotsey.jpg|thumb|upright|Martin Rotsey, Midnight Oil guitarist, at the Souths Leagues Club in Brisbane, 2007]]

After changing its name to Midnight Oil, the group began to develop an aggressive, punk-hard rock sound for their [[Pub rock (Australia)|pub rock]] audiences.<ref name="Howl" /> Guitarist [[Martin Rotsey]] joined in 1977<ref name="ARDb" /> and Midnight Oil, with their manager Gary Morris, established their own record label Powderworks.<ref name="ARDb" /> In June 1978 they entered the [[Albert Productions|Alberts Studio]] in Sydney with producer Keith Walker, from local radio station [[Triple J|2JJ]], to record their debut [[:wikt:eponym|eponymous]] album, ''[[Midnight Oil (Midnight Oil album)|Midnight Oil]]'', which was released by Powderworks in November 1978 and peaked at No.&nbsp;43 on the Australian albums charts.<ref name="Kent" /> Midnight Oil's first single "Run by Night" followed in December,<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Howl" /> but had very little chart success, peaking at No.&nbsp;100 on the singles charts.<ref name="Kent" />

The band built a dedicated fan base, initially restricted to Sydney, which was extended to other Australian cities through constant touring – performing some 200 gigs in their first year.<ref name="Howl" /> They became known for their furious live performances, which featured the two guitarists Moginie and Rotsey, the drumming and vocals of Hirst and the presence of the towering, bald Garrett as lead singer.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Howl" /><ref name="RSBio" />

The ''Midnight Oil'' [[long play|LP]] disappointed some critics as it did not capture their powerful live performances, with undemanding playing and Garrett's vocals sounding stilted.<ref name="McF" /> Their second album ''[[Head Injuries]]'', released on Powderworks in October 1979, was produced by former [[Supercharge (band)|Supercharge]] member Leszek Karski.<ref name="ARDb" /> It mixed solid guitar rock with progressive flourishes and was an improvement by highlighting the group's strengths and growth.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Howl" /> It peaked at No.&nbsp;36 and by mid-1980 had achieved gold status.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Kent" /> In April 1980 founding bass guitarist Andrew James left because of ill-health and was replaced by [[Peter Gifford]] (ex-Huntress, Ross Ryan Band).<ref name="ARDb" />

Further interest in Midnight Oil was generated by the popular ''[[Bird Noises]]'' [[extended play|EP]], also produced by Karski, which peaked at No.&nbsp;28 on the Australian singles charts.<ref name="Kent" /> One of its four tracks was the surf-instrumental "Wedding Cake Island" named after the [[Wedding Cake Island|rock outcrop]] in the ocean off Sydney's [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee Beach]]. The band's third LP ''[[Place without a Postcard]]'', released by [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] in November 1981, was recorded in [[Sussex]] with English producer [[Glyn Johns]] ([[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]]).<ref name="ARDb" /><ref name="Howl" /> Creative tensions between the band and Johns plagued the recording and the group were not totally happy with the outcome. Johns had an arrangement with [[A&M Records]] and they asked Midnight Oil to return to the studio to record material suitable for an American single release – they refused and returned to Australia.<ref name="Howl" /> ''Place without a Postcard'' peaked at No.&nbsp;12 on the albums charts and related singles "Don't Wanna be the One" and "Armistice Day" reached the Top 40 in Australia.<ref name="Kent" />

=== Fans, music industry, media ===
Driven largely by commercial pressures to stay with reliable chart-toppers and teenage pop sensations, the Australian music industry in the mid-1970s cast a dismissive eye toward most bands with an [[alternative rock|alternative]] outlook. Although consistently championed by Sydney alternative rock station [[Triple J|Double Jay]] and its FM band successor Triple J, Midnight Oil were almost totally ignored by Australia's mainstream commercial radio stations in their early career. Manager Morris developed a reputation as one of the toughest managers and became notorious for banning critics or journalists, who were usually given free admission to concerts, for writing unfavourable reviews. Writer and critic [[Bruce Elder (journalist)|Bruce Elder]], in a mid-1980s newspaper review described their music as "narrow and xenophobic" and declared Midnight Oil were:

{{blockquote|"a kind of [[antipodean]] pub rock version of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] [...] life-denying, sexist, secular and bigoted [...] endless touting of Australia and all things Australian"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/Sept06/Rose%20review.htm |title=Rose Review |work=[[Australian Book Review]] |last=Rose |first=Peter |year=2006 |access-date=21 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930052915/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/Sept06/Rose%20review.htm |archive-date=30 September 2008 }}</ref>|Bruce Elder quoted in ''Crème de la Phlegm: Unforgettable Australian Reviews'' (2006), ed.:Angela Bennie. {{ISBN|0-522-85241-6}}}}

In retaliation, Morris banned Elder from Oils shows permanently. Elder later recanted, describing them as the only Australian band to have developed a truly Australian sound.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The frostiness of Midnight Oil's relationship with the traditional music media quickly saw the band develop a strong "street cred" and a reputation for making no compromises with the music industry. In the early 1980s the band was scheduled to appear on an episode of the all-powerful [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) TV pop show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' but on the day of the show they were "bumped" from the line-up. ''Countdown'' required artists to mime their songs during 'live' performances, Midnight Oil and Morris insisted they perform completely live and have their sound engineer supervising – neither side backed down.<ref name="Verrender">{{cite news |url=http://www.deadheart.org.uk/opinion/articles/essay.php?article_id=18 |title=Is anyone listening? |last=Verrender |first=Ian |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=14 September 1996 |access-date=22 October 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031019054525/http://www.deadheart.org.uk/opinion/articles/essay.php?article_id=18 |archive-date=19 October 2003 }}</ref> According to ''Countdown'' producer Michael Shrimpton, the band had arrived late for rehearsal and, due to the show's very tight schedule and budget, there was a strict policy that latecomers were not allowed to appear; and, as such, they were told they could not perform that day. In response, the group declared that they would never appear on the show, a promise they faithfully kept.<ref name="Quirk">{{cite news | title=The quirks that made it work |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=5 August 2006 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/the-quirks-that-made-it-work/2006/08/04/1154198331689.html |access-date=21 October 2008 }}</ref> ''Countdown'' presenter [[Ian Meldrum|Molly Meldrum]] shaved his head bald, imitating Garrett, for its final show on 19 July 1987 and expressed regret that Midnight Oil had never appeared on the show.<ref name="Jeff" /><ref name="Quirk" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countdownmemories.com/exclusive_interviews/molly_interview.html |title=An interview with Molly Meldrum by Jason |date=19 August 2004 |last=Grech |first=Jason |work=Countdown Memories |access-date=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720033612/http://www.countdownmemories.com/exclusive_interviews/molly_interview.html |archive-date=20 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Fans of the group were drawn to the band's "us and them" mindset, and fan loyalty to the Oils' ideas and music was fierce. Two venues at which they built significant fan bases from their early live performances were the Sydney northern beaches [[pub]] The Royal Antler at [[Narrabeen]] and the Bondi Lifesaver club near Sydney's [[Bondi Beach]]. Politically oriented rock of the style produced by the band was something of a new concept for the Australian music scene, and Peter Garrett quickly earned a reputation as one of the most charismatic and outspoken musicians in the country. He recalled that there were dangers in playing the pub scene:

{{blockquote|You get booked into a pub or hotel, say in the western suburbs of Sydney. Halfway through your set, two large, drunk truck drivers decide to have a fight. They're beating each other up and careening towards the corner where the band is set up. Meanwhile, everyone else is going, 'Aaah, turn it down, I'm trying to watch TV.' Try to contemplate that as an environment to play music in every night for three years.<ref name="Cockington">{{Cite book |last=Cockington |first=James |date=August 2001 |title=Long Way to the Top |publisher=ABC Books |location=Sydney, N.S.W. |page=188 |isbn=0-7333-0750-7 }}</ref>|Peter Garrett quoted in ''The Big Australian Rock Book'' (1985) published by ''Rolling Stone'' Magazine, ed.:Ed St John, {{ISBN|0-9590615-0-9}}}}

=== Rise to fame: 1982–1985 ===
==== ''10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'' ====
Their Australian breakthrough and first international recognition came in 1982, with the release of ''[[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]]'', which included the singles "[[Power and the Passion (song)|Power and the Passion]]" and "[[Read about It]]". The album peaked at No.&nbsp;3 and "Power and the Passion" peaked at No.&nbsp;8.<ref name="Kent" /> The album also includes their denunciation of American military interference in foreign affairs in "[[US Forces (song)|US Forces]]" and their critique of imperialist repression in "[[Short Memory]]". ''10 to 1'' was recorded in London during September and produced by Englishman [[Nick Launay]],<ref name="McF" /><ref name="ARDb" /> who had previously worked with acts including [[The Jam]], [[XTC]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[PiL]], [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]].<ref name="McF" /> Launay worked on several other major Australian recordings in this period including [[INXS]]' ''The Swing'', [[Models (band)|Models]]' ''The Pleasure of Your Company'' and [[The Church (band)|The Church]]'s ''Seance''.

The album remained in the Australian charts for 171 weeks.<ref name="Kent" /> It retained their live energy but was more adventurous and radical than previous work.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Howl" /> Their ascendancy was signalled by a series of concerts on the release of the album at Sydney's Capitol Theatre, one of which was filmed and recorded and later released on their 2004 ''[[Best of Both Worlds (Midnight Oil album)|Best of Both Worlds]]'' DVD.

However, the organisers insisted, arguing that the band would reach a wider audience within the predominantly [[white people|Caucasian]] urban centres.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Midnight Oil requested that all [[royalties]] from the song go to [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous communities]].<ref name="MemTV" /> In addition, two indigenous groups, Warumpi Band and Gondwanaland, toured with them.

Following the 1988 American tour in support of ''Diesel and Dust'' with Australian band [[Yothu Yindi]], Midnight Oil launched the ''[https://www.discogs.com/Various-Building-Bridges-Australia-Has-A-Black-History/master/811978 Building Bridges – Australia Has A Black History]'' album with various artists contributing, including [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], [[Scrap Metal (band)|Scrap Metal]], Coloured Stone, [[Hunters & Collectors]], [[James Reyne]], [[The Saints (Australian band)|The Saints]], [[Crowded House]], [[INXS]] and Yothu Yindi.<ref name="McF" /> All sales proceeds were donated to the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations.<ref name="McF" />

In Sydney in 1990, while Midnight Oil were taking a break, Hirst joined up with guitarist Andrew Dickson, drummer Dorland Bray of [[Do-Re-Mi (band)|Do-Ré-Mi]], guitarist Leszek Karski (Midnight Oil producer) and bass guitarist [[Richard Grossman (bassist)|Rick Grossman]] of [[Hoodoo Gurus]] to form a side project called [[Ghostwriters (band)|Ghostwriters]].<ref name="ARDbGhost">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329042458/http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/g/ghostwriters.html |url=http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/g/ghostwriters.html |title=Ghostwriters |last1=Holmgren | first1=Magnus |publisher=Australian Rock Database.

Morris responded with, "My suggestion to these people is to stop shooting themselves in the foot and let a band like Midnight Oil voice its appeal to White Australia on behalf of Black Australia".<ref name="Vellutini" />

Critics contended that Morris disparaged Indigenous Australians' ability to represent themselves and overestimated Midnight Oil's ambassadorial powers while diminishing their errors, while some indigenous activists saw benefit in Midnight Oil's highlighting of the issues.<ref name="Vellutini" /> Nevertheless, "Truganini" released in March peaked at No.&nbsp;10 on the ARIA singles charts,<ref name="AusCharts" /> No.&nbsp;10 on ''Billboard'' Mainstream Rock Tracks and No.&nbsp;4 on their Modern Rock Tracks charts,<ref name="BillS" /> and top thirty for the UK charts.<ref name="UKCharts" /> Peter Garrett issued an apology for the mistake in the liner notes.

==== Sydney 2000 Olympic Games performance ====
Midnight Oil again brought the politics of [[Reconciliation in Australia|Reconciliation]] to the fore during their performance at the [[2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics]]. Then Prime Minister [[John Howard]] had triggered controversy that year with his refusal to embrace symbolic reconciliation and apologise to Indigenous Australians and members of the [[Stolen Generations]].{{citation needed|date=December 2021}} But he had also said their reconciliation-themed single "[[Beds Are Burning]]" was his favourite Midnight Oil song. Midnight Oil performed the song at the ceremony with the word [[National Sorry Day|SORRY]] conspicuously printed on their clothes as a form of apology to Indigenous people for their suffering under white settlement and to highlight the issue to Howard, who was in the audience at the Olympic stadium as an estimated one billion people watched on television.<ref name="Vellutini" /> Midnight Oil had consulted with tour mates Yothu Yindi and other Indigenous activists, so that their performance would bring popular protest to the world arena.<ref name="Vellutini" />

In 2001, when [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) surveyed 100 music industry people for their Top 10 Best Australian songs of all time, "Beds Are Burning" was voted No.&nbsp;3 behind [[The Easybeats]]' "[[Friday on My Mind]]" and [[Daddy Cool (band)|Daddy Cool]]'s "[[Eagle Rock (song)|Eagle Rock]]".<ref name="APRA10">{{cite web|url=http://www.apra.com.au/awards/music/2001_topten.asp |title=The final list: APRA'S Ten best Australian Songs |last=Culnane |first=Paul |publisher=[[Australasian Performing Right Association]] |date=28 May 2001 |access-date=20 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308150930/http://www.apra.com.au/awards/music/2001_topten.asp |archive-date=8 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the 2001 [[APRA Awards (Australia)|APRA Awards]] ceremony "Beds are Burning" was shown on video and introduced by [[Australian Democrats]] [[Aden Ridgeway|Senator Aden Ridgeway]] as an [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] spokesperson on Reconciliation.<ref name="APRA10" /> "Power and the Passion" was also listed in APRA's [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs|Top 30 best Australian songs]].<ref name=apra01 />

=== Dissolution and reunion ===
[[File:Oils Alive Again by rakka of oz.jpg|thumb|Midnight Oil at Manly Leagues Club, 2005]]
Garrett announced his decision to quit Midnight Oil on 2 December 2002, to refocus on his political career.<ref name="Howl" /> In the [[1984 Australian federal election|1984 federal election]], Garrett had stood for the [[Australian Senate]] under the [[Nuclear Disarmament Party]] banner and narrowly lost. He won the seat of [[Division of Kingsford Smith|Kingsford Smith]] at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 General Election]] for the [[Australian Labor Party]] and was selected as Shadow Minister for Climate Change, Environment, Heritage and the Arts. On Thursday, 29 November 2007, Prime Minister elect [[Kevin Rudd]] named Garrett as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. The other members of the band continued to work together, but not under the Midnight Oil name.

After a warm up gig the previous evening at the Manly-Warringah Leagues Club, the band, including Garrett, reunited to perform at the [[WaveAid]] concert on 29 January 2005 to raise funds for the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|26 December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The concert, which took place at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], also included performances by [[Powderfinger]], [[Silverchair]], [[Nick Cave]], [[John Butler Trio]], [[Finn Brothers]], and others.

On 29 October 2006, Midnight Oil was inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] with ARIA chairman [[Denis Handlin]] describing them:

{{blockquote|For 30 years, on their journey from inside Sydney's Royal Antler Hotel to outside the Exxon Building in New York, the Oils have always led from the front. They spoke to us – and to the world – in a uniquely Australian way. [...] Their music speaks first – it's powerful, it's uncompromising, it's unique rock music that inspires, entertains and will last forever. [...] My favourite Oils lyric, which summarises it all is: 'It's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.'<ref name="Jeff" />|[[Denis Handlin]]|2006 }}

[[Rob Hirst]], in his acceptance speech, thanked his family, bandmates, and support from fellow Australians. He also lamented the fact that unlike the Vietnam war, which had inspired some of the best [[protest songs]] ever written, very few had been written in reaction to the invasion of Iraq.<ref name="Jeff" />

''[[Flat Chat]]'', another compilation album, was released in November 2006 and peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the ARIA album charts.<ref name="AusCharts" /> Rumours of an appearance by Midnight Oil at the [[Live Earth concert, Sydney|Sydney leg]] of the [[Live Earth]] concert in July 2007<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/sydney-to-kick-off-earth-concerts/2007/04/11/1175971145480.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |title=Sydney to kick off Earth concerts |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=11 April 2007 |access-date=25 October 2008 }}</ref> were false. However [[Ghostwriters]], founded by drummer Hirst and [[Hoodoo Gurus]] bass guitarist [[Richard Grossman (bassist)|Rick Grossman]] and including former Oils guitarist [[Martin Rotsey]], performed six tracks including the Oils' song "When the Generals Talk", whilst [[Peter Garrett]] gave a speech introducing a reformed [[Crowded House]].

=== Reunion, the Great Circle Tour, ''Midnight Oil: 1984'' and ''Armistice Day'' ===
On 4 May 2016 it was announced on the band's website that Midnight Oil intended to reform and embark on a tour in 2017 (their first concerts in Australia since 2002 and their first world tour since 1997).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.midnightoil.com/a-message-from-midnight-oil/ | title=A message from Midnight Oil | publisher=Midnight Oil | date=4 May 2016 | access-date=30 January 2020 }}</ref> Such plans were confirmed in February 2017, when the band announced ''The Great Circle Tour'', which kicked off in April. After three warm up concerts in their native Australia, the band toured Brazil, the U.S., Canada, Europe, South Africa, Singapore and New Zealand before going back to play a series of concerts around the whole of Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midnightoil.com/tour-dates/#past-dates|title=Tour Dates|publisher=Midnight Oil|access-date=15 January 2018}}</ref> The band performed 77 concerts in 16 countries during the tour.

In March 2018, the band announced the release of a new documentary film entitled ''Midnight Oil: 1984''. Directed by Ray Argall, the film primarily consists of previously-unseen footage from the band's tour in support of ''Red Sails in the Sunset''. The film was given an Australian cinematic release in May 2018, an Australian DVD/Blu-ray release the following July and a limited North American and New Zealand cinematic release that August.

One of the Great Circle tour's final concerts was held on [[Armistice Day]] at The Domain, in [[Sydney]] on 11 November 2017. Both shows at the Domain (the band also performed there on 17 November) were filmed and recorded, being turned into the live album and film ''Armistice Day: Live at the Domain, Sydney''.

=== 2021–present: ''Resist'' and final tour ===
{{main|Resist (Midnight Oil album)}}
On 18 May 2021, Midnight Oil announced on Twitter that their thirteenth album, with the working title ''Show of Hands'', was scheduled for release during their performance at the 2021 [[Byron Bay Bluesfest]]. As the event was cancelled in mid-August and the majority of lineup was confirmed for the 2022 edition (set to 14 April), the band's plans to release the album remained undefined for some six months.

On 28 October 2021, the band released on YouTube a video for their first single from the album, "[[Rising Seas (song)|Rising Seas]]".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bareton |first1=Greta |title=Midnight Oil call out government inaction on climate change with new single 'Rising Seas' |url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/midnight-oil-call-out-government-inaction-on-climate-change-with-new-single-rising-seas-3082037 |website=NME Australia |date=28 October 2021 |publisher=BandLab Technologies |access-date=25 November 2021}}</ref> They announced the single on Twitter: "The uncompromising song, released on the eve of [the United Nations Climate Change Conference] ([[COP26]]), adds the band's unique voice to billions of others around the world seeking a safe, habitable, and fair future for our planet." The band featured no bassist in the video, leaving only a bass guitar in a stand in the background beside the drums as a tribute to Hillman.

On 26 November 2021, the band officially announced the album ''[[Resist (Midnight Oil album)|Resist]]'', which was released 18 February 2022. With the announcement of the album came the release of national Australian tour dates for 2022, which the band confirmed would be their last, while simultaneously confirming that the band will continue to make music together in the future.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neal |first1=Matt |title=Midnight Oil announce final tour to coincide with latest studio album |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-26/midnight-oil-announce-final-tour/100652360 |website=ABC News |date=25 November 2021 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=25 November 2021}}</ref> ''Resist: The Final Tour'' concluded on 3 October 2022 at the [[Hordern Pavilion]] in Sydney with a 40-song, three-and-a-half-hour set from the band.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Billy |first1=August |title=Midnight Oil Perform For Over Three Hours at Final Ever Show |url=https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/midnight-oil-perform-for-over-three-hours-at-final-ever-show-sydney/ |website=Music Feeds |date=4 October 2022 |publisher=Evolve Media |access-date=10 October 2022}}</ref>
