'''Duran Duran''' ({{IPAc-en|dj|ʊ|ˌ|r|æ|n|_|dj|ʊ|ˈ|r|æ|n}}) are<!--Duran Duran are an English band, so this article is written in British English. See [[WP:ENGVAR]].--> an English [[pop rock]] band. Formed in [[Birmingham]] in 1978 by keyboardist [[Nick Rhodes]], guitarist (later bassist) [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]] and singer/bassist [[Stephen Duffy]], the band went through several early changes before the band's line-up settled in May 1980 as Rhodes, Taylor, singer [[Simon Le Bon]], guitarist [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Duran Duran drummer)|Roger Taylor]].{{refn|group=nb|None of the three Taylors are related to each other, nor to [[Queen (band)|Queen]] drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]].}}

The band's breakthrough second album was ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'' (1982), a worldwide hit. The songs "[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]" and "[[Rio (song)|Rio]]" featured cinematic music videos directed by Australian film maker [[Russell Mulcahy]] and became two of their biggest hits. Their third album, ''[[Seven and the Ragged Tiger]]'', became their only UK number one album and featured the US and UK number one single "[[The Reflex]]". In 1985, the band topped the US charts with the single "[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]" from the soundtrack of the [[James Bond]] [[A View to a Kill|film of the same title]].

Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor both left the band before the recording of their fourth album, ''[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]'' (1986), which yielded the top ten [[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|title track]]. Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor initially continued as a core trio, before adding guitarist [[Warren Cuccurullo]] and drummer [[Sterling Campbell]] as full-time members in 1989, though Campbell departed in 1991. The band spent the late 1980s and early 1990s releasing albums and singles to only moderate success. However, their 1993 album ''[[Duran Duran (1993 album)|Duran Duran]]'' (commonly called ''The Wedding Album''), featured two top ten worldwide hits "[[Ordinary World (song)|Ordinary World]]" and "[[Come Undone (Duran Duran song)|Come Undone]]". John Taylor left the band in 1997, though four years later, in 2001, a full reunion of the classic 1980–1985 line-up of Le Bon, Rhodes and all three Taylors took place, which led to a number of highly successful concert tours and the 2004 album ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'', which reached number three in the UK and top 40 in numerous other countries. The album's lead single "[[(Reach Up for The) Sunrise]]" was an international dance hit, and reached number five in the UK. Andy Taylor left again in 2006, and the band have since released five albums, with the most recent being ''[[Danse Macabre (Duran Duran album)|Danse Macabre]]'' in 2023.

According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Duran Duran have sold over 100 million records.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=26 October 2016|title=Duran Duran to Get ASCAP Golden Note Award at London's ASCAP Awards|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/duran-duran-ascap-awards-golden-note-award-london-7556897/|magazine=Billboard|access-date=3 November 2016|archive-date=5 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105015728/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7556897/duran-duran-ascap-awards-golden-note-award-london|url-status=live}}</ref> They achieved 30 top 40 singles in the [[UK singles chart]] (14 of them top 10) and 21 top 40 singles in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Childhood friends [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]] and [[Nick Rhodes]] formed Duran Duran in 1978 in [[Birmingham]], England, together with Taylor's art school friend [[Stephen Duffy]], naming their band after "Dr. Durand Durand", [[Milo O'Shea]]'s character from the science fiction film ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968), the day after the film was broadcast on BBC on 20 October 1978.<ref name="early1" />  The three of them (Taylor on guitar and vocals, Rhodes on synthesizer and tapes, Duffy on vocals and bass) played their first gig on 5 April 1979 at the [[Birmingham Polytechnic]]. Soon after, they were joined by Simon Colley on clarinet and bass. John (then going by his first name Nigel) was the guitarist at this point. After a few gigs, including a performance at [[Barbarella's]] in Birmingham opening for the band [[Fashion (band)|Fashion]], Duffy and Colley left the band in June 1979.<ref name="early1">{{cite web |url=https://durancompilations.com/early1.html |title=Duran Duran – The Early Days Chapter 1 |publisher=durancompilations.com |access-date=26 May 2022 |archive-date=26 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220526050020/https://durancompilations.com/early1.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Taylor and Rhodes then recruited lead vocalist Andy Wickett (formerly frontman of ''TV Eye'') and decided that they needed a live drummer. They hired [[Roger Taylor (Duran Duran drummer)|Roger Taylor]], a former member of various local bands (most recently ''The Scent Organs'' who also played at Barbarella's), while John Taylor switched to bass guitar. In September 1979, this incarnation of the band recorded a four-track demo including an early version of "[[Girls on Film]]" co-written by Andy Wickett. Soon afterwards Alan Curtis was recruited as lead guitarist. After a few gigs with this line-up Wickett left the band in late 1979.{{sfn|Malins|2013|loc=chaps. 1–2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://durancompilations.com/early2.html |title=Duran Duran – The Early Days Chapter 2|publisher=durancompilations.com |access-date=26 May 2022 }}</ref>

Wickett was replaced by Roger Taylor's friend and former singer of ''The Scent Organs'' Jeff Thomas. In early 1980, they became the resident band at the city's [[Rum Runner (nightclub)|Rum Runner]] nightclub. They were doing jobs at the club and began rehearsing and regularly playing at the venue. Curtis was unhappy with the Rum Runner club scene and left the band to form [[Dif Juz]] with his brother. Thomas was fired shortly after following disagreements and repeated arguments. The three remaining members started to look for a new lead vocalist and guitarist.<ref name="Chapter 3">{{cite web |url=https://durancompilations.com/early3.html |title=Duran Duran – The Early Days Chapter 3 |publisher=durancompilations.com |access-date=26 May 2022 |archive-date=26 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220526045907/https://durancompilations.com/early3.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The owners of the club, brothers Paul and Michael Berrow, became the band's management, paying them to work as doormen, disc jockeys (DJs) and barmen when they were not rehearsing, and also formed the Tritec Music company.<ref name="Chapter 4" />

In April 1980, guitarist [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]] came from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to audition after responding to an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. Andy already had a lot of experience from playing with [[cover band]]s for years and although he came from a totally different [[rock music]] background his versatile playing style was seen as a perfect complement to the band.{{sfn|Malins|2013|loc=chap. 2}}<ref name="Chapter 3" /> In May 1980, London vocalist and drama student [[Simon Le Bon]] was recommended to the band by an ex-girlfriend who worked at the Rum Runner.<ref name="Green">{{Cite journal|last = Green|first = Jo-Anne|title = Your Mission, Barbarella: Find Duran Duran|journal=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]|volume = 24|issue = 456 |publisher=F+W Publications Inc.|date = 16 January 1998|url = http://www.lizardkingduran.com/gold.html | access-date =1 May 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304091132/http://www.lizardkingduran.com/gold.html |archive-date = 4 March 2007}}</ref> The band were immediately impressed by Le Bon and soon completed their first composition with the new line-up, "Sound of Thunder", featuring lyrics by Le Bon.{{sfn|Malins|2013|loc=chap. 2}}<ref name="Chapter 4">{{cite web |url=https://durancompilations.com/early4.html |title=Duran Duran – The Early Days Chapter 4 |publisher=durancompilations.com |access-date=26 May 2022 |archive-date=26 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220526045913/https://durancompilations.com/early4.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Duran Duran's first performance with the lineup of Le Bon, Rhodes and the three Taylors was on 16&nbsp;July 1980 at the Rum Runner.<ref name="UCR">{{cite web |last=Zaleski |first=Annie |author-link=Annie Zaleski |title=40 Years Ago: Duran Duran Take First Steps to Fame on Debut LP |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/duran-duran-debut-album/ |website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date=15 June 2021a |access-date=22 April 2022 |archive-date=22 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220422224332/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/duran-duran-debut-album/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Duran Duran spent the next months writing, developing and [[Demo (music)|demoing]] their songs and performed in clubs around Birmingham and London. In September 1980 they had written all of what would become their debut album.{{sfn|Malins|2013|loc=chap. 2}} Touring as an opening act for [[Hazel O'Connor]], the band attracted critical attention, resulting in a bidding war between the record companies [[EMI Records|EMI]] and [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]].{{sfn|Malins|2005|p=60}} "A certain patriotism" toward the label of [[the Beatles]] led them to sign with EMI in December. A week later, the first article about Duran Duran in a national magazine appeared in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''. The members of Duran Duran had noticed that Betty Page (pen name for Beverley Glick) was writing about a new movement called [[New Romantic]] that would fit the band perfectly and invited her to meet them at the Rum Runner.<ref name="Chapter 4" />

Shortly after signing the [[recording contract]] with EMI, Duran Duran went to London to record their debut album with producer [[Colin Thurston]], and initial plans for an independent release of the songs "[[Planet Earth (Duran Duran song)|Planet Earth]]" and "Is There Anyone Out There?" on the Tritec Music label were scrapped.<ref name="Chapter 4" />

===1981–1982: Self-titled debut, ''Rio'' and Second British Invasion===
The band's debut album, ''[[Duran Duran (1981 album)|Duran Duran]]'', was released on the EMI label in June 1981. The first single, "[[Planet Earth (Duran Duran song)|Planet Earth]]", had reached the United Kingdom's top 20 at number 12 in February.{{sfn|Malins|2013|loc=chap. 4}}{{sfn|Davis|2021|pp=109–112}} A follow-up, "[[Careless Memories]]", released in April, stalled at number 37.{{sfn|Davis|2021|pp=104, 111}} The third single, "[[Girls on Film]]", was released in July and went to number 5 in the UK.{{sfn|Malins|2013|loc=chap. 4}} The video, featuring topless women [[mud wrestling]], [[pillow fight]]ing and stylised depictions of other [[sexual fetish]]es, was made with directing duo [[Godley & Creme]] in August.{{sfn|Shuker|2001|p=170}} The video was filmed just two weeks after MTV was launched in the United States.{{sfn|Malins|2005|pp=77–79}} The band expected the "[[Girls on Film]]" video to be played in the newer nightclubs that had video screens or on [[pay TV]] channels like the [[Playboy Channel]]. [[Kevin Godley]] explained the thinking behind it:

{{blockquote|We were very explicitly told by Duran Duran's management to make a very sensational and erotic piece that would be for clubs, where it would get shown uncensored just to make people take notice and talk about it.{{sfn|Shuker|2001|p=170}}}}

The video was heavily edited for MTV. The album peaked in the UK top twenty at number three. Later in 1981 the band embarked on their first United States club tour followed by more dates in Germany and the UK. This second tour of Britain coincided with a wave of riots sparked by unemployment and racial tension, including those of [[1981 Moss Side riot|Moss Side]] and [[1981 Toxteth riots|Toxteth]]. The band played Birmingham the day after the [[1981 Handsworth riots|Handsworth riots]]. The band also began writing and demoing songs for a new album. In November 1981, they released a new single, the [[disco music|disco]]-influenced "[[My Own Way (song)|My Own Way]]", that reached number 14 in the UK, followed in early 1982 by the recording of their second album at [[AIR Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Davis|2021|pp=117–121}}

In May 1982, Duran Duran released their second album, ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'', which entered the UK Albums Chart at number four and peaked at number two the following week.<ref name="oc"/> The band scored three UK top 10 hits on the singles chart from the album with "[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]" at number five in June, "[[Save a Prayer]]" at number two in September and the title song "[[Rio (song)|Rio]]" at number nine in December,<ref name="oc" /> while the earlier top 20 hit "[[My Own Way (song)|My Own Way]]" was included in a re-recorded version on the album.

With the album Duran Duran also began to achieve worldwide recognition. A headlining tour of Australia, Japan and the US was followed by a stint supporting [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] during that band's final American tour. [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] declared Duran Duran her favourite band, and the band were dubbed "the Fab Five" by the British press, comparing them to [[the Beatles]] whose nickname was the Fab Four.{{sfn|Malins|2005|p=118}}<ref>{{Cite news|date=29 March 1984|title=The Charlotte News, 29 March 1984|pages=41|work=The Charlotte News|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67020066/the-charlotte-news-29-march-1984/|access-date=6 January 2021|archive-date=7 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210107124359/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67020066/the-charlotte-news-29-march-1984/|url-status=live}}</ref>

At first, the ''Rio'' album did not do well in the United States. EMI in the UK had promoted Duran Duran as a New Romantic band, but the New Romantic movement was barely known in the US, and EMI's American subsidiary [[Capitol Records]] was at a loss about how to sell them. After ''[[Carnival (Duran Duran EP)|Carnival]]'' (an [[Extended play|EP]] of ''Rio''{{'s}} dance remixes) became popular with DJs in the autumn, the band arranged to have most of the album remixed by [[David Kershenbaum]]. In June 1982, Duran Duran appeared for the first time on American television, performing "Hungry Like the Wolf" and "Rio" on ''[[Dancin' on Air]]'', the forerunner to the national hit show ''[[Dance Party USA]]''.

Now promoted as a dance album, ''Rio'' was re-released in the US in November and began to climb the American charts six months after its European success. MTV placed "Hungry Like the Wolf" and several other Duran Duran videos into heavy rotation, pushing the single and album into the US top twenty in early 1983. The ballad "Save a Prayer" also did well.{{sfn|Denisoff|1986|pp=364–365}} "The band was a natural for music television," noted ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. "They may be the first rock group to ride in on a video wave."{{sfn|Denisoff|1986|p=365}} The album ultimately peaked at number six in the US and remained on the charts there for 129 weeks. In 2003, ''Rio'' was listed at number 65 in the ''[[NME]]''{{'s}} list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nmes_100_best_albums.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202225144/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nmes_100_best_albums.htm|url-status=usurped|title=Rocklist.net...NME Writers Lists...|archive-date=2 February 2015|website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk|access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref>

Duran Duran were among the earliest bands to work on their own [[remix]]es. Before the days of digital synthesizer and easy [[sampling (music)|audio sampling]], they created multi-layered arrangements of their singles, sometimes recording entirely different extended performances of the songs in the studio. These "night versions" were generally available only on [[gramophone record|vinyl]] as [[A-side and B-side|b-sides]] to 45 rpm singles or on 12-inch club singles until the release of the compilation ''[[Night Versions: The Essential Duran Duran]]'' in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |date=31 March 1998<!--from application/ld+json schema--> |access-date=16 September 2025 |title=Night Versions: The Essential Duran Duran – Duran Duran |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r342815|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Larkin |first=Colin |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-85712-595-8 |edition=5th concise |author-link=Colin Larkin (writer)}}</ref>

To satisfy America's appetite for their music,<ref name="Green" /> the band re-released their eponymous first album in the US in the middle of the year with the addition of the new single "[[Is There Something I Should Know?]]". Upon its release, this song entered the chart at number one in the UK (a rarity then and their first [[chart-topper]] in their home country) and reached number five on the American charts. During the promotion of this album, Rhodes and Le Bon were MTV guest [[VJ (media personality)|VJs]] for a show, during which artist and admirer [[Andy Warhol]] dropped by to greet them. "Our first gigs in the United States were crazy and culty", Rhodes said later, "But when we came back after 'Hungry' was a hit, it was mayhem. It was [[Beatlemania]].

The new album, ''[[Seven and the Ragged Tiger]]'' (1983), included the late 1983 hit "[[Union of the Snake]]" (with the soprano saxophone solo by [[Andy Hamilton (pop saxophonist)|Andy Hamilton]]). With "Hungry Like the Wolf", "Rio", "Save a Prayer" and "Is There Something I Should Know?", Duran Duran now had five US Top Twenty hits from three different albums in a single year. The band made music headlines by deciding to release the "Union of the Snake" video to MTV a full week before the single was released to radio. They followed up with "[[New Moon on Monday]]", which reached number nine in the UK. Their next single "[[The Reflex]]", taken from ''Seven and the Ragged Tiger'' and given a significant remix overhaul by [[Nile Rodgers]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]] fame, became their first number one hit in the United States. "The Reflex" was also their second and final [[List of number-one singles (UK)|UK number one]] and was successful in numerous other countries around the world.

The band embarked on a global tour that continued throughout the first four months of 1984 including their first major stadium dates in America. A film crew led by director Russell Mulcahy followed the band closely, leading to the documentary film ''[[Sing Blue Silver]]'' and the accompanying [[concert film]] ''[[Arena (An Absurd Notion)|Arena]]''. The live album ''[[Arena (Duran Duran album)|Arena]]'' was also recorded during the tour and was released with the new single "[[The Wild Boys (song)|The Wild Boys]]", which went to number two on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. In February 1984, the band appeared on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine and won two [[Grammy Award]]s in the brand-new [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video|Long Form]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Short Form]] music video categories. Meanwhile, "[[Save a Prayer]]" gained momentum in North America, and a special US remix of the song became a single in January 1985. It peaked at number 16 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in March. A live version of the song was used for the single's B-side, taken from the concert video footage for ''Arena'' / ''[[As the Lights Go Down]]''.

During this period, all of the band members became heartthrobs for many of their young teenage fans. After the tour, Roger Taylor was married in [[Naples]], [[Italy]], and Rhodes wed in London, wearing a pink velvet tuxedo and top hat.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last = Hauptfuhrer|first = Fred |title = Wedding bells toll for Duran Duran's Nick Rhodes, who marries an Iowa heiress|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date = 3 September 1985 |url = http://www.lizardkingduran.com/wedding.html | access-date =18 May 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070412062952/http://www.lizardkingduran.com/wedding.html |archive-date = 12 April 2007}}</ref> At the end of 1984, the group featured on the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] benefit single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" along with other popular British and Irish musical acts. Le Bon sang fourth on the song, after [[Paul Young]], [[Boy George]] and [[George Michael]] sing their lines.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Flashback: Band Aid Raises Millions With 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/do-they-know-its-christmas-band-aid-1984-geldof-761428/ |access-date=27 November 2021 |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-date=27 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211127041125/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/do-they-know-its-christmas-band-aid-1984-geldof-761428/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Even with Duran Duran on hold, band members were soon anxious to record new music, leading to a supposedly temporary split into two side projects. John Taylor and Andy Taylor wanted to break away from the Duran Duran sound and pursue hard rock material; they collaborated with lead vocalist [[Robert Palmer]] and [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s drummer [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]] to form the rock/[[funk]] supergroup [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]], releasing two top 10 singles. Le Bon and Rhodes wanted to further explore Duran Duran's atmospheric aspect and formed [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]], releasing one album (''[[So Red the Rose (album)|So Red the Rose]]'') and an accompanying single ("[[Election Day (song)|Election Day]]"). Contributors to that album included guitarist [[Masami Tsuchiya (singer)|Masami Tsuchiya]], bassist [[Mark Egan]], percussionist [[David Van Tieghem]], drummer [[Steve Jordan (drummer)|Steve Jordan]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[David Gilmour]] of [[Pink Floyd]]. Roger Taylor was a drummer for Arcadia as well as contributing percussion to the Power Station album. According to Rhodes, the two side projects "were commercial suicide... But we've always been good at that."<ref name=Blender/> The band regrouped to contribute "[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]" to the 1985 [[James Bond]] film [[A View to a Kill|of the same name]]. This single was the first [[James Bond music|Bond theme]] to go to number one on the US charts, and was at the time the joint highest-placed Bond theme on the UK chart where it reached number two. It was the last single the band recorded as the original five-piece for close to twenty years.

As a follow-up to the Christmas 1984 Band Aid single, Duran Duran performed in front of 90,000 people (and an estimated 1.5&nbsp;billion TV viewers) at the [[Live Aid]] charity concert at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, on 13 July 1985 while their Bond song held the top spot on the American charts. It was not intended to be a farewell performance—the band planned only to take a break after four years of non-stop touring and public appearances—but the original five did not play live together again until July 2003. During their Live Aid set, Le Bon inadvertently hit an off-key [[falsetto]] note in the chorus of "A View to a Kill", an error that was trumpeted by numerous media outlets as "The Bum Note Heard Round the World"<ref name="mckee">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/feature/a658048/30-fun-facts-for-the-30th-birthday-of-live-aid/|title=30 fun facts for the 30th birthday of Live Aid|last=McKee|first=Briony|date=13 July 2015|website=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|access-date=15 February 2016|archive-date=11 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211085443/http://www.digitalspy.com/music/feature/a658048/30-fun-facts-for-the-30th-birthday-of-live-aid/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="jones">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Dylan|author-link=Dylan Jones|date=26 July 2010|title=The Eighties: One Day, One Decade|publisher=[[Random House]]|page=357|isbn=978-1-4090-5225-8|quote=The [Duran] Duran set was memorable for Simon Le Bon's off-key falsetto note that he hit during 'A View to a Kill', a blunder that echoed throughout the media as 'The Bum Note Heard Round the World'.

===1986–1989: Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor trio===
[[File:Duran Duran 1986.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Duran Duran as a trio, in 1986]]
After releasing three studio albums and one live album in five years, each accompanied by heavy media promotion and lengthy concert tours, the band lost two of its core members to fatigue and tension in 1986. After Live Aid and Arcadia, Roger Taylor left the band and retired to the English countryside, suffering from exhaustion.{{sfn|Malins|2005|p=181}}

Andy Taylor led the remaining members to believe he would return to work on a new Duran Duran album, even as he was signing a solo recording contract in Los Angeles with [[MCA Records]], eventually releasing a solo album in 1986 called ''[[Thunder (Andy Taylor album)|Thunder]]''. The band resorted to legal measures to get him into the studio but after numerous delays they let him go at last. He played on only a few songs on the next album, including "A Matter of Feeling", whilst the disagreements were being settled.{{sfn|Malins|2005|pp=187–190}}

Without a guitarist or a drummer, Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor had producer (and former Chic guitarist) [[Nile Rodgers]] play a few tracks on guitar, and hired [[Steve Ferrone]] to play drums while they searched for replacements. In September 1986, [[Warren Cuccurullo]] (formerly of [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]] and [[Frank Zappa]]'s band) was hired as a session guitarist.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|date=7 August 1987|title=Forth Worth Stare-Telegram, 07 Aug 1987|pages=112|work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67030198/forth-worth-stare-telegram-07-aug-1987/|access-date=7 January 2021|archive-date=7 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210107193902/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67030198/forth-worth-stare-telegram-07-aug-1987/|url-status=live}}</ref> With Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor, he recorded the rest of the ''[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]'' album, which was released in October 1986. The black-and-white documentary film ''Three to Get Ready'' chronicled the recording of the album, legal tensions, and preparations for the tour.

Although the song "[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]" was a US and UK top ten hit, the album was a relative failure globally, reaching number 16 in the UK and spending one week in the top 50 album chart. The band found they had lost much of the momentum and hysteria they had left behind in 1985. In the three years between the release of ''Seven and the Ragged Tiger'' and ''Notorious'', many of their teenage fans had grown up and the music was funkier, more mature, and less "pop", given the added experience of their work on Arcadia and Power Station and with other musicians. "[[Skin Trade (song)|Skin Trade]]" and "[[Meet El Presidente]]", the two subsequent singles, made the charts but fared poorly compared to the band's earlier successes. Finally in late 1987, [[Sterling Campbell]] was hired as a session drummer.

Subsequently, Duran Duran struggled to escape the [[teen idol]] image and gain respect among critics with more complex music. The new serious image was not accepted at first and their popularity began to wane. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, "In their search for musical maturity, the surviving Durans have lost a good deal of their identity."<ref>{{Cite magazine |last = Coleman |first = Mark |title = Review of ''Notorious'' |magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] |publisher = Wenner Publishing |date = 29 January 1987 |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/179366/review/5946832 |access-date = 14 May 2007 |archive-date = 20 May 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090520165931/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/179366/review/5946832 |url-status = dead }}</ref> In contrast the ''New York Times'' said, "Duran Duran's newfound disillusionment may mark a step toward maturity...they managed to catch a trend on the upswing, perhaps "Notorious" suggests that for late 1980s grit and pessimism is coming into style."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/arts/a-smaller-duran-duran-finds-disillusionment.html|title=A Smaller Duran Duran Finds Disillusionment|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=7 December 1986|work=The New York Times|access-date=8 January 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=8 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108145508/https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/arts/a-smaller-duran-duran-finds-disillusionment.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Another factor was the band's dismissal of early managers, the Berrow brothers. There was no announcement of the reasons for the decision, but disagreements over money, and the brothers' involvement in Le Bon's yachting adventures (they were co-owners of ''[[Drum (yacht)|Drum]]'') were thought to have played a part.{{sfn|Malins|2005|p=174}} Whatever the reason, Duran Duran switched managers frequently and undertook periods of self-management in the later stages of their career. In addition, EMI fired its president and went through a major corporate restructuring that summer and seemed to have lost interest in promoting the band.{{sfn|Malins|2005|p=186}} According to Rhodes the band needed to break up in order to come back together stronger.<ref name="auto"/>

The next album ''[[Big Thing (Duran Duran album)|Big Thing]]'' (1988) yielded the singles "[[I Don't Want Your Love]]" (number four in the US), and "[[All She Wants Is]]" (the last top ten hit in the UK until 1993). The record was experimental, mixing influences from [[house music]] and [[rave]]s with Duran's atmospheric [[synth-pop]] and the creative guitar work of Cuccurullo (now a full band member), as well as more mature lyrics.

===1989–1991: Five again, ''Decade'' and ''Liberty''===
[[File:WarrenCuccurulloMar09.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Warren Cuccurullo in 2009|After contributing to the band for three years, [[Warren Cuccurullo]] (pictured in 2009) was made a full-time member of Duran Duran in 1989.]]
By the end of 1989 and at the start of the 1990s, the popularity of synth-pop was fading and losing fans to other momentum-gaining music genres at the time, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[techno]] and [[alternative rock]]. After touring for the album finished, the band regained a five-man membership as Cuccurullo and Campbell were made full members of Duran Duran.<ref>

The compilation album ''[[Decade (Duran Duran album)|Decade]]'' was released late in 1989, along with the [[megamix]] single "[[Burning the Ground]]", which consisted of woven snippets of the band's hits from the previous ten years, created and produced with [[John Jones (record producer)|John Jones]], who began working with the band after the release of ''Big Thing''. The single came and went with little fanfare, but the album became another major seller for the band. The 1990 release ''[[Liberty (Duran Duran album)|Liberty]]'' (a retreat from the experimentation of ''Big Thing'') failed to capitalise on any regained momentum. The album entered the UK album chart in the top ten, but faded away quickly. The singles "[[Violence of Summer (Love's Taking Over)]]" and "[[Serious (Duran Duran song)|Serious]]" were only mildly successful. For the first time, Duran Duran did not tour in support of an album, performing on only a handful of club dates and TV shows.{{sfn|Malins|2005|p=213}} Campbell left the band early in 1991, going on to work with [[Soul Asylum]] and [[David Bowie]]. The quartet of Le Bon, Rhodes, John Taylor and Cuccurullo would remain intact for six more years.

===1992–1996: Quartet line-up and a brief comeback===
In 1993, the band released a second self-titled album: this ''[[Duran Duran (1993 album)|Duran Duran]]'' album is known as ''The Wedding Album'' (for [[Nick Egan]]'s cover art featuring the wedding photos of the band members' parents) to distinguish it from the 1981 release, and was produced and recorded with [[John Jones (record producer)|John Jones]]. The release of this first "comeback" album was delayed, with then manager at Left Bank, Tommy Manzi, later telling [[HitQuarters]] that this was due to industry resistance to the revival of the band, who he said would rather focus on "the next hip band".<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_TManzi.html |title=Interview With Tommy Manzi |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=7 May 2001 |access-date=6 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609212527/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_TManzi.html |archive-date=9 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Listener demand for leaked single "[[Ordinary World (song)|Ordinary World]]" forced it onto radio playlists months earlier than planned; it reached number three on the US chart and number six in the UK and won a prestigious [[Ivor Novello Award]] for song writing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synentertainment.com/2001/main/2000/corpo/c-2001/corporate-f-directors.html |title=Simon Le Bon bio |publisher=Syn Entertainment corporate website |access-date=16 May 2007 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928085135/http://www.synentertainment.com/2001/main/2000/corpo/c-2001/corporate-f-directors.html |archive-date=28 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=22 October 1993|title=The Record, 22 Oct 1993 (Duran Duran)|pages=112|work=The Record|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67030507/the-record-22-oct-1993-duran-duran/|access-date=7 January 2021|archive-date=22 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210522075550/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67030507/the-record-22-oct-1993-duran-duran/|url-status=live}}</ref>

"[[Come Undone (Duran Duran song)|Come Undone]]", primarily written by Cuccurullo, with lyrics by Le Bon, made number seven in the US and number 13 in the UK. Both the band and the record label seemed to be caught by surprise by the album's critical and commercial success (number four in the UK, number seven in the US). John Taylor had been considering leaving the band but changed his mind. The band's largest tour ever, which included stops in the Middle East, the then recently de-embargoed South Africa, and South America, was halted after seven months when Le Bon suffered from strained [[vocal cords]]. After six weeks' recuperation, the band performed intermittently for another five months, including appearances in Israel, Thailand, and Indonesia.

In 1995, the band released the cover album ''[[Thank You (Duran Duran album)|Thank You]]''. Songs from ''Thank You'' included covers of [[Lou Reed]]'s "[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]" and [[Melle Mel]]'s "[[White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)]]" (with backing vocals from the original artists). The album also marked the temporary return of former drummer Roger Taylor, who joined the band in studio to play drums on "[[Watching the Detectives (song)|Watching the Detectives]]" and "Perfect Day" (as well as a cover of "[[Jeepster (song)|Jeepster]]" by [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] that did not appear on the album). In a video interview provided with the album's [[electronic press kit]], Reed said he considered Duran Duran's version the best cover ever done of one of his songs, and they received praise from [[Robert Plant]] and [[Jimmy Page]] for their cover of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]".<ref name=Edwards />

===1997–2000: John Taylor's departure and second trio===
After the promo tour for ''Thank You'' was completed, John Taylor co-founded the B5 Records label, recorded a solo album, founded and toured with the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Neurotic Outsiders]], and reunited the Power Station, though the project proceeded without him when he had to withdraw to deal with his divorce. Finally, after struggling for months to record the next album, ''[[Medazzaland]]'', in January 1997, John Taylor announced at the DuranCon [[fan convention]] that he was leaving the band "for good".<ref>{{Cite magazine|last = Green|first = Michelle|title = Duran Duran Comes Undone|magazine = [[Rolling Stone]]|publisher = Wenner Publishing|date = 23 January 1997|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johntaylor2/articles/story/5924427/duran_duran_comes_undone|access-date = 18 May 2007|archive-date = 14 April 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090414131052/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johntaylor2/articles/story/5924427/duran_duran_comes_undone|url-status = dead}}</ref> His departure reduced the band to two long time members (Le Bon and Rhodes) and Cuccurullo, who decided to continue recording under the name Duran Duran.

Freed from some internal writing conflicts, the band returned to the studio to rewrite and re-record many of the songs on ''Medazzaland'' (John Taylor's work remains on only four tracks). The album marked a return to the layered experimentation of ''Big Thing'', with intricate guitar textures and processed vocals. The track "[[Out of My Mind (Duran Duran song)|Out of My Mind]]" was used as the theme song for the film ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]'' (1997), but the only true single to be released in the United States was the quirky "[[Electric Barbarella]]", which is one of the first singles ever to be sold online.{{sfn|Haring|2000|pp=77–79}} The music video for this single, featuring a sexy robot purchased and played with by band members, had to be censored before airing on MTV, but there was little of the controversy that had surrounded "Girls on Film". "Electric Barbarella" peaked at number 52 in the US in October 1997.{{sfn|Malins|2005|p=246}} Although ''Medazzaland'' was released in the US in October 1997, the album was never released in the UK. "Electric Barbarella" was later released in the UK as a single from the 1998 ''[[Greatest (Duran Duran)|Greatest]]'' compilation album and peaked at number 23 on the UK chart in January 1999. The group played a set at the Princess Diana Tribute Concert on 27 June 1998 by special request of her family.<ref>{{cite news |title=Thousands in party tribute to Diana |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/121635.stm |work=BBC News |date=28 June 1998 |access-date=18 May 2007 |archive-date=14 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814020215/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/121635.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>

Duran Duran parted ways with Capitol/EMI in 1999, although the label has since used Duran Duran's back catalogue to release several compilations of remixes and rare vinyl-only B-sides. The band then signed what was intended to be a three-album contract with [[Disney Music Group]]'s [[Hollywood Records]], but it lasted only through the poorly received 2000 album ''[[Pop Trash]]''. This slow-paced and heavy album seemed out-of-keeping with earlier band material.{{sfn|Malins|2005|p=256}} Rhodes' intricate production and Cuccurullo's songwriting and experimentation with guitar sounds and time signatures were not enough to hook the public, and the album did not perform well. The dreamy single "[[Someone Else Not Me]]" lasted barely two weeks on the radio, although its video was noted as the first to be produced entirely with [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animation. While supporting ''Medazzaland'' and ''Pop Trash'', Duran Duran toured with bassist [[Wes Wehmiller]] and drummer Joe Travers.

===2001–2005: Reunion===
[[File:Duran Duran.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Duran Duran performing live at [[Scotiabank Arena]] in [[Toronto]], Canada, 2005]]
In 2000, Le Bon approached John Taylor with a proposal to reform Duran Duran's classic line-up. They agreed to part company with Cuccurullo after completing the ''Pop Trash'' tour. Cuccurullo then announced on his website that he was leaving Duran Duran to resume work with his 1980s band [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]]. This announcement was confirmed the next day by Duran Duran's website, followed a day later by the news that John, Roger and Andy had rejoined. To fulfill contractual obligations, Cuccurullo played three Duran Duran concerts in Japan in June 2001, ending his tenure in the band.

Throughout 2001, 2002 and 2003, the band worked on writing new material, initially renting a house in [[Saint-Tropez]] where audio engineer [[Mark Tinley]] built a recording studio for their first serious writing session. They then returned to London to do some self-financed work with various producers (including old friend Nile Rodgers) and search for a new record deal. It proved difficult to find a record label willing to gamble on the band's comeback, so Duran Duran went on tour to prove the drawing power of the reunited band. The response of the fans and the media exceeded expectations.<ref name="Sandall">{{Cite news|last=Sandall|first=Robert|date=17 September 2004|title=Cover Story: The old romantics|work=The Independent|location=UK|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040917/ai_n12808730/pg_1|url-status=dead|access-date=18 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012195000/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040917/ai_n12808730/pg_1|archive-date=12 October 2007}}</ref> The band played a handful of 25th-anniversary dates across 2003, starting with two arena dates in Tokyo filled to capacity. Tickets sold out for each show within minutes, and celebrities turned out ''en masse'' for reunion dates. Amongst these were a number of shows at smaller venues that the band had played on both sides of the pond when they first got together in the early 1980s. In August, the band were booked as presenters at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]], only to be surprised with a [[MTV Video Vanguard Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]]. They also received a Lifetime Achievement award from ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine in October, and the equivalent Outstanding Contribution award at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2004.<ref name="OConnell">{{Cite news| first=John |last=O'Connell |title= Old Romantics |url= http://www.sundayherald.com/41173 |work=[[Sunday Herald]] | publisher=Newsquest |date=11 April 2004 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040508202943/http://www.sundayherald.com/41173 |archive-date = 8 May 2004}}</ref>

The pace picked up with a sold-out tour of America, Australia and New Zealand. The band played a full concert at a private tailgate party at [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], their performance of "The Wild Boys" broadcast to millions during the pre-game show. A [[remix]] of the new track "[[(Reach Up for The) Sunrise]]" was released on many TV shows in February while magazines hailed (the modern "Fab Five") Duran Duran as one of the greatest bands of all time.<ref name="Ferber">{{Cite news |first=Lawrence |last=Ferber |title=Wild Boys take 2 |url=http://www.southernvoice.com/2004/10-29/arts/feature/wildboy.cfm |work=[[Southern Voice (newspaper)|Southern Voice]] |publisher=[[Window Media]] |date=29 October 2004 |access-date=19 May 2007 |archive-date=6 May 2006 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060506091147/http://www.southernvoice.com/2004/10-29/arts/feature/wildboy.cfm |url-status=live }}</ref> Duran Duran then celebrated their homecoming to the UK with fourteen stadium dates in April 2004, including five sold-out nights at [[Wembley Arena]]. The British press, traditionally hostile to the band, accorded the shows some very warm reviews.{{sfn|Malins|2005|pp=273–274}} Duran Duran brought along band [[Goldfrapp]] and the [[Scissor Sisters]] as alternating opening acts for this tour.<ref name="Sandall" /> The last two shows were filmed, resulting in the concert DVD ''[[Live from London (Duran Duran)|Duran Duran: Live from London]]'' which was released in November.

Finally, with more than thirty-five songs completed, the band signed a two-album contract with [[Epic Records]] in June, and completed the new album, now titled ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]''. The album was released in October 2004 and entered the UK charts at number three and the US charts at number 17. The first single was "[[(Reach Up for The) Sunrise]]", which reached number one on the ''Billboard'' US Dance chart in November and peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, Duran Duran's highest chart position since "A View to a Kill" in 1985. A second single, "[[What Happens Tomorrow]]", debuted at No.&nbsp;11 on the UK chart in February. A 5.1 mix of ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'' was created by Jeremy Wheatley for the dual-disc release of ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]''. The CD side contains the album as-is and the DVD side contains the 5.1 mix of the album in DVD Audio format along with some DVD footage and videos.

After a world tour in early 2005, Duran Duran were presented with the PRS Outstanding Contribution to British Music at the 2005 Ivor Novello Awards. Later that summer, the band headlined the massive [[Live 8 concert, Rome]] on 2 July 2005 in the [[Circus Maximus]].

===2006–2008: ''Red Carpet Massacre'' and Andy Taylor's second departure===
[[File:Duran Duran Bogota 2008.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Duran Duran in [[Bogotá]], Colombia, 2008]]
In early 2006, Duran Duran covered [[John Lennon]]'s song "[[Instant Karma!]]" for the ''Make Some Noise'' campaign sponsored by [[Amnesty International]]. Their version later appeared on ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]'' as an [[iTunes]] exclusive bonus track. They also performed at two high-profile events&nbsp;– the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize Awards]] and the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. After a couple of weeks of songwriting in Northern California, the band began working with producer [[Michael Patterson (producer)|Michael Patterson]] in London, and continued intermittently for the next several months. At one point, they reported having had fifteen tracks nearly complete for an album tentatively titled ''[[Reportage (album)|Reportage]]'', but no further news emerged from the band for months afterward. In September, the band held meetings in New York City with [[Justin Timberlake]] and producer [[Timbaland]] with an eye to a potential collaboration and were soon reported to have completed three songs with the producer, including a song with [[Justin Timberlake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhnlive.com/news/more/430.html |title=Duran Duran and Timbaland |date=10 March 2006 |website=HHNLive.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108101746/http://www.hhnlive.com/news/more/430.html |archive-date=8 November 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 25 October 2006, Duran Duran parted company with Andy Taylor once again. In an official announcement on their website, the band stated that an "unworkable gulf" had developed between them and Taylor and that "we can no longer effectively function together". It was noted by Andy Taylor in his book ''Wild Boy'' that tensions had arisen between the group's management and himself, and he was also diagnosed with clinical depression connected with the death of his father. [[Dominic Brown|Dom Brown]], who had previously toured with the band, again took over guitar duties and has been performing with them since.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dombrown.com/ |title= Dominic Brown: Musician with Duran Duran |publisher= dombrown.com |access-date= 16 May 2006 |archive-date= 9 May 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060509165318/http://www.dombrown.com/ |url-status= live }}</ref> After Taylor's departure, the band scrapped the ''Reportage'' album. They wrote and recorded a new album titled ''[[Red Carpet Massacre]]'' (2007), which included the Timbaland tracks. Dom Brown is the featured guitarist on the album.

In July 2007, the band performed twice at [[Wembley Stadium]]. Their first appearance at the stadium was the [[Concert for Diana]] which celebrated the life of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] almost 10 years after her death. The band performed "[[(Reach Up for The) Sunrise]]", "[[The Wild Boys (song)|The Wild Boys]]" and "[[Rio (song)|Rio]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/webarchive/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fconcertfordiana%2Ftimeline |title=Concert for Diana – What happened minute by minute |work=BBC News |access-date=4 July 2013 |archive-date=31 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731124144/http://www.bbc.co.uk/concertfordiana/timeline/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Their second appearance was at [[Live Earth concert, London]]. On 25 September, the Timberlake collaboration "[[Falling Down (Duran Duran song)|Falling Down]]" was released as a download single on [[iTunes]], and the band announced that they would play nine shows at the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] on Broadway to launch the ''Red Carpet Massacre'' album. The album launch was later extended to incorporate a show in London on 3 December 2007 and one in Dublin on 5 December 2007.

In May 2008, they toured the US leg of their 2008 world tour and were supported by the British band [[Your Vegas]]. In June 2008, they played the [[Louvre]] in Paris in a fundraising effort that contributed to the restoration of a [[Louis XV]] drawing room. Guests dined, privately viewed some of the museum's artworks, then attended a performance by the band in the [[I.M. Pei]]-designed [[Louvre Pyramid|Pyramid du Louvre]]. The group's performance marked a first for the 18th-century museum which had never before allowed a rock concert to occur anywhere within the grounds or buildings and another groundbreaker for Duran Duran.

On 2 July 2008, in Paris, [[Mark Ronson]] performed a unique live set with Duran Duran for an exclusive, invitation-only performance. Together, they showcased specially re-worked versions of some of Duran Duran's classic hits re-created by Ronson, along with tracks from ''Red Carpet Massacre''. Le Bon also performed songs from Ronson's latest album, ''[[Version (album)|Version]]'' (2007), as one of Ronson's featured guest vocalists. Unlike the band's previous album ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'' (2004), ''Red Carpet Massacre'' sold poorly and received mixed responses from the music press. In 2008, ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'' was included in the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' series.

===2009–2012: ''All You Need Is Now''===
[[File:Duran Duran (6874514374).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Duran Duran performing live at the [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]], Australia, 2012]]
The band departed from Epic Records in 2009, after releasing just two albums. In early 2010, it was revealed that the band would be contributing a cover of "[[Boys Keep Swinging]]" to a tribute/charity record for [[David Bowie]] called ''[[We Were So Turned On: A Tribute to David Bowie|We Were So Turned On]]'' from which all profits go to [[War Child (charity)|War Child]]. Other contributing artists included [[Carla Bruni]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros]], and [[Warpaint (band)|Warpaint]]. The album was released on 14 September 2010 on [[Manimal Vinyl]] Records. A limited edition split 7-inch single with Duran Duran and [[Carla Bruni]] was also released on [[Manimal Vinyl]] in December 2010.

On 21 December 2010, Duran Duran's thirteenth album, titled ''[[All You Need Is Now]]'', produced by the [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[Mark Ronson]] and mixed by [[Spike Stent]], was released exclusively on [[iTunes]] and hit the number one spot on download charts in 15 countries (including the UK).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17851 |title=ALL YOU NEED IS NOW Out in the UK on March&nbsp;21 |publisher=Duran Duran |date=18 February 2011 |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-date=21 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221014238/http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17851 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first single from the record, title track "All You Need Is Now", was free to download worldwide on 8 December 2010 exclusively in iTunes.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} Guitarist and songwriter [[Dominic Brown|Dom Brown]] co-wrote all but two songs on the album.

On 25 February 2011, while in Milan, Duran Duran received a Style Icons of the 20th Century Award and a key to the city, presented by the city's mayor [[Letizia Moratti]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17885 |title=Receive Style Award in Milan |publisher=Duran Duran |date=25 February 2011 |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-date=27 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227023656/http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17885 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17883 |title=Mayor of Milan Honors Duran Duran as 20th-Century Style Icons |publisher=Duran Duran |date=25 February 2011 |access-date=13 April 2011 |archive-date=27 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227023623/http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/?p=17883 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 2011 the band embarked on a world tour in support of the album. After a warm-up show in London, the tour officially began 16 March 2011 in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|title=tour|url=http://duranduranmusic.com/?page=tour|access-date=13 April 2011|publisher=Duran Duran Music|archive-date=23 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423224152/http://duranduranmusic.com/?page=Tour|url-status=live}}</ref> On 23 March, the band performed live at the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles as the start of the second season of ''[[Unstaged: An Original Series from American Express]]''. The concert was directed by [[David Lynch]] and [[Streaming media|live-streamed]] on YouTube. The band was joined onstage by [[Gerard Way]] of [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Beth Ditto]] of [[Gossip (band)|Gossip]], and [[Kelis]].<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Appleford | first = Steve | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/duran-duran-and-david-lynch-collaborate-on-spectacular-l-a-concert-20110324 | title = Duran Duran and David Lynch Collaborate on Spectacular L.A.

On 27 July 2012, Duran Duran headlined the London [[2012 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics 2012]] Opening Ceremony celebration in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].

===2013–2018: ''Paper Gods''===
On 4 March 2013, the band returned to the studio to work on their fourteenth album, and continued during the week beginning 23 September. They reconvened 13 to 18 December. On 31 December 2013, the band posted a mixtape curated by John Taylor as a New Year's "thank you" to their fans. On 10 February 2014, John Taylor and Roger Taylor worked with the [[Voce Chamber Choir]] and London Youth Chamber Choir on vocals for use on some Duran Duran tracks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/new-site-timeline/ |title=Duran Duran Timeline |publisher=Duran Duran |access-date=28 March 2014 |archive-date=17 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317051908/http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/new-site-timeline/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Then former [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarist [[John Frusciante]] worked with the band on the new album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Duran Duran Timeline|date=24 April 2014 |url=http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/2014/john-fruscinate-duran-duran/|publisher=Duran Duran|access-date=5 October 2014|archive-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006184606/http://www.duranduran.com/wordpress/2014/john-fruscinate-duran-duran/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Videos==
The [[MTV]] cable channel and the band were launched around the same time, and each had a hand in propelling the other to greater heights.{{sfn|Denisoff|1986|p=365: "Duran Duran became multimedia stars because MTV, to paraphrase bassist John Taylor, could not get videos of 'Stairway to Heaven'"}} MTV needed showcase videos with charismatic performers. [[Les Garland]], senior executive vice-president at MTV, said "I remember our director of talent and artist relations came running in and said, "You have got to see this video that's come in". Duran Duran were getting zero radio airplay at the time, and MTV wanted to try to break new music. "Hungry Like the Wolf" was the greatest video I'd ever seen".<ref name=Blender/> The band's video work was influential in several ways. First, Duran Duran filmed in exotic locales like [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Antigua]], creating memorable images that were radically different from the then-common low budget "band-playing-on-a-stage" videos. Second, rather than simply playing their instruments, the band participated in mini-storylines (often taking inspiration from contemporary movies: "Hungry Like the Wolf" riffs on 1981's ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', "The Wild Boys" on 1981's ''[[Mad Max 2]]''), etc. While videos were already headed in this direction, Duran Duran led the trend with a style, featuring quick editing, arresting graphic design, and surreal-to-nonsensical image inserts, that drew attention from commentators and spawned a wealth of imitators.

Duran Duran were among the first bands to have their videos shot with a professional movie camera on 35mm film, rather than on videotape, making them look superior to many of the quickly shot videos which had been MTV staples until then. MTV provided Duran Duran with access to American radio markets that were unfriendly to British music, new wave music, or "anything with synthesisers". Because MTV was not available everywhere in the United States at first, it was easy to see a pattern: where MTV went, listener demand for Duran Duran, [[Tears for Fears]], [[Def Leppard]] and other European bands with interesting videos went through the roof.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/musictelevis/musictelevis.htm |title=Music Television |access-date=17 May 2007 |author=Burns, Gary |publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |archive-date=31 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531225420/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/musictelevis/musictelevis.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The band's sun-drenched videos for "Rio", "Hungry Like the Wolf" and "Save a Prayer", and the surreal "Is There Something I Should Know?" were filmed by future movie director [[Russell Mulcahy]], who made eleven videos for the band. Duran Duran have always sought out innovative directors and techniques, even in their later years when MTV gave them little airplay. In addition to Mulcahy, they have had videos filmed by influential photographers [[Dean Chamberlain]] and [[Ellen von Unwerth]], Chinese director [[Chen Kaige]], documentary filmmaker [[Julien Temple]], and the [[Polish Brothers]], among others. According to Rhodes, "Video is to us like stereo was to [[Pink Floyd]]."{{sfn|Denisoff|1986|p=364}}

{{Blockquote|"The British won out here, hands down. Next to the prosaic, foursquare appearance of the American bands, such acts as Duran Duran seemed like caviar. MTV opened up a whole new world that could not be fully apprehended over the radio. The visual angle played to the arty conceits of Britain's young style barons, suggesting something more exotic than the viewer was likely to find in the old hometown. The big Duran Duran hits, "[[Girls on Film]]" and "[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]", were MTV favorites three months before radio began to pick up on them. And via MTV, Duran Duran and their like have engendered an outpouring of good old-fashioned hysteria among teenage girls."|source="Anglomania: The [[Second British Invasion]]", by Parke Puterbaugh for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', November 1983.<ref name=RS/>}}

In 1984, Duran Duran introduced video technology into their live stadium shows by being among the first acts to provide video screens above the stage.<ref name="DD Videos">{{cite news|title=50 things you may not know about Duran Duran|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/50-things-you-may-not-know-235647|work=Birmingham Mail|date=13 September 2016|access-date=13 September 2016|archive-date=20 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920053436/http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/50-things-you-may-not-know-235647|url-status=live}}</ref> They have recorded concerts using [[IMAX]] and 360-degree panoramic "immersive video" cameras, with 10.2 channel audio.

MTV named "Hungry" the 15th of their most played videos of all time.

The band has released several video compilations, starting with the self-titled "video album" ''[[Duran Duran (1983 video)|Duran Duran]]'' (1983), for which they won a [[Grammy Award]], up to the 2004 two-disc DVD release ''[[Greatest (Duran Duran)#DVD|Greatest]]'', which included alternative versions of several popular videos as [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]]. In addition to ''Greatest'', the documentary ''[[Sing Blue Silver]]'', and the concert film ''[[Arena (An Absurd Notion)|Arena]]'' (both from 1984) were released on DVD in 2004. ''[[Live from London (Duran Duran)|Live from London]]'', a concert video from one of their sold-out 2004 reunion shows at Wembley Arena, was released in the fall of 2005.

Other video collections, concert films, and documentaries remain available only on videotape, and Duran Duran have not yet released a collection which includes all their videos. The band has said that a huge amount of unreleased concert and documentary footage has been filmed over the years, which they hope can be edited and released in some form in the near future. The video for "Falling Down" was released in October 2007. The Nick Egan-directed video for the lead single and title track from ''All You Need Is Now'' was premiered via Yahoo Music on 20 December 2010. The second video from ''[[All You Need Is Now]]'', "Girl Panic", was released on 8 November 2011. It features some of the world's most famous supermodels, such as [[Yasmin Le Bon]], [[Cindy Crawford]], [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Eva Herzigová]] and [[Helena Christensen]], playing the band. The video was directed by [[Jonas Akerlund]], and during the filming, an editorial was made for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' magazine.

From the beginning of their career, all the members had a keen sense of visual style. They worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as [[Kahn & Bell]] and [[Antony Price]] to build a sharp and elegant image, soon outgrowing the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured early New Romantic look that had been popularised by [[Adam Ant]] during 1980–81. They have continued to present fashion as part of their package throughout their career. In the 1990s they worked with [[Vivienne Westwood]] and in the 2000s with [[Giorgio Armani]]. The band retained creative control of their visual presentation having worked closely with graphic designer [[Malcolm Garrett]] and many others over the years to create album covers, tour programs and other materials.<ref name=TheirStory>{{Cite book|last=De Graaf |first=Kaspar |author2=Garret, Malcolm |title=Duran Duran: Their Story |year=1982 |publisher=Cherry Lane Books |location=UK |isbn=0-86276-171-9 |page=14}}</ref>

Teen and music magazines in the UK latched onto their good looks quickly, and the USA soon followed. It was a rare month in the early 1980s when there was not at least one picture of the band members in [[teen magazine]]s such as ''[[Smash Hits]]'' or ''[[Tiger Beat]]''. John Taylor once remarked that the band was "like a box of [[Quality Street (confection)|Quality Street]] [chocolates]; everyone is someone's favourite"<ref>De Graaf & Garret (1982), p. 15.</ref> Duran Duran later came to regret this early pin-up exposure, but at the time it helped attract national attention. In an interview with ''Rock Fever Superstars'' magazine in early 1988, John Taylor stated:

<blockquote>We used to be a very chi-chi name to drop in '79, but then the Fab Five hype started and something went wrong. Something went really wrong. That wasn't what I wanted. [...] Not that I didn't like being screamed at. At one point I really did".<ref>Sprague, David: ''The Death of Duran Duran''. Rock Fever Superstars, issue January 1988, p.21</ref></blockquote>

==Legacy==
Although they began their career as "a group of art school, experimental, post punk rockers,"<ref name="Green" /> the band's quick rise to stardom, polished good looks and embrace of the teen press almost guaranteed disfavour from music critics. During the 1980s, Duran Duran were considered the quintessential manufactured, throw-away pop group. According to the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', "To describe them, as some have, as the first [[boy band]], misrepresents their appeal. Their weapons were never just their looks, but self-penned songs."<ref name="OConnell" /> [[Moby]] said of the band in his blog in 2003: "...&nbsp;they were cursed by what we can call the '[[Bee Gees]]' curse, which is: 'write amazing songs, sell tons of records, and consequently incur the wrath or disinterest of the rock obsessed critical establishment.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moby.com/node/4889 |title=Duran Duran |date=31 August 2003 |access-date=17 May 2007 |author=Moby |author-link=Moby |publisher=moby.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141843/http://moby.com/node/4889 |archive-date=12 October 2007 }}</ref>

Several of the band's contemporaries including [[the Bangles]],{{citation needed|date=August 2025}} [[Elton John]],{{citation needed|date=August 2025}} [[Kylie Minogue]],{{citation needed|date=August 2025}} [[Paul Young]],{{citation needed|date=August 2025}} and even [[the Monkees]]{{citation needed|date=August 2025}} have named themselves fans of the band's music.

Rhodes has directly lent his production techniques to [[Kajagoogoo]]'s debut album ''[[White Feathers]]'' (1983) and its number one single "[[Too Shy]]", and to the Dandy Warhols' fourth album ''[[Welcome to the Monkey House (album)|Welcome to the Monkey House]]'' (2003). The band's music has been used by several [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists, most notably [[the Notorious B.I.G.]], who sampled Duran Duran's 1986 single "Notorious".
