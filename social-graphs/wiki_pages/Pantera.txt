'''Pantera''' ({{IPAc-en|p|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɛr|ə}}) is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Arlington, Texas]] in 1981 by the Abbott brothers (guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] and drummer [[Vinnie Paul]]), and currently composed of vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]], bassist [[Rex Brown]], and touring musicians [[Zakk Wylde]] and [[Charlie Benante]]. The group's best-known lineup consisted of the Abbott brothers along with Brown and Anselmo, who joined in 1982 and 1986, respectively. The band is credited for developing and popularizing the subgenre of [[groove metal]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-27 |title=Pantera Share Teaser For Upcoming Reunion Tour, Rex Brown Says "This Is Gonna Be One Hell Of A Ride" |url=https://www.theprp.com/2022/11/26/news/pantera-share-teaser-for-upcoming-reunion-tour-rex-brown-says-this-is-gonna-be-one-hell-of-a-ride/ |access-date=2024-03-10 |website=Theprp.com}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=Cowboys from Hell - Pantera {{!}} Album {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/cowboys-from-hell-mw0000308550 |access-date=2024-03-10 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=March 24, 2020 |title=7 Times Pantera Proved They Were the Kings of Groove Metal |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/articles/features/7_times_pantera_proved_they_were_the_kings_of_groove_metal-104431 |access-date=2024-03-10 |website=[[Ultimate Guitar]]}}</ref> Regarded as one of the most successful and influential bands in heavy metal history, Pantera has sold around 20 million records worldwide<ref name="tshaonline.org">{{cite web|title= Abbott, Vincent Paul [Vinnie Paul] (1964–2018) |url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/abbott-vincent-paul-vinnie-paul |date=November 7, 2019|access-date=August 19, 2021}}</ref> and has received four [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nominations.<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 19, 2019|title=Pantera|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/pantera/7936|access-date=October 17, 2020|website=GRAMMY.com}}</ref>

Having started as a [[glam metal]] band, Pantera released three albums in the mid-1980s with lead vocalist [[Terry Glaze]] (''[[Metal Magic]]'', ''[[Projects in the Jungle]]'', and ''[[I Am the Night (album)|I Am the Night]]''), with little success. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera recruited Anselmo in 1986 and released ''[[Power Metal (album)|Power Metal]]'' in 1988. They secured a record deal with major label [[Atco Records|Atco]] the following year. Their fifth album (which the band has since declared to be their official debut album),<ref name="bio">{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5099|pure_url=yes}} | title = A short biography on Pantera | work = [[AllMusic]] | access-date = January 3, 2008}}</ref> ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'' (1990), popularized the [[groove metal]] genre, while its follow-up ''[[Vulgar Display of Power]]'' (1992) achieved an even heavier sound and increased their popularity. The subsequent seventh studio album ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'' (1994) debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="200chart">{{cite web|url=https://allmusic.com/artist/pantera-p5099/charts-awards?table=SEARCH | title = Pantera Chart Positions – Albums| website = [[AllMusic]]|access-date = December 23, 2011}}</ref>

Tensions began to surface among the band members when Anselmo, reeling from severe back problems brought on by years of intense on-stage performances, began growing distant from his bandmates in 1995, eventually becoming addicted to [[heroin]] as a result of his pain issues (he almost died from an [[overdose]] in July 1996). These tensions resulted in the recording sessions for ''[[The Great Southern Trendkill]]'' (1996) being held separately. The ongoing tension lasted for another seven years, during which one more studio album, ''[[Reinventing the Steel]]'' (2000), was recorded. Pantera went on hiatus in 2001, but lingering disputes led to the band breaking up in 2003. The Abbott brothers went on to form [[Damageplan]] while Anselmo continued to work on several side projects, including [[Down (band)|Down]], which Brown joined as well.

On December 8, 2004, Dimebag Darrell was [[Columbus nightclub shooting|shot and killed]] on stage by a mentally unstable fan during a Damageplan concert in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Vinnie Paul went on to form [[Hellyeah]] after his brother's death and died of heart failure in 2018,<ref name="vinnie paul death">{{cite magazine|title=Vinnie Paul, Legendary Drummer for Pantera & Damageplan, Dead at 54|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/obituary/8462386/vinnie-paul-dead-pantera-damageplan-hellyeah|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]]|date=June 22, 2018|access-date=June 22, 2018}}</ref> leaving Brown and Anselmo as the only surviving members of the band's best-known lineup.

==History==
===1981–1986: Formation and early glam years===
[[File:Panteraoldlogo.png|thumb|right|Pantera's second logo, used during their [[glam metal]] era in the 1980s]]
The band was originally named Gemini, then Eternity, before finally settling on Pantera after it was recommended to Vinnie while he was in [[drumline]] by his friend Don Sowers in high school.<ref name=":1" /> The name was inspired by the car [[De Tomaso Pantera]].<ref name=":1">{{Citation|title=Pantera / Hellyeah's Vinnie Paul Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?'|date=November 30, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2K-AS-2iAk&t=60|access-date=September 3, 2025|work=YouTube}}</ref> The band consisted of [[Vinnie Paul|Vinnie Paul Abbott]] on drums, [[Dimebag Darrell|Darrell Abbott]] on lead guitar, and [[Terry Glaze]] on rhythm guitar; the lineup was completed with two more members, lead vocalist Donny Hart and bassist Tommy D. Bradford. In 1982, Hart left the band and Glaze became the group's lead vocalist. Later, Glaze stopped playing rhythm guitar, leaving Darrell as the sole guitarist, doing both lead and rhythm duties. Later that year, Bradford also departed and was replaced by [[Rex Brown]] (then known as Rex Rocker) on bass.

Pantera became an underground favorite, though its regional tours in this era never took them beyond [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Louisiana]]. The band began supporting fellow [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]/[[glam metal]] acts such as [[Stryper]], [[Dokken]], and [[Quiet Riot]]. Pantera released their first studio album, ''[[Metal Magic]]'', in 1983. ''Metal Magic'' was released on the band's record label of the same name and produced by the Abbott brothers' father, [[Jerry Abbott]], at Pantego Studios.<ref name="MusicMight">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/texas/arlington/pantera |title=Pantera biography |work=[[MusicMight]] |access-date=December 29, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330173817/http://musicmight.com/artist/united%2Bstates/texas/arlington/pantera |archive-date=March 30, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1984, Pantera released their second studio album, ''[[Projects in the Jungle]]''. Although still very much a glam metal album, the band members crafted songs that had less overbearing melodic influences than songs from the previous album.<ref name="upr">{{cite web|last1=Hugar|first1=John|title=Pantera's Early Glam Days Will Have You Rethinking Everything You Knew About Metal|url=http://uproxx.com/music/pantera-glam-metal-dimebag-darrell-phil-anselmo/|website=Uproxx|access-date=January 24, 2017|date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> Another change was Terry Glaze's name, as he was henceforth credited as "Terrence Lee". In addition, a music video for the album's lead track, "All Over Tonight", was eventually created. ''Projects in the Jungle'' was also released on the band's independent Metal Magic Records label and produced by Jerry Abbott.

In 1985, Pantera released their third studio album, titled ''[[I Am the Night (album)|I Am the Night]]''. As with ''Projects in the Jungle'', this album saw Pantera's sound becoming heavier (though still rooted in glam metal),<ref name="upr" /> and the heavy metal press took more notice of the band. Because of poor distribution, ''I Am the Night'' turned out to be a costly album to many fans. Around 25,000 copies of the album were sold. Pantera's second music video was produced for the track "Hot and Heavy". By 1986, Glaze's glam approach did not fit the band's developing style, and he and the other members parted ways.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Sarah|title=Bowie rocker: "I want to be doing this forever"|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/02042010/laurnew113258_32561.php|access-date=January 24, 2017|work=Gazette.net|publisher=Post Community Media LLC|date=February 4, 2010|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044127/http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/02042010/laurnew113258_32561.php|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===1986–1989: Anselmo's introduction and ''Power Metal''===
Pantera began a search for Glaze's replacement and initially auditioned Matt L'Amour, a [[David Coverdale]] lookalike. He sang a number of shows with the band in Los Angeles during the winter of 1986, but it became somewhat apparent that L'Amour could not hit the high notes Glaze was capable of. Together with his lack of stage presence, this meant that Pantera could only play cover songs, leading to L'Amour's departure.<ref>Daniels, Neil; ''Reinventing Metal: The True Story of Pantera and the Tragically Short Life of Dimebag Darrell'' pp. 42–43 {{ISBN|9781480341036}}</ref> Pantera next auditioned [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] native Rick Mythiasin, later to sing for [[Steel Prophet]] and [[Agent Steel]]; however, cultural and image differences – Mythiasin failed to adapt to the [[Southern United States|Southern]] culture of the other members – meant his tenure was even shorter than that of L'Amour.<ref>Daniels; ''Reinventing Metal''; pp. 44–45</ref> A former schoolmate of the Abbott brothers, David Peacock of the band Forced Entry (who had supported [[Warlock (band)|Warlock]]),<ref>Daniels, ''Reinventing Metal'', pp. 46–47</ref> joined the band as lead vocalist in the spring of 1986, but despite Pantera doing most of the work for their fourth album during the summer with Peacock, Rex and the Abbotts found Peacock's voice to be unsuited to the musical direction Pantera wished for.<ref>Daniels; ''Reinventing Metal'', p. 48</ref> By the end of the year, Pantera even revisited original frontman Donny Hart, but Hart himself knew that he was not the right frontman Pantera were seeking and Jerry Abbott was going to fire him.

Also in 1986, [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] native and then-eighteen year old [[Phil Anselmo]] had heard Pantera were looking for a singer.<ref>Daniels; ''Reinventing Metal'', p. 54</ref> At the end of the year, they invited him to audition, and the eighteen-year old Anselmo was hired as the new vocalist on the spot.<ref name="jwlw">{{cite web|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|title=28 Years Ago: Pantera Release 'Power Metal'|url=http://loudwire.com/pantera-power-metal-album-anniversary/|website=Loudwire|access-date=January 24, 2017|date=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Anselmo had previously been the vocalist for the bands Samhain<ref name="MusicMight" /> (not to be confused with [[Glenn Danzig]]'s [[Samhain (band)|band of the same name]]) and Razor White.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/phil_anselmo-far_beyond_driven|title=Phil Anselmo Far Beyond Driven|last=Carman|first=Keith|date=November 29, 2010|work=Exclaim!|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref> Upon playing with Pantera, Anselmo immediately clicked with the other three members.<ref name="jwlw" /> The years 1986 and 1987 saw the release of several landmark [[thrash metal]] albums that would prove influential to Pantera's developing musical style. Among the most prominent of these were [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', [[Slayer]]'s ''[[Reign in Blood]]'', [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]'s ''[[Among the Living]],'' and [[Megadeth]]'s ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?]]''.<ref name="btm">{{cite video |people=[[VH1]] |date=2006 |title=[[Behind the Music]] |medium=TV series}}</ref> When Anselmo joined the band, he would bring his mixtapes with him and play bands such as [[Exhorder]], [[Slayer]], and [[Rigor Mortis (band)|Rigor Mortis]] to the other band members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ4hUHqUXc4&list=PL_HIIWP6T_gt-eTMDCJcly1dWORIH8aLX| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/XJ4hUHqUXc4| archive-date=2021-10-30|title=ニューオリンズ ヘヴィロック狂想曲（１）| date=April 30, 2015|access-date=July 20, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In 1988, with Anselmo as the new vocalist, Pantera released their fourth studio album, titled ''[[Power Metal (album)|Power Metal]]''.<ref name="upr" /> ''Power Metal'', like Pantera's previous three albums, was released by Metal Magic Records, but showcased a change in their sound.<ref name="jwlw" /> By far the band's heaviest album at this point, ''Power Metal'' had little resemblance to the [[power metal]] subgenre, but was a mix of 1980s glam metal and thrash metal, sometimes blending both styles in a single song.<ref name="jwlw"/> Complementing the band's new sonic approach were Anselmo's harder-edged vocals compared to those of Terry Glaze.<ref name="jwlw" /> After the release of ''Power Metal'', the band members decided to seriously reconsider their glam metal image and sound.<ref name="jwlw" /> Referring to the band's spandex appearance, Vinnie Paul remarked at a band meeting that "These magic clothes don't play music; we do. Let's just go out there and be comfortable, jeans, t-shirt, whatever, and see where it goes."<ref name="btm" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Metal Retrospective: Pantera|url=https://ametalstateofmind.com/2011/11/08/metal-retrospective-pantera/2/|website=A Metal State of Mind|access-date=January 24, 2017|date=November 8, 2011|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202123220/https://ametalstateofmind.com/2011/11/08/metal-retrospective-pantera/2/|archive-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref> The band members would later no longer acknowledge their independent releases, including ''Power Metal'', as they sculpted a new, heavier image to accompany their later [[groove metal]] sound. Their four independent albums are not listed on the band's official website and have become hard-to-find collector's items.

Shortly after ''Power Metal'' was released, [[Megadeth]] needed a guitarist and asked [[Dimebag Darrell|Diamond Darrell]] to join the band. Darrell insisted that his brother, bandmate Vinnie Paul, be included. However, Megadeth had already hired [[Nick Menza]] as their new drummer so Darrell declined the offer, and [[Dave Mustaine]] instead decided on [[Marty Friedman]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Dave Mustaine Recalls Almost Hiring Dimebag & Vinnie Paul For Megadeth in 1988 |url=https://metalinjection.net/latest-news/dave-mustaine-recalls-almost-hiring-dimebag-vinnie-paul-for-megadeth-in-1988 |website=Metal Injection|date=March 2, 2019 }}</ref>

===1989–1991: ''Cowboys from Hell'' and mainstream breakthrough===
The Abbott brothers refocused their attention on Pantera, and in 1989 they were given their first shot at commercial success. That year was also when the band formed their relationship with Walter O'Brien at Concrete Management (the management arm of [[Concrete Marketing]]), who remained their manager until they disbanded in 2003.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/article/walter_o039brien_strength_beyond_strength |title=Walter O'Brien: Strength Beyond Strength |magazine=Guitar World |date=April 13, 2010 |access-date=November 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114002632/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/walter_o039brien_strength_beyond_strength |archive-date=November 14, 2010 }}</ref>

Ross was so impressed by the band's performance that he called his boss that night, suggesting that the band should be signed to the label. Atco Records accepted, and at the conclusion of 1989, the band recorded its major label debut at Pantego Studios and hired [[Terry Date]] to produce it, in large part because of his work with [[Soundgarden]], [[Metal Church]], and [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], the latter of whose latest album at the time ''[[The Years of Decay]]'' was one of the sources of inspiration behind Pantera's transition away from glam/traditional heavy metal to [[thrash metal|thrash]]/[[groove metal]], as well as Diamond Darrell's guitar tone on the album.<ref name="Overkill">The following sources refer to Overkill as one of the sources of inspiration to Pantera's music:

[[File:Pantera.png|thumb|The band's later logo, used on all Pantera releases since ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'' (1990)]]
Looking for their first big breakthrough, Pantera released their fifth studio album, titled ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'', on July 24, 1990, which was produced by Pantera and Date. Pantera showed a more extreme style on this outing, leaving behind its glam metal influences in favor of mid-tempo thrash metal dubbed "power groove" (groove metal) by the band. Although Anselmo still used some [[Rob Halford]]-influenced vocals, he also adopted a more abrasive delivery. Darrell's more complex [[guitar solo]]s and [[riff]]s, along with his brother's faster-paced drum-work were evidence of the band's extreme transformation. The album marked a critical juncture in the band's history. Many fans, and the band itself, have referred to ''Cowboys from Hell'' as Pantera's "official" debut.<ref name="bio"/> ''Cowboys from Hell'' also notably included the power ballad "[[Cemetery Gates (Pantera song)|Cemetery Gates]]", which ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' praised as the best Pantera song and "one of the greatest epic ballads in metal history".<ref>{{cite web|last=Lawson|first=Dom|date=February 4, 2019|title=The 50 best Pantera songs ever|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-50-greatest-pantera-songs-ever/5|access-date=June 2, 2021|website=[[Metal Hammer]]|page=5}}</ref>

To promote the album, Pantera began the ''Cowboys from Hell'' tour by opening for thrash acts [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and [[Suicidal Tendencies]]. In 1991, Halford performed with the band onstage, which led Pantera (along with [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]]) to open for [[Judas Priest]] on its first show in Europe. In addition, Halford collaborated with Pantera on the song "Light Comes Out of Black", which was featured on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pantera.com/2014/10/17/rob-halford-looks-back-on-doing-light-comes-out-of-black-with-pantera/|work=Pantera Official Website|access-date=July 12, 2022|title=Rob Halford looks back on doing "Light Comes Out of Black" with Pantera – Pantera |date=October 17, 2014 }}</ref> Pantera also opened for other bands like [[Sepultura]], [[Fates Warning]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]], [[Mind Over Four]], and [[Morbid Angel]], and co-headlined a North American tour with [[Wrathchild America]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metallipromo.com/pantera.html |title=Pantera Tour Dates |publisher=Metallipromo.com |access-date=January 11, 2017}}</ref> The band eventually landed a billing for "[[Monsters of Rock#Russia|Monsters in Moscow]]" with [[AC/DC]] and [[Metallica]] in September 1991, where they played to a crowd of over 500,000 in attendance to celebrate the new freedom of performing Western music in the Soviet Union shortly before its [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|downfall]] three months later. The band was often found at the Dallas club "the Basement", where the band shot the videos for "Cowboys from Hell" and "[[Psycho Holiday]]". Pantera's 2006 home video compilation ''[[3 Vulgar Videos from Hell]]'' features performances of "Primal Concrete Sledge", "Cowboys from Hell", "Domination", and "Psycho Holiday" from the show in Moscow.

Pantera's unique "groove" style came to fruition with their sixth studio album, titled ''[[Vulgar Display of Power]]'', recorded in 1991 and released on February 25, 1992. On this album, the power metal falsetto vocals were replaced with a hardcore-influenced shouted delivery and heavier guitar sound, which firmly cemented the band's popularity among mainstream and underground fans alike. Two other singles from the album became two of Pantera's most notable ballads: "[[This Love (Pantera song)|This Love]]", a haunting piece about lust and abuse, and "[[Hollow (Pantera song)|Hollow]]", somewhat reminiscent of "Cemetery Gates" from the previous album. The band would play the song "Domination" (from ''Cowboys from Hell'') leading into the ending of "Hollow" (what is roughly the last 2:30 of the album version), forming a medley referred to as "Dom/Hollow", as can be heard on the band's 1997 live album ''[[Official Live: 101 Proof]]''. Singles from ''Vulgar Display of Power'' also received significant airplay on radio as did the companion music videos on [[MTV]]. "[[Walk (Pantera song)|Walk]]" became one of the band's more popular songs, and it appeared on the [[UK Singles Chart]], peaking at the No.&nbsp;35 position. The album itself entered the American charts at No.&nbsp;44.<ref name="200chart"/> Pantera went on tour again, visiting Japan for the first time in July 1992 and later performing at the "[[Monsters of Rock#1992 2|Monsters of Rock]]" festival co-headlined by [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Black Sabbath]] in Italy. It was around this time that Darrell Abbott dropped the nickname "Diamond Darrell" and assumed "[[Dimebag Darrell]]", and [[Rex Brown]] dropped the pseudonym "Rex Rocker".

Pantera released their seventh studio album, titled ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'', on March 22, 1994, which debuted at No. 1 in both United States<ref name="200chart"/> and Australian album charts. The album's first single, "[[I'm Broken]]", earned the band's first [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Grammy nomination for "Best Metal Performance"]] in [[Grammy Awards of 1995|1995]]. "[[Planet Caravan]]", a Black Sabbath cover which appeared on ''Far Beyond Driven'', was the band's first charting single in the U.S. as it peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Chart]]. The album saw Pantera continue its groove metal approach, while taking an even more extreme direction with its musical style. The album's original artwork (a drill bit impaling an anus) was banned, so it was re-released with the familiar skull impaled with a drill bit. A limited edition was released with a slip-cover case. Also, a boxed set called ''Driven Down Under Tour '94 Souvenir Collection'' was released in Australia and New Zealand to coincide with the tours there. It featured ''Far Beyond Driven'' (with its original banned artwork) with a bonus thirteenth track, "The Badge" (a [[Poison Idea]] cover), the five-track ''Alive and Hostile'' EP, and the Japanese collector's edition ''[[Walk (Pantera EPs)|Walk]]'' EP, all presented in a special cardboard box with an eight-page color biography.

Pantera began touring again, starting in South America, along with being accepted into another "[[Monsters of Rock#1994|Monsters of Rock]]" billing. In late June, Anselmo was charged with assault for attacking a security guard after he prevented fans from getting on stage. Anselmo was released on a $5,000 bail the next day.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/BN/lib00142,0EAF97EAAE9DA721.html | title=Darien Lake Concert Frays Nerves Again Band's Singer Charged With Assault |newspaper=[[Buffalo News]] | date=June 29, 1994 | access-date = April 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AD/lib00241,0EB47798D28863CB.html | title=N.O. native, Pantera singer, arrested in guard's assault |newspaper=[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|The Advocate]] | date=October 26, 1994 | access-date = April 6, 2008}}</ref> The trial was delayed three times.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/BN/lib00142,0EAF9825A7209AA9.html | title=Rock Singer Assault Case Adjourned Third Time |newspaper=[[Buffalo News]] | date=October 26, 1994 | access-date = April 6, 2008}}</ref> In May 1995, he apologized in court and pleaded guilty to attempted assault and was ordered to undergo 100 hours of [[community service]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/SLTB/lib00826,1010DE6F85D7B491.html | title=The Scuttlebutt |newspaper=[[Salt Lake Tribune]] | date=May 12, 1995 | access-date = April 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/GF/lib00128,0EB6EA90E5CEB00C.html | title=Pantera Singer Changes his Tune |publisher=[[Grand Forks Herald]] | date=April 21, 1995 | access-date = April 6, 2008}}</ref> Pantera continued their tour of the United Kingdom in 1994 and eventually ended it in North America where the band was supported by [[Sepultura]] and [[Prong (band)|Prong]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://pantera.com/tourhistory/ | title=Tour Dates History – Pantera }}</ref>

===1995–1999: Band tensions and ''The Great Southern Trendkill''===
According to the Abbott brothers, Anselmo began behaving strangely and distanced himself from the band when they returned to the road in 1995. The rest of the band members first thought that fame had gotten to Anselmo, but Anselmo cited back pain from years of intense performances as the reason for his erratic behavior. Anselmo attempted to alleviate his pain through alcohol, but this, as he admitted, was affecting his performances and "putting some worry into the band."<ref name="btm" /> Doctors predicted that with surgery, Anselmo's back problem could be corrected, but with a long recovery time. Unwilling to spend so long away from the band, Anselmo refused, and began using [[heroin]] as a painkiller.

After stating at a [[Montreal]] concert that "rap music advocates the killing of white people", Anselmo denied accusations of racism and issued an apology,<ref>{{cite web | last =Shanafelt | first =Steve | title =You'll like them when they're angry | work =Mountain Xpress | date =July 9, 2003 | url =http://mountainx.com/ae/2003/0709superjoint.php | access-date = June 25, 2007}}</ref> stating that he was drunk and that his remarks were a mistake.<ref name="MusicMight" /> In 1995, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Down (band)|Down]], one of Anselmo's many side projects, released their debut album, ''[[NOLA (album)|NOLA]]'', but shortly afterwards the group members returned to their respective bands, leaving Down inactive for several years.

Pantera's eighth studio album, ''[[The Great Southern Trendkill]]'', was released on May 7, 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pantera.com/thegreatsoutherntrendkill/|title=The Great Southern Trendkill 1996 – Pantera|website=pantera.com|access-date=January 25, 2018}}</ref> and is often considered their "overlooked" album.<ref name="donkaye" /> Anselmo recorded the vocals for this release in [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman [[Trent Reznor]]'s studio in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] while the rest of the band recorded in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. In comparison to the band's previous efforts, there was emphasis on vocal [[overdub]]bing in a somewhat "demonic"{{clarify|date=January 2025}} fashion. Drug abuse is a recurring theme in ''The Great Southern Trendkill'', as exemplified by tracks such as "[[Suicide Note (song)|Suicide Note Pt. I/Pt. II]]", "10's", and "Living Through Me (Hell's Wrath)". "[[Drag the Waters]]" was the album's only [[music video]]. The album's other single, "[[Floods (Pantera song)|Floods]]", achieved acclaim largely because of Darrell's complex [[guitar solo]], which ranked No.&nbsp;15 on ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine's list of the "100 Greatest Guitar Solos" of all time.<ref>{{cite web | title = 100 Greatest Guitar Solos (11–20) | work = Guitar World | url = http://guitar.about.com/library/bl100greatesta.htm | access-date = March 5, 2008 | archive-date = July 7, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707074954/http://guitar.about.com/library/bl100greatesta.htm | url-status = dead }}</ref>

On July 13, 1996, during their tour with [[Eyehategod]] and [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2016/08/04/that-tour-was-awesome-pantera-white-zombie-eyehategod-1996/|title=That Tour Was Awesome: Pantera/White Zombie/Eyehategod (1996)|date=August 4, 2016}}</ref> Anselmo overdosed on heroin an hour after a Texas homecoming gig.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/ST/lib00155,0EAF9099EDD696F6.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714185554/http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/ST/lib00155,0EAF9099EDD696F6.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=July 14, 2012 | title=Pantera singer says he overdosed on heroin |newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] | date=July 18, 1996 | access-date = April 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-792332.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011163054/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-792332.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=October 11, 2013 | title=The Heroin Experience; The Drug Has Smacked Into More Than One Generation of Musicians |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=August 11, 1996 | access-date = April 6, 2008}}</ref> After his heart stopped beating for almost five minutes, Anselmo was revived with an adrenaline shot.

Anselmo said that he relapsed twice after this and was overcome with guilt.<ref name="btm" />

Pantera released their first live album, ''[[Official Live: 101 Proof]]'', on July 29, 1997, which included fourteen live tracks and two new studio recordings: "[[Official Live: 101 Proof|Where You Come From]]" and "I Can't Hide". Two weeks before the live album's release, Pantera received its first [[RIAA certification|platinum album]], for ''Cowboys from Hell''. Just four months later, both ''Vulgar Display of Power'' and ''Far Beyond Driven'' were awarded platinum as well.<ref name="ussales">{{cite web | url = https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH | title = RIAA US Sales Search | website = [[Recording Industry Association of America]] | access-date = November 3, 2007}}</ref> The band also received their second and third "[[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]]" Grammy nominations for ''The Great Southern Trendkill''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "[[Suicide Note Pt.

Also in 1997, Pantera played on the mainstage of [[Ozzfest]] alongside [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Type O Negative]], [[Fear Factory]], [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], and [[Powerman 5000]]. Additionally, the band played on the 1998 UK Ozzfest tour alongside Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, [[Foo Fighters]], [[Slayer]], [[Soulfly]], Fear Factory, and [[Therapy?]], as well as touring with [[Clutch (band)|Clutch]] and [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Joe|last=Ehrbar|title=Dose Of Neurosis Opening For Pantera On Monday, The Bay Area's Neurosis Will Be Cramming Everything They've Got Into A Half-Hour Of Pile-Driving Hardcore Rock|publisher=Spokesman.com|date=January 31, 1997|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/jan/31/dose-of-neurosis-opening-for-pantera-on-monday/|access-date=January 23, 2012}}</ref>

===1999–2003: Side projects, ''Reinventing the Steel'', and breakup===
Around this time, Anselmo ventured into more side projects, such as playing guitars on [[Necrophagia]]'s 1999 release ''[[Holocausto de la Morte]]'', where he went as the alias "Anton Crowley", which combines the names of [[Church of Satan]] founder [[Anton LaVey]] and occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]. He also temporarily joined the [[black metal]] supergroup Eibon and contributed vocals to that band's only two songs. Another one of Anselmo's "Anton Crowley" projects was black metal band [[Viking Crown]]. The Abbott brothers and Rex Brown began their own [[country rock|country metal]] crossover project, [[Rebel Meets Rebel]] with [[David Allan Coe]], around the same time.

The band wrote a song for the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Dallas Stars]] during the team's [[1998–99 NHL season|1999]] [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Championship run]], "Puck Off", which in recent years has been used as the Stars' goal song at [[American Airlines Center]]. Throughout the season, members of the team befriended members of Pantera. During a Stanley Cup party hosted by Vinnie Paul, the [[Stanley Cup]] was damaged when [[Guy Carbonneau]] attempted to throw the cup from the balcony of Vinnie Paul's house into his pool. The Cup landed short on the concrete deck and had to be repaired by NHL commissioned silversmiths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hookedonhockeymagazine.com/dallas-stars-and-the-mystery-dent-in-the-stanley-cup/|title=The Dallas Stars and the Mystery Dent in the Stanley Cup|date=December 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2K-AS-2iAk|title=Vinnie Paul - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|date=November 30, 2016 |via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Later on in 1999, Pantera contributed the [[Ted Nugent]] cover "[[Cat Scratch Fever]]" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Detroit Rock City (film)|Detroit Rock City]]''. It became the band's second appearance on the Mainstream Rock Chart, peaking at the No.&nbsp;40 position.

Pantera returned to the recording studio with Anselmo in 1999, releasing their ninth (considered fifth by the band itself) and final studio album, ''[[Reinventing the Steel]]'', on March 21, 2000. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref name="200chart"/> and included two singles; "[[Revolution Is My Name]]" and "[[Goddamn Electric]]", the latter of which featured a [[Kerry King]] outro solo recorded backstage in one take during [[Ozzfest]] in Dallas. "Revolution Is My Name" became the band's fourth nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] in the [[Grammy Awards of 2001|2001 Grammys]], and it peaked at No.&nbsp;28 on the Mainstream Rock Chart in the U.S.. In 2000, Pantera played on the mainstage of [[Ozzfest]] alongside [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Godsmack]], [[Static-X]], [[Methods of Mayhem]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[P.O.D.]], [[Black Label Society]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], and [[Apartment 26]]. In November, the band canceled their planned tour after Anselmo broke his ribs after falling during his eighth annual [[House of Shock]] event.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pantera/articles/story/5923151/pantera_cancel_tour | title=Pantera Cancel Tour |magazine=Rolling Stone | date=November 1, 2000 | access-date = April 6, 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In 2001, the band once again returned to touring, playing with fellow metal bands [[Morbid Angel]], [[Skrape]], Slayer, and Static-X as part of the Extreme Steel Tour of North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1444695/pantera-slayer-deliver-lesson-in-brutality-at-extreme-steel-kickoff/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131201044/http://www.mtv.com/news/1444695/pantera-slayer-deliver-lesson-in-brutality-at-extreme-steel-kickoff/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 31, 2018|title=Pantera, Slayer Deliver Lesson In Brutality At Extreme Steel Kickoff|website=Mtv.com|access-date=June 23, 2018}}</ref> They were also guest musicians on the show ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' in the episode "[[Pre-Hibernation Week]]", performing the song "Death Rattle" from ''Reinventing the Steel'' (renamed as "Pre-Hibernation" on the 2001 soundtrack ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants: Original Theme Highlights]]''). Following the Extreme Steel tour, a planned tour of Europe was cut short as a result of the [[September 11 attacks]], which left the band stranded in [[Dublin]], Ireland for six days as a result of all flights being canceled. Pantera played their last show in Yokohama, Japan at the "Beast Feast" festival on August 28, 2001. This would be the last time the members of Pantera performed together. Back home, the band planned to release its fourth home video in the summer of 2002 and record another studio album later that year, but neither came about.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451613/20011226/pantera.jhtml?headlines=true | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020210000533/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451613/20011226/pantera.jhtml?headlines=true | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2002 | title=Pantera Members Rip It Up With Rebellious Side Projects|publisher=MTV | date=December 21, 2001 | first=Jon | last=Wiederhorn | access-date = November 4, 2006}}</ref>

Anselmo again engaged in numerous side projects. In March 2002, [[Down (band)|Down]] released its second studio album, ''[[Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow]]'', which featured Rex Brown on bass following [[Todd Strange]]'s departure in 1999. Brown remained Down's full-time bassist until 2011, having appeared on their [[Down III: Over the Under|subsequent release in 2007]]. Also, in May of that year, Anselmo's [[Superjoint Ritual]] released its debut album, ''[[Use Once and Destroy]]''. Vinnie Paul claimed that Anselmo told him that he would take a year off following the events of September 11, 2001, but Anselmo's touring and recording output for both [[Superjoint Ritual]] and [[Down (band)|Down]] contradicted this.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} Nonetheless, Anselmo recalled that a "great distancing" occurred among the band in this period.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Blabbermouth |date=2004-12-01 |title=PHILIP ANSELMO: 'DIMEBAG DARRELL Deserves To Be Beaten Severely' |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/philip-anselmo-dimebag-darrell-deserves-to-be-beaten-severely/ |access-date=2022-11-27 |website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET |language=en}}</ref> The Abbott brothers were frustrated, and held out for an indefinite period of time, assuming that Anselmo would return. However, according to Anselmo, taking a break from Pantera was a "mutual thing" between each of the band members.<ref name="interview">{{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=12289 | title = Phil Anselmo speaks on the future of Pantera | date=May 27, 2003 | work = [[Blabbermouth.net]] | access-date = October 17, 2005}}</ref>

The Abbott brothers officially disbanded Pantera in November 2003,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dimebag-darrell-pantera-is-officially-over/|title = DIMEBAG DARRELL: 'PANTERA is Officially Over'|date = November 24, 2003}}</ref> also the year when their [[The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits!|best-of compilation album]] was released, when the two concluded that Anselmo had abandoned them and would not return. The dissolution of the band was not amicable and subsequently a war of words was waged between the former bandmates via the press. In an [[MTV]] [[Headbangers Ball|Headbanger's Ball]] interview in January 2004, Vinnie Paul explained that they had not spoken to Anselmo in two years, and was cynical in response to Anselmo wishing the Abbott brothers success, citing Anselmo's "sedated state."<ref>{{Citation |title=Damageplan Discuss The Breakup of Pantera - Interview On Headbangers Ball (01-24-04) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgut7HMeerw |language=en |access-date=2022-11-27}}</ref> Meanwhile, Dimebag implied in interviews that Anselmo had returned to heroin use, something which Anselmo said was unsubstantiated as he was over 3 years sober.<ref name=":0" /> Anselmo's comment in a 2004 issue of ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine, saying that Dimebag would "attack him" verbally and "deserves to be beaten severely", typified Pantera's internal conflicts; Anselmo insisted that this comment was [[tongue-in-cheek]], and he was upset that the quote ended up on the cover of the magazine.<ref name="btm" /> This explanation was soon dismissed by Vinnie Paul, who said shortly after the 2004 murder of his brother that he had personally listened to the audio files of the interview and that Anselmo had not been misquoted or misrepresented, but said the exact words which appeared in the article.<ref name="btm" /> <blockquote>"I think, more or less, it lies between Dimebag and I. There was never a point when he could not get drunk. Which was pretty much every day. And now I'm hearing it's worse than ever [...] The anger and the hatred and the drunken nights of just screaming in my face, with me sitting there taking it and holding both of my hands just to not hit the guy… I grew weary of that. I was sick of being his whipping post, y'know, and I just politely, or unpolitely, excused myself." - Anselmo, December 2004<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>Caught up in the torrent was Rex Brown, who later said "It was a bunch of he said, she said nonsense that was going on, and I wasn't going to get in the middle of it."<ref name="btm" /> In a 2015 interview, he'd add, "Vinnie drew this imaginary line in the sand [...] He said, ‘You’re either on our side or not.’ I didn't want to take sides. [...] The whole thing was ridiculous, but I never talked about it.".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/magazine/rex-brown-recalls-making-panteras-cowboys-hell-vulgar|title=Rex Brown Recalls the Making of Pantera's 'Cowboys from Hell,' 'Vulgar Display of Power' and More|first1=Jon|last1=Wiederhorn|date=July 24, 2015|website=guitarworld}}</ref>

===2003–2004: Damageplan and the murder of Dimebag Darrell===
{{Further|Columbus nightclub shooting}}
[[File:Dimebag 001.jpg|thumb|A fan outside the Alrosa Villa pays tribute to Dimebag Darrell, the main target of Nathan Gale's massacre]]
After Pantera's disbandment, Darrell and Vinnie formed a new band, [[Damageplan]], with vocalist [[Patrick Lachman|Pat Lachman]] and bassist [[Bob Kakaha|Bob Zilla]]. Damageplan released their first and only studio album, ''[[New Found Power]]'', on February 10, 2004. The album was a commercial success; over 44,000 copies were sold in its first week alone and within a year over 100,000 copies were sold, while the album's singles "Save Me" and "Pride" had appeared on the Mainstream Rock Chart. However, some fans felt that Damageplan's material did not measure up to that of Pantera.<ref name="btm" />

On December 8, 2004, less than a minute into the first song of a Damageplan show at the Alrosa Villa in [[Columbus, Ohio]], a 25-year-old man named Nathan Gale walked onto the stage with a gun, shooting and killing [[Dimebag Darrell|Darrell]]. Gale also killed fan Nathan Bray, 23, club employee Erin Halk, 29, and Pantera security official Jeff "Mayhem" Thompson, 40, and injured longtime Pantera and Damageplan drum technician John "Kat" Brooks and Damageplan tour manager Chris Paluska before being shot dead by Columbus police officer James Niggemeyer.<ref name="mtvdamageplan">{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494653/20041209/damageplan.jhtml?headlines=true | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041213090933/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494653/20041209/damageplan.jhtml?headlines=true | url-status = dead | archive-date = December 13, 2004 | title = Dimebag Darrell, Four Others Killed In Ohio Concert Shooting | work = [[MTV]] | access-date = December 29, 2005}}</ref>

No motive has been given as to why Gale killed Dimebag Darrell and the other victims, but early theories, which were dismissed by police, suggested that Gale, who was reported to have been diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], was apparently upset over Pantera's breakup. In a number of interviews, some of Gale's friends suggested that he claimed that he had written songs that were stolen by Pantera.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dimebag Darrell killing 'not motivated by Pantera split' |date=October 21, 2005|url=https://www.nme.com/news/pantera/21316|publisher=NME|access-date=March 29, 2014}}</ref>

A week after the shooting, it was reported that album sales of both Damageplan and Pantera albums jumped sharply.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blabbermouth|date=2004-12-15|title=DAMAGEPLAN, PANTERA Album Sales Jump Sharply Following Guitarist's Death|url=https://search.blabbermouth.net/news/damageplan-pantera-album-sales-jump-sharply-following-guitarist-s-death/|access-date=2022-02-12|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|archive-date=February 12, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220212172557/https://search.blabbermouth.net/news/damageplan-pantera-album-sales-jump-sharply-following-guitarist-s-death/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===2004–2022: After Damageplan, personal issues, and Vinnie Paul's death===
When Anselmo called in the aftermath of the murders, Rita Haney, Darrell's girlfriend, told him she would "blow Anselmo's head off" if he attended Darrell's funeral.<ref name="btm" /> He was buried with [[Eddie Van Halen]]'s black and yellow-striped Charvel electric guitar (sometimes referred to as "Bumblebee"), which was pictured with Van Halen on the inner sleeve and back cover of the album ''[[Van Halen II]]''. Dimebag had asked for one of these guitars in 2004, shortly before his death. Eddie Van Halen originally agreed to make Darrell a copy of the guitar, but upon hearing of Abbott's death, offered to place the actual guitar in his casket. Dimebag was buried in a [[Kiss Kasket]] (a casket inspired by the band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]). Kiss co-founder [[Gene Simmons]] said, "There were a limited number made and I sent mine to the family of 'Dimebag' Darrell. He requested in his will to be buried in a Kiss Kasket, as he sort of learned his rock 'n' roll roots by listening to us for some strange reason." Not long after Darrell's murder, Anselmo received a heated message from Vinnie, which (according to Anselmo) "went along the lines that my (Anselmo's) day was coming." Anselmo's rebuttal was that everybody's day is coming and that if his day should come before Vinnie's, it would not change anything except for Vinnie having to go through "losing another brother".

Public comments made by Anselmo following the shooting suggested that he had considered reuniting with the band prior to Darrell's death.<ref name="anselmo">{{cite web | url = http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=11734 | title = Philip H Anselmo; On Behalf of Darrell Lance Abbott-Pt.

On May 11, 2006, the [[VH1]] ''[[Behind the Music]]'' episode on Pantera premiered. While focusing heavily on Darrell's murder and burial, the episode also detailed the band's glam metal beginnings, the band's rise in popularity after the change in musical direction, and the conflicts between Anselmo and the Abbott brothers in the band's later years that would tear them apart. When asked by Crave Music in 2006 if there was any chance of reconciling with Phil Anselmo, Vinnie Paul answered "Absolutely not. That's it."<ref name="reconciliation">{{cite interview | first=Vinnie | last=Paul | subject-link=Vinnie Paul | interviewer=Joseph Rose | publisher=CraveOnline | title=CraveOnline Talks To Vinnie Paul | date=July 26, 2006 }}</ref> The former Pantera drummer subsequently began work on [[Hellyeah]], a collaboration between him and members from [[Mudvayne]] and [[Nothingface (band)|Nothingface]].

In interviews in 2009 and 2010, both Rita Haney and Phil Anselmo stated that, after a meeting at [[Download Festival|Download]] 2009, they had patched up their differences and are once again on speaking terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dimebag-s-girlfriend-says-she-hopes-vinnie-paul-sees-the-light-and-forgives-philip-anselmo/|title=DIMEBAG's Girlfriend Says She Hopes VINNIE PAUL 'Sees The Light' And Forgives PHILIP ANSELMO|date=August 22, 2011|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=June 23, 2018}}</ref> On March 30, 2010, Pantera released a greatest-hits compilation album, titled ''1990–2000: A Decade of Domination''.

During a 2012 appearance on ''[[That Metal Show]]'', when asked about the possibility of a Pantera reunion, Vinnie Paul said that it would be possible if Dimebag Darrell were still alive. Despite being proud of his Pantera years, however, he indicated that there were no plans for a reunion, adding that "some stones are better left unturned."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/that-metal-show-recap-vinnie-paul-says-some-stones-are-better-left-unturned-regarding-pantera-reunion/ |title='That Metal Show' Recap: Vinnie Paul Says 'Some Stones Are Better Left Unturned' Regarding Pantera Reunion |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=May 20, 2012 |access-date=March 29, 2014}}</ref> In 2013, Brown published his autobiography titled ''Official Truth: 101 Proof'', which chronicled his time in Pantera.

Comments about a potential one-off reunion concert continued to resurface periodically, with [[Zakk Wylde]] often being suggested as the stand-in replacement for Darrell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/korns-munky-luzier-would-love-to-see-pantera-reunion-with-zakk-wylde-on-guitar/|title=Korn's Munky, Luzier 'Would Love' To See Pantera 'Reunion' With Zakk Wylde On Guitar |website=Blabbermouth.net|date=November 21, 2014|access-date=March 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/zakk-wylde-on-hypothetical-pantera-reunion-theres-no-replacing-dimebag/|title=Zakk Wylde On Hypothetical Pantera Reunion: 'There's No Replacing' Dimebag |website=Blabbermouth.net|date=August 19, 2014|access-date=March 8, 2015}}</ref> Paul, however, had been strictly resistant to the idea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vinnie-paul-if-you-live-in-the-past-you-dont-have-any-future/|title=Vinnie Paul: 'If You Live In The Past, You Don't Have Any Future' |website=Blabbermouth.net|date=July 29, 2014|access-date=March 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vinnie-paul-people-who-continue-to-ask-about-pantera-reunion-are-selfish/|title=Vinnie Paul: People Who Continue To Ask About Pantera 'Reunion' Are 'Selfish' |website=Blabbermouth.net|date=August 26, 2014|access-date=March 8, 2015}}</ref> Despite several overtures towards reconciliation by Anselmo towards Paul, the two men remained permanently estranged.

In a July 2015 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Anselmo spoke out against Pantera and his other band's usage of the [[Confederate flag]] claiming it was a mistake to use it on their merchandise, albums, and other promotional material. Anselmo said "These days, I wouldn't want anything to fucking do with it because truthfully... I wouldn't. The way I feel and the group of people I've had to work with my whole life, you see a Confederate flag out there that says 'Heritage, not hate.' I'm not so sure I'm buying into that." Anselmo said originally that Pantera used the image because they were huge fans of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] but it was never about promoting hate.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Phil Anselmo on Confederate Flag: I Don't Want Anything to Do With It|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/phil-anselmo-on-confederate-flag-i-dont-want-anything-to-do-with-it-20150713|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=July 13, 2015}}</ref>

Also in 2015, Anselmo and Brown were interviewed at length about Pantera for the book ''Survival of the Fittest: Heavy Metal in the 1990s'', by author Greg Prato.

==== Reissues ====
Between 2010 and 2020, Pantera's five major label studio albums had all been reissued, typically with extra content.

In 2010, a 20th anniversary edition of ''Cowboys from Hell'' was released, and it included the unreleased outtake track "The Will to Survive" along with various demo versions of the album's songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2010/07/panteras_cowboys_from_hell_to.php|title=Pantera's Cowboys From Hell To Receive Deluxe, 20th Anniversary Edition Re-Issue|first=Pete|last=Freedman|date=July 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725082641/http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2010/07/panteras_cowboys_from_hell_to.php |access-date=July 12, 2022|archive-date=July 25, 2010 }}</ref>

On April 11, 2012, at the Revolver Golden God Awards a new song, titled "Piss", was debuted after being discovered in the Pantera "vaults" by Vinnie Paul. A music video was made for "Piss" and shown at the awards show and, according to Vinnie Paul, it was the only complete previously unheard Pantera track. It was recorded during the ''Vulgar Display of Power'' sessions. The track was included on the 20th anniversary edition of ''Vulgar Display of Power'', and the single peaked at No.&nbsp;23 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The reissue also included a live DVD from a concert in Italy.<ref>{{cite web |title= Pantera- Piss|date=April 12, 2012 |url=http://www.metalcallout.com/metal-music-videos/new-video-pantera-piss.html|publisher=MetalcallOut.com |access-date=April 12, 2012}}</ref>

On March 22, 2014, Pantera released a 20th anniversary edition of ''Far Beyond Driven''. All songs were remastered, and as a bonus, they released a live recording of their 1994 "[[Monsters of Rock]]" performance. Unlike the prior two reissues, no previously unheard songs or outtake tracks were included.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/pantera-far-beyond-driven-20th-anniversary-edition-to-arrive-in-march/#5WtDr1Q2RsbkAz8z.99 |title=Pantera: 'Far Beyond Driven: 20th Anniversary Edition' To Arrive In March |work=Blabbermouth.net |date=January 21, 2014 |access-date=July 3, 2014}}</ref>

''The Great Southern Trendkill'' was reissued in 2016 for its 20th anniversary. The bonus content included instrumental versions, different mixes, demo takes, and live versions of the album's songs. Similar to ''Far Beyond Driven'', no previously unheard compositions or non-album songs were included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/pantera-the-great-southern-trendkill-20th-anniversary-edition/|title=Pantera's 'The Great Southern Trendkill' Gets 20th Anniversary Edition|website=[[Loudwire]]|date=August 12, 2016 |access-date=July 12, 2022}}</ref>

In 2020, ''Reinventing the Steel'' was also reissued for its 20th anniversary. It had consisted of the album's songs remastered along with alternate mixes, radio edits, and instrumental mixes. Five non-album tracks (which were initially featured on soundtracks or as B-sides to the singles) were included as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/pantera-reinventing-the-steel-expanded-20th-anniversary-reissue-details-revealed|title=PANTERA: 'Reinventing The Steel' Expanded 20th-Anniversary Reissue Details Revealed|website=[[Blabbermouth]]|date=September 10, 2020 |access-date=July 12, 2022}}</ref>

Pantera toured on [[Ozzfest]] as main stage acts twice; the band played at the second annual Ozzfest in 1997 and the fifth Ozzfest in 2000. Over the course of their career, Pantera's members became known for their excessive partying and debauchery, even acquiring an official drink called the "Black Tooth Grin". The "Black Tooth Grin" ("Black Tooth", "The Grin", or "BTG", alternatively), named after lyrics from [[Megadeth]]'s "[[Sweating Bullets (song)|Sweating Bullets]]", is a mixture of [[Crown Royal]] or [[Seagram|Seagram 7]] [[whisky]] (or both) and [[Coca-Cola]]. Conversely, Brown noted that the band never drank in the studio, in order to stay focused writing and recording.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q82fv_fMnQ|title=Icons: Rex Brown of Pantera|date=December 9, 2022 |via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

Aside from their post-glam, thrash metal influences, the band members cite heavy metal pioneers [[Black Sabbath]] as one of their favorite bands. As a tribute, Pantera has recorded three different covers of Black Sabbath songs (all from the [[Ozzy Osbourne]] era). The first was "[[Planet Caravan]]", a slower, quieter song planned for the first Sabbath tribute album, ''[[Nativity in Black]]'', that eventually became the final track on ''Far Beyond Driven''. The band performed Sabbath's "Electric Funeral" on the second ''Nativity in Black''. A previously unreleased cover of Sabbath's "[[Hole in the Sky (song)|Hole in the Sky]]" was included on the band's 2003 compilation album, ''The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits!'' Pantera's affinity for Black Sabbath is also shown through the lyrics, "Your trust is in whiskey and weed and Black Sabbath", in "Goddamn Electric". 

In a 2019 interview with ''[[MetalHammer]]'', the band explained that their move away from glam began in early 1988, when Anselmo played "[[At Dawn they Sleep]]", by [[Slayer]], for Darrell Abbott. Subsequently, Anselmo's vocals became inspired by [[Agnostic Front]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], and the instrumentalists by Slayer, [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], [[Faith No More]]'s ''[[The Real Thing (Faith No More album)|The Real Thing]]'' (1989) and [[Soundgarden]]'s ''[[Louder Than Love]]'' (1989).<ref name="loudersound 2019">{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-behind-cowboys-from-hell-by-pantera|title=The Story Behind: Cowboys From Hell by Pantera|publisher=[[Metal Hammer|Loudersound]]|date=December 3, 2019|access-date=June 21, 2023}}</ref> Pantera's other influences or inspirations include [[AC/DC]],<ref name="loudersound 2020">{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/dimeradio-dimebag-darrells-top-tracks-as-chosen-by-vinnie-paul|title=These were Dimebag Darrell's 10 favourite songs, according to Vinnie Paul|publisher=[[Metal Hammer|Loudersound]]|date=December 3, 2019|access-date=June 21, 2023}}</ref> [[Accept (band)|Accept]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wpdh.com/german-heavy-metal-legends-accept-make-hudson-valley-return/|title=German Heavy Metal Legends Accept Make Hudson Valley Return|publisher=[[WPDH|wpdh.com]]|date=December 3, 2019|access-date=June 21, 2023}}</ref> [[Aerosmith]],<ref name="musicradar 2017">{{cite web|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/rex-brown-the-10-records-that-changed-my-life|title=Rex Brown: the 10 records that changed my life|publisher=musicradar.com|date=August 15, 2017|access-date=June 21, 2023}}</ref> [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]],<ref name="ultimateguitar 2023">{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/panteras_cowboys_from_hell_album_has_been_certified_double_platinum_in_the_us.html|title=Pantera's 'Cowboys From Hell' Album Has Been Certified Double Platinum in the U.S.|publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar]]|date=June 1, 2023|access-date=June 21, 2023}}</ref> [[the Beatles]],<ref name="musicradar 2017" /><ref name="ultimateclassicrock 2011">{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/pantera-phil-anselmo-beatles-kiss-influences/|title=Ex-Pantera Singer Phil Anselmo Cites Beatles, Kiss as Early Influences|publisher=[[Townsquare Media|Ultimate Classic Rock]]|date=July 18, 2011|access-date=June 21, 2023}}</ref> [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]],<ref name="Daniels, 2013">{{cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Neil |author-link=Neil Daniels |title=Reinventing Metal The True Story of Pantera and the Tragically Short Life of Dimebag Darrell |date=August 2013 |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |quote=Leaving overzealous fan debates aside, Pantera spent much of 1990 touring in support of Cowboys from Hell.

===Ideology and lyrical themes===
Pantera adopted a self-described "take no shit" attitude, epitomized in its song "[[5 Minutes Alone]]" from the album ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]''. According to Vinnie Paul, the song originated from an incident during a show in San Diego, California; Anselmo was annoyed by a heckler and encouraged the crowd to beat him up. Consequently, the band was sued by the father of the heckler who said he wanted "five minutes alone" with Anselmo to prove who was the "big daddy". Anselmo responded that he would use those "five minutes alone" with the father to "whoop his ass."<ref name="donkaye" />

Despite being a standard glam metal band early in their career, the band members perceive themselves to have subsequently had an uncompromising career in which they never "[[selling out|sold out]]" or gave in to trends. This is most noticeably highlighted in the themes and title of ''The Great Southern Trendkill''. Anselmo said:

{{blockquote|We've survived every fucking trend—heavy metal, "[[grunge]] metal", [[funk metal]], [[rap metal]]—and we're still here. We put everyone on notice that we don't fuck around. Our fans know we're true right down to the fucking core.<ref name="Pantera.com Band">{{cite web|url=http://pantera.com/band.htm| url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101044450/http://pantera.com/band.htm|title=Official Pantera|archive-date=November 1, 2013 |access-date=8 March 2015}}</ref>}}

Similarly, the die-hard attitude of "We'll Grind That Axe for a Long Time" (from ''Reinventing the Steel'') is, according to Anselmo, "in a way, our motto."<ref name="Pantera.com Band"/>

===Comparisons with Exhorder===
[[New Orleans]] heavy metal band [[Exhorder]] have suggested that Pantera copied their sound during the change from glam metal to groove metal. Pantera's ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'', marking a major stylistic shift, was released just before Exhorder's debut, ''[[Slaughter in the Vatican]]''. However, Exhorder self-released two demos in the late 1980s (around the time that Pantera was still playing [[glam metal]]). Exhorder's members allege Pantera copied these demos.<ref>{{cite web |title=Former Exhorder Frontman: 'Did Pantera Rip Us Off? Possibly' |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-exhorder-frontman-did-pantera-rip-us-off-possibly |website=Blabbermouth|date=April 22, 2007 }}</ref>

A review at [[AllMusic]] noted some "striking similarities" between the two bands, both emphasizing mid-tempo songs and "gruff but very expressive" lead singers – similarities that fueled debate about whether one band imitated the other. In disagreement with the opinion that Exhorder is "Pantera minus the good songs", AllMusic's review of ''Slaughter in the Vatican'' expresses that "perhaps a more accurate billing would be to call them Pantera without the major label backing." In explaining Exhorder's much less successful career, AllMusic also point to the fact that the title of their debut, along with the blatantly provocative album cover, "certainly didn't help [their] cause any."<ref name="exhorder">{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r6976|pure_url=yes}} | title = ''Slaughter in the Vatican'' review | work = [[AllMusic]] | access-date = October 21, 2005}}</ref>

However, some critics dispute any notion that Pantera imitated Exhorder's sound. Brian Davis, a contributor to Internet radio station [[KBUE#KNAC|KNAC]], addresses the issue as follows:

{{blockquote|Exhorder's main "claim to fame" is the common opinion that they're the band that Pantera stole their sound from. That's total bullshit. There are minor similarities in guitar style, and on occasion, vocalist Kyle Thomas spits out a line or scream that will bring Pantera to mind, but to go so far as to say that Pantera is an Exhorder clone is ludicrous.<ref name="briandavis">{{cite web | url = http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=2628&StartTime=12%2F9%2F2003+10%3A10%3A37+AM | title = Exhorder ''Slaughter in the Vatican/The Law'' 2-in-1 Re-Release | work = [[KNAC]].com | access-date = October 21, 2005}}</ref>}}

Although originally decrying Pantera as a rip-off of their sound, Exhorder lead vocalist Kyle Thomas has stated that he does not care about any of the criticism and is sick of seeing Exhorder's name tied to Pantera's. He also stated that he and the members of Pantera were great friends who used to tour together, and that he mourns the loss of Dimebag Darrell.<ref name="kylethomas">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.blistering.com/news/newsdet.php3?ID=3846 |title=Kyle Thomas Speaks Out on the Pantera/Exhorder 'Feud' |magazine=[[Blistering (magazine)|Blistering]] |access-date=November 5, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235512/http://www.blistering.com/news/newsdet.php3?ID=3846 |archive-date=September 26, 2007 }}</ref><ref name="dimebagloss">{{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=30285 | title = Former Exhorder Frontman: We 'Lost An Innovator, A Warrior, And A Metal God' | date=December 12, 2004 | work = [[Blabbermouth.net]] | access-date = November 5, 2005}}</ref> Guitarist Marzi Montazeri, however, who worked with Anselmo on one of his solo projects, said that Anselmo "ripped off" Thomas' vocal style, {{"'}}cause he was doing Rob Halford stuff back then, when he first joined Pantera.
