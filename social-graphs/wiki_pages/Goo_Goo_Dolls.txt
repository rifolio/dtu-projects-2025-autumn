After starting off as a cover band and then developing a punk sound, Goo Goo Dolls experienced mainstream success following the 1995 release of their breakthrough single, "[[Name (song)|Name]]". The band is renowned for their 1998 single, "[[Iris (song)|Iris]]", which spent 11 consecutive months on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and peaked atop the [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart for 18 weeks. In October 2012, "Iris" placed first on ''Billboard''{{'}}s "Top 100 Pop Songs 1992–2012" chart. Other notable singles include "[[Slide (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Slide]]", "[[Black Balloon (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Black Balloon]]", and "[[Broadway (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Broadway]]" from ''[[Dizzy Up the Girl]]'' (1998); "[[Here Is Gone]]" from ''[[Gutterflower]]'' (2002); and "[[Better Days (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Better Days]]", "[[Give a Little Bit#Goo Goo Dolls version|Give a Little Bit]]", and "[[Stay with You (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Stay with You]]" from [[Let Love In (Goo Goo Dolls album)|''Let Love In'']] (2006).

The band has had seven top-40 singles on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, which includes three top tens.<ref>{{Cite press release |author=<!--no by-line.--> |date=October 5, 2010 |title=Goo Goo Dolls Break Own Record for Most Top 10 Singles on Billboard/BDS Adult Top 40 Chart |website=marketwired.com |publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] |url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Goo-Goo-Dolls-Break-Own-Record-Most-Top-10-Singles-on-Billboard-BDS-Adult-Top-40-Chart-1329897.htm |access-date=November 8, 2016 |archive-date=December 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220000023/http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Goo-Goo-Dolls-Break-Own-Record-Most-Top-10-Singles-on-Billboard-BDS-Adult-Top-40-Chart-1329897.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> They have sold 15 million records worldwide,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mohavedailynews.com/news/133190/goo-goo-dolls-collective-soul-ready-to-rock-lec/|title=Goo Goo Dolls, Collective Soul ready to rock LEC|website=mohavedailynews.com|access-date=October 28, 2021|archive-date=March 24, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230324173325/https://mohavedailynews.com/news/133190/goo-goo-dolls-collective-soul-ready-to-rock-lec/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/goo-goo-dolls-release-new-album-of-rare-never-before-heard-songs|title=Goo Goo Dolls Release New Album Of Rare & Never-Before-Heard Songs|first=Bass|last=Magazine|website=Bass Magazine - The Future of Bass|date=June 25, 2021 }}</ref> and received four [[Grammy Award]] nominations.

== History ==

=== Origins and early music (1986–1993) ===
The band's original lineup included [[John Rzeznik]] (guitar, vocals), [[Robby Takac]] (bass, vocals), and [[George Tutuska]] (drums, percussion). Takac and Tutuska had been long-time friends in school and met Rzeznik while he was playing in the band The Beaumonts with Takac's cousin, [[Paul Takac]], and close friend Michael Harvey who was the inspiration for the band.<ref>{{cite web |last=Morano |first=Scott |year=1996 |title=Goo Goo Dolls FAQ |publisher=Music Fan Clubs |work=musicfanclubs.org |url=http://www.musicfanclubs.org/googoodolls/misc/faq.htm#1 |access-date=November 8, 2016 |archive-date=March 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315060546/http://www.musicfanclubs.org/googoodolls/misc/faq.htm#1 |url-status=live }}</ref>  In 1999 Rolling Stone reported the trio picked their name from a ''[[True Detective (magazine)|True Detective]]'' ad for a toy called a Goo Goo Doll.<ref>''Rolling Stone'', November 1999.</ref> In 2022, Rzeznik said he didn't remember how they picked the name. "We had a gig and so we had to come up with some kind of a name just to play the show", Rzeznik said. "It's kind of a stupid name."<ref>{{Citation |last=Lee |first=Yuna |title=John Rzeznik says he regrets the name 'Goo Goo Dolls' |date=August 3, 2022 |url=https://www.4029tv.com/article/goo-goo-dolls-name/40798256 |language=en |access-date=August 4, 2022}}</ref>

The band started out playing covers, but went on to develop a punk sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2019/9/10/20858182/goo-goo-dolls-miracle-pill-interview|title=The Goo Goo Dolls Were Never the Cool Kids, but They're Still Standing|first=Rob|last=Harvilla|date=September 10, 2019|website=The Ringer}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/goo-goo-dolls|title=The Goo Goo Dolls &#124; Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref> With Takac as their lead singer, the band released their first album, ''[[Goo Goo Dolls (album)|Goo Goo Dolls]],'' in 1987 on Mercenary Records, but was picked up in 1988 by [[Celluloid Records]], a larger record company. They played around Buffalo's underground music circuit and across the country opening for punk bands such as [[Gang Green]], [[SNFU]], [[Dag Nasty]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Motörhead]], [[All (band)|ALL]], [[The Dead Milkmen]], Doughboys, [[Big Drill Car]], [[The Gun Club]], [[Uniform Choice]], [[The Dickies]], and [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|DRI]] and playing with fellow Buffalo bands. The band released its second album, ''[[Jed (album)|Jed]]'', in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=B.

The band released its third album, ''[[Hold Me Up]]'', in 1990 and featured Rzeznik as the lead vocalist on five tracks, including the single "There You Are"—as well as their then-concert favorite, "Two Days in February". After being embraced by local [[college radio]] and punk scenes (including such venues as [[CBGB]]), the Goo Goo Dolls incorporated elements of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[pop rock]], and [[punk rock]] into the album. In 1991, the song "I'm Awake Now" was recorded for the soundtrack of ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

''[[Superstar Car Wash]]'', released in 1993, received significant media attention. The critical success and encouraging sales of their last album resulted in a larger budget from [[Metal Blade Records]]. The album was partially recorded at [[Metalworks Studios]] in [[Mississauga, Ontario]]. The single "We Are the Normal", co-written with [[Paul Westerberg]] of [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], Westerberg providing the lyrics, received a major push toward play on college and independent radio, and its video was displayed on MTV's [[120 Minutes]] program. "Fallin' Down" made it onto the 1993 soundtrack of [[Pauly Shore]]'s hit film ''[[Son in Law (film)|Son in Law]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 10, 2024 |title=Son in Law Soundtrack |url=https://www.tunefind.com/movie/son-in-law-1993-us |access-date=September 10, 2024 |website=Tunefind}}</ref>

=== Mainstream success, ''A Boy Named Goo'', legal issues, and Tutuska's departure (1993–1997) ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2020}} 
Just before ''A Boy Named Goo'''s release, Tutuska was fired from the band and replaced by [[Mike Malinin]].<ref name="iwarp1"/> Prior to Tutuska's departure, there was a payment dispute between him and Rzeznik over Tutuska's contribution to the writing of the ''[[Superstar Car Wash]]'' single "Fallin' Down". During the completion of ''[[A Boy Named Goo]]'', Tutuska had told band management that he would not tour behind the album unless royalties were to be split evenly among the three members, a practice Tutuska said had been the band's standard practice ever since the release of its self-titled debut in 1987. Tutuska has said that when he told Rzeznik he had not received royalties from "Fallin' Down", Rzeznik admitted that he had been receiving such royalties for two years.<ref name="iwarp1">{{cite web|url=http://googoodolls.iwarp.com/rs081099.htm |title=From Rolling Stone 8 |publisher=Googoodolls.iwarp.com |date=August 10, 1999 |access-date=November 23, 2015}}</ref>

''A Boy Named Goo'', released in 1995, had a catchy rock sound, and became one of the most successful alternative rock albums of the mid-1990s. ''A Boy Named Goo'' became the first album in [[Metal Blade Records|Metal Blade]] history to achieve double-platinum status. The single "Name" was particularly successful on the record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://concerty.com/artist/the-goo-goo-dolls-552249|title=Goo Goo Dolls Biography|website=Concerty.com}}</ref> This success, however, proved bittersweet, as the band found themselves in a legal battle with Metal Blade. The band filed suit against Metal Blade, claiming they had not earned any royalties from their album's sales, which was attributed to a "grossly unfair, one-sided and unenforceable contract" which had been signed by the band in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--no by-line--> |date=December 2, 1996 |title=Goo Goo Dolls Want Label to Forget Their Name |publisher=Rolling Stone |work=rollingstone.com |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/googoodolls/articles/story/5927020/goo_goo_dolls_want_label_to_forget_their_name |access-date=November 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194335/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/googoodolls/articles/story/5927020/goo_goo_dolls_want_label_to_forget_their_name |archive-date=October 12, 2007}}</ref> The two sides reached a settlement which had the band signed to the Metal Blade's distributing label, [[Warner Bros.

=== ''Dizzy Up the Girl'' and ''Gutterflower'' (1997–2005) ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2020}} 
Rzeznik was approached to write a song for the ''[[City of Angels (soundtrack)|City of Angels]]'' soundtrack, and the end product was "[[Iris (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Iris]]".  Session guitarist [[Tim Pierce]] played the mandolin intro and also the slide guitar solo.  This song continued the band's fame, as it stayed on top of ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100 Airplay]] charts for a record-breaking 18 weeks and spent 4 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Pop Songs chart. Iris held the record for the most weeks on the radio for almost 22 years before [[The Weeknd]] released "[[Blinding Lights]]" and broke the long-standing record on August 22, 2020. Shortly after Iris was released in 1998, it was nominated for three Grammys. According to several interviews with Rzeznik, he was experiencing serious bouts of writer's block when he was approached, and was on the verge of quitting the band days before he wrote the song.<ref name="Interview with Johnny Rzeznik">{{cite web |last=Lovelady |first=Lyndsey |date=September 6, 2010 |title=Multi Platinum Man: An Interview With Goo Goo Dolls' Johnny Rzeznik |work=American Songwriter |url=https://www.americansongwriter.com/2010/09/multi-platinum-man-a-qa-with-goo-goo-dolls-johnny-rzeznik/ |access-date=November 8, 2016 |archive-date=May 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511053745/http://americansongwriter.com/2010/09/multi-platinum-man-a-qa-with-goo-goo-dolls-johnny-rzeznik/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

"Iris" was included on the quintuple-platinum ''[[Dizzy Up the Girl]]'', considered their most successful album, and was among top-ten hits "[[Slide (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Slide]]", "[[Black Balloon (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Black Balloon]]", "[[Broadway (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Broadway]]", and "[[Dizzy (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Dizzy]]" from the same album. In 2001, the Goos released their first ever compilation CD, ''[[What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce]]''. Next, ''[[Gutterflower]]'' (2002) achieved gold certification, producing the hits "[[Here Is Gone]]", "[[Sympathy (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Sympathy]]", and "[[Big Machine (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Big Machine]]". On July 4, 2004, the band performed a free concert in Buffalo, playing through a deluge of rain that can be seen on the DVD released later that year. The DVD also contained a studio version of the Goo Goo Dolls' cover of "[[Give a Little Bit]]" by [[Supertramp]].
