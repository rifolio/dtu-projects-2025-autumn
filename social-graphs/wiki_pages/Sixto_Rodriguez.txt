'''Sixto Diaz Rodríguez''' (July 10, 1942 – August 8, 2023),  mononymously known as '''Rodríguez''', was an American musician from [[Detroit]], Michigan.

Though his career was initially  met with little fanfare in the United States, he found success in [[South Africa]], [[Australia]] (touring the country twice in his earlier career), and New Zealand. Unbeknownst to him for decades, his music grew extremely successful and influential in South Africa, where he is believed to have sold more records than [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/searching-for-sugar-man-documentary-rediscovers-musician-sixto-rodriguez/2012/07/25/gJQAUS8VBX_story.html|title='Searching for Sugar Man' documentary rediscovers musician Sixto Rodriguez|last=Malitz|first=David|date=July 26, 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=May 13, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>[[Malik Bendjelloul|Bendjelloul, Malik]], director.

In the 1990s, determined South African fans managed to find and contact Rodriguez, which led to an unexpected revival of his musical career. This was told in the 2012 [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary film ''[[Searching for Sugar Man]]'' and helped give Rodriguez a measure of fame in his home country. In May 2013, Rodriguez received an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degree from his alma mater, [[Wayne State University]], in Detroit.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Herrera |first=Halston |date=2013-04-29 |title=Detroit folk singer Sixto Rodriguez to get honorary doctoral degree from Wayne State University |url=https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/2013/04/29/detroit-folk-singer-sixto-rodriguez-to-get-honorary-doctoral-degree-from-wayne-state-university/ |access-date=2023-11-06 |website=ClickOnDetroit.com |language=en}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Sixto Rodriguez Way Out West 2013.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Sixto Rodriguez at Way Out West in Gothenburg, Sweden, 2013]]
Sixto Diaz Rodriguez was born on July 10, 1942, in Detroit, Michigan. He was the sixth child of Mexican immigrant working-class parents Ramon and Maria Rodriguez. His mother died when he was three years old.<ref name="Socialstereotype">{{cite web |url=http://www.socialstereotype.com/_/Features/Entries/2008/8/11_RODRIGUEZ.html |title=Rodriguez |publisher=Socialstereotype.com |date=July 10, 1942 |access-date=June 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130616001318/http://www.socialstereotype.com/_/Features/Entries/2008/8/11_RODRIGUEZ.html |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> They had joined an influx of Mexicans who came to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] to work in Detroit's industries.<ref>Vargas, Zaragosa.

===Recording career===
In 1967, using the name "Rod Riguez" (given by his record label), he released a single, "I'll Slip Away", on the small Impact label. He did not record again for three years, until he signed with [[Sussex Records]], then an offshoot of [[Buddah Records]]. He used his preferred professional name, "Rodriguez", after that. He recorded two albums with Sussex, ''[[Cold Fact]]'' in 1970 and ''[[Coming from Reality]]'' in November 1971. However, both sold few copies in the U.S. and he was dropped by Sussex two weeks before Christmas 1971, and Sussex itself closed in 1975.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Macamba |date=August 16, 2023 |title=Rodriguez |url=https://rockandrollparadise.com/sixto-rodriguez-8-2023/ |magazine=Rock and Roll Paradise |publisher=Rock and Roll Paradise |access-date=September 6, 2023}}</ref> While  ''Searching for Sugar Man'' implied that he was in the process of recording a third album when Sussex dropped him, in 2013 Rodriguez told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that he unsuccessfully lobbied filmmakers to cut a reference to his unfinished third album. He told the magazine, "To me it distracted. It almost cheapened the film, like it was a promo film.… I’ve written about 30 songs, and that’s pretty much what the public has heard."<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Flanary |first=Patrick |date=January 29, 2013 |title=Rodriguez Weighs Potential Third Album |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rodriguez-weighs-potential-third-album-184970/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |publisher=Penske Media Corporation |access-date=September 6, 2023}}</ref>

Rodriguez quit his music career and in 1976 he purchased a derelict Detroit house in a government auction for $50 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|1976}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in which he still lived as of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.sugarman.org/2013/02/02/wife-of-oscar-nominated-searching-for-sugar-man-star-rodriguez-says-hell-stay-in-50-detroit-home-mlive-com/|title=Wife of Oscar-nominated 'Searching for Sugar Man' star Rodriguez says he'll stay in $50 Detroit home - MLive.com|date=February 2, 2013}}</ref> He worked in demolition and production line work, always earning a low income. He remained politically active and motivated to improve the lives of the city's working-class inhabitants and had run unsuccessfully several times for public office: for the [[Detroit City Council]] in 1989, for [[Mayor of Detroit]] in 1981 and 1993 and for the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=220968|title=Rodriguez, Sixto|publisher=Our Campaigns|access-date=December 27, 2015}}</ref>

In 2013, it was announced that Rodriguez was in discussions with [[Steve Rowland (record producer)|Steve Rowland]], the producer of his ''Coming From Reality'' album. "I've written about thirty new songs," Rodriguez told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. "He told me to send him a couple of tapes, so I'm gonna do that. I certainly want to look him up, because now he's full of ideas."<ref>{{cite web|last=Michaels|first=Sean|title=Rodriguez set to return to studio after 42-year absence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/30/rodriguez-returns-studio-after-42-years|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=January 30, 2013|access-date=January 30, 2013}}</ref>

===International fame===

Although Rodriguez remained relatively unknown in his home country, by the mid-1970s his albums were starting to gain significant airplay in Australia, [[Botswana]], New Zealand, [[Zimbabwe]] and South Africa.<ref name="NZH Tour">{{cite news |title=Tour news: Sugar Man on his way |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/tour-news-sugar-man-on-his-way/2JHC4RLIZAHE3QLFHV7Z3ZZC5I/ |access-date=August 9, 2023 |work=The New Zealand Herald |publisher=New Zealand Media and Entertainment |date=20 January 2013}}</ref><ref name="IPBM Rags">{{cite news |title=Rags to Rags: The Lost Tale of Detroit's Sugar Man aka Sixto Rodriguez |url=https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2012/11/rags-to-rags-lost-tale-of-detroits.html |access-date=August 9, 2023 |work=It's Psychedelic Baby Magazine |date=November 28, 2012}}</ref>

When imported copies of his Sussex albums were sold out, an Australian record label, Blue Goose Music, bought the Australian rights to his recordings. Blue Goose released his two studio albums as well as a compilation album, ''[[Rodriguez at His Best|At His Best]]'', that featured unreleased recordings from 1973 – "Can't Get Away", "I'll Slip Away" (a re-recording of his first single), and "Street Boy".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.discogs.com/release/1249413-Rodriguez-At-His-Best | title=Rodriguez – at His Best | website=[[Discogs]] | date=August 12, 1977 }}</ref>

''At His Best'' went platinum in South Africa, which at one stage was the major disc-press source of his music to the rest of the world. Rodriguez was compared to contemporaries such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Cat Stevens]]. Many of his songs carry anti-establishment themes, and therefore boosted anti-apartheid protest culture in South Africa<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/07/28/157478577/rodriguez-forgotten-in-america-exalted-in-africa|title=Rodriguez: Forgotten in America, Exalted in Africa|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=July 28, 2012}}</ref> where his work influenced the music scene at the time and was also a considerable influence on a generation drafted, mostly unwillingly, to the then whites-only South African military. Reportedly, anti-apartheid activist [[Steve Biko]] was also a Rodriguez fan.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/a-conversation-with-searching-for-sugar-man-director-malik-bendjelloul-8429429.html A conversation with Searching For Sugar Man director, Malik Bendjelloul], ''[[The Independent]]'', December 21, 2012.</ref>

Rodriguez was also successful in Australia and performed two concert tours across the country in 1979 and 1981 after Australian concert promoters had tracked him down in Detroit.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT119 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |title=Rodriguez Is Australian Cult |date=April 7, 1979}}</ref> At his first performance in Sydney he reportedly mumbled in front of a big audience, "Eight years later ... and this happens. I don’t believe it." Rodriguez later stated that after his second tour in Australia he thought it was the highlight of his career, and that "not much happened after that. No calls or anything.”<ref name="auto">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rodriguez-10-things-you-dont-know-about-the-searching-for-sugar-man-star-99288/ | title=Rodriguez: 10 Things You Don't Know About the 'Searching for Sugar Man' Star | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=March 28, 2013 }}</ref>

In 1991, both of his albums were released on CD in South Africa for the first time, which helped preserve his fame. However, few details of his life were known to his fans and it was rumored that he had killed himself during a concert in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66449150 | title=Sixto Rodriguez: Searching for Sugar Man singer dies aged 81 | work=BBC News | date=August 9, 2023 }}</ref>

{{anchor|Eva}}Despite his success abroad, Rodriguez's fame in South Africa had remained unknown to him until 1997 when his eldest daughter, Eva, came across a website dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,16373,1586094,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The singer who came back from the dead | first=Alexis | last=Petridis | date=October 7, 2005 | access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> After contacting the website and learning of his fame in the country, Rodriguez went on his first South African tour, playing six concerts before thousands of fans. A documentary, ''Dead Men Don't Tour: Rodriguez in South Africa'' was made in 1998. He also performed in Sweden before returning to South Africa in 2001 and 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://medium.com/@vanko/jesus-sixto-rodriguez-performance-at-kalamazoo-state-theater-47253253bbdc | title=Jesus Sixto Rodriguez performance at Kalamazoo State Theater | date=December 14, 2015 }}</ref>

In 1998, Rodriguez's signature song, "[[Sugar Man (song)|Sugar Man]]", was covered by the South African rock band [[Just Jinger|Just Jinjer]] (then spelled ''Just Jinger'') and, later, by the Scottish singer-songwriter [[Paolo Nutini]]. In 2002, it was used by disc-jockey [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]] to open his mix album, ''Come Get It I Got It'', gaining Rodriguez more international airplay. "Sugar Man" had previously gained even more fame by having been sampled in the song "You're Da Man" in rapper [[Nas]]'s 2001 album ''[[Stillmatic]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brian Currin |url=http://www.sugarman.org/rod_sample.html |title=Rodriguez – The Music: "...You're Da Man, Sugar Man..." |publisher=Sugarman.org |access-date=June 17, 2013}}</ref>

In January, 2012, the [[Sundance Film Festival]] hosted the premiere of the documentary film ''Searching for Sugar Man'', by Swedish director [[Malik Bendjelloul]], detailing the efforts of two South African fans to see if his rumored death was true and, if not, to discover what had become of him. The documentary, produced by Simon Chinn and John Battsek, went on to win the World Cinema Special Jury Prize and the Audience Award, World Cinema Documentary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yuan |first=Jada |url=https://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2012/01/sundance-the-electrifying-search-for-sugar-man.html |title=Sundance: The Electrifying Search For Sugar Man |date=January 21, 2012 |work=New York |access-date=June 17, 2013}}</ref>

===Belated success in the United States and Europe===
After the cinematic release of ''Searching for Sugar Man'' in 2012, Rodriguez experienced a flush of media exposure and fan interest in the United States, as well as Europe. He appeared as a musical guest on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on August 14, 2012, performing "Crucify Your Mind",<ref>{{Citation |title=Rodriguez Performs "Crucify Your Mind" {{!}} Letterman | date=August 9, 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhMxmubp-5Q |access-date=2024-03-09 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Russell |first=Calum |date=2023-08-09 |title=Revisit Sixto Rodriguez's thrilling debut on David Letterman |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/revisit-sixto-rodriguezs-spectacular-debut-on-david-letterman/ |access-date=2023-11-06 |website=Far Out Magazine |language=}}</ref> and performed "Can't Get Away" on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on January 11, 2013.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

Prominent news coverage included a mid-August 2012 [[CNN]] feature story with an interview of Rodriguez discussing his life and career resurgence. On October 7, 2012, Rodriguez was featured on the U.S. television news program ''[[60 Minutes]]''.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rodriguez-the-rock-icon-who-didnt-know-it/ Rodriguez: The Rock Icon Who Didn't Know It], reported by Bob Simon, segment produced by Michael Gavshon, CBS News, October 7, 2012.</ref> On November 18, 2012, Rodriguez was interviewed on the U.K. Sunday morning news program ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'', where he also played a short song over the closing credits.

Rodriguez received additional exposure in 2014 as the [[Dave Matthews Band]] often covered "Sugar Man" in their summer tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dmbalmanac.com/songs/summary.aspx?sid=781|title=DMBAlmanac.com²|website=Dmbalmanac.com|access-date=July 10, 2025}}</ref> Matthews would often preface the song with his experience as a fan of Rodriguez growing up in South Africa and his surprise at Rodriguez's lack of popularity in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Finding Sugar Man: The Day Dave Matthews Met Rodriguez |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/dave-matthews-rodriguez-sugar-man-cover |access-date=2024-03-09 |website=JamBase |language=en-US |quote=…I discovered when I came back here (from South Africa) was that nobody ever heard of this guy …he was as important to me as Bob Dylan, as Cat Stevens, as Marvin Gaye… And all these people never heard of him?… I got to meet him today and it was a highlight of my life…}}</ref>

The film ''Searching for Sugar Man'' strongly implied that Rodriguez had been cheated out of royalties over the years, specifically by [[Clarence Avant]].  Rodriguez first expressed indifference to these "symbols of success" but then filed a lawsuit in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/23/rodriguez-royalties-musician-south-africa_n_2749409.html|title=Rodriguez Seeks Lost Royalties From Albums Sold Overseas While He Lived In Obscurity|website=[[HuffPost]] |date=March 5, 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305084315/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/23/rodriguez-royalties-musician-south-africa_n_2749409.html|archive-date=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2022, the year before his death, the lawsuit was reported to have been settled with no amount disclosed.<ref name=vandenheever>{{citation |last=van den Heever |first=Megan|title=Paid his dues: Sixto 'Sugar Man' Rodriguez to get royalties by 80th birthday| newspaper=[[The South African]] |date=October 6, 2022 |url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/celeb-news/sixto-rodriguez-music-album-at-his-best-sugar-man-bootleg-south-africa-tour-latest-news/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Culliford |first=Graeme |title='Sugar Man' Sixto Rodriguez wins battle for royalties payout ahead of 80th birthday |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/sugar-man-sixto-rodriguez-wins-27146924 |access-date=July 3, 2022}}</ref>

===Later activity===
In 2015, Craig Bartholomew Strydom and Stephen "Sugar" Segerman published a book entitled ''Sugar Man: The Life, Death and Resurrection of Sixto Rodriguez''.<ref name="Bdlive2015-11-13" /> A review in ''Business Day'' called the book "probably one of the most unusual rock 'n roll stories out there".{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

Rodriguez headlined a tour in August 2018,<ref name="Irish Mirror">{{Cite web |last=O'Toole |first=Scarlett |date=2023-08-09 |title=Legendary Sugar Man singer Sixto Rodriguez dies after suffering a stroke |url=https://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/celebrity-news/legendary-sugar-man-singer-sixto-30665289 |access-date=2024-03-09 |website=Irish Mirror |language=en}}</ref> ending with a hometown show at Detroit's Garden Theater.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mqq0c222dQ |title=Rodriguez "Sixteen Tons" LIVE @ The Garden Theater, Detroit 8-31-2018|website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref> His final North American concert tour in late 2019/early 2020 culminated on February 20, 2020, at Nashville's City Winery.

Rodriguez and the process of his rediscovery was the subject of a 2022 episode of ''Outlook'' on the [[BBC World Service]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=BBC World Service – Outlook, My hunt for Rodriguez, a missing music legend |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct34wg |access-date=2022-09-01 |publisher=BBC |language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Later life and death==
In March 2013, ''Rolling Stone'' wrote that Rodriguez was suffering from [[glaucoma]] and was going blind. The disease had by then dramatically limited his vision and forced him to walk very slowly and often clutched to someones else's arm. They quoted Rodriguez as saying, “I’m still able to make out some people in the crowd at my shows”.<ref name="auto"/>

In August 2022, ''[[Le Monde]]'' reported that Rodriguez had become blind, and that he was still living in the same house in Detroit.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.lemonde.fr/en/m-le-mag/article/2022/08/29/sitting-down-with-sixto-rodriguez-a-musician-with-a-bittersweet-life_5995106_117.html | title=Sitting down with Sixto Rodriguez, a musician with a bittersweet life | newspaper=Le Monde.fr | date=August 29, 2022 }}</ref>

In February 2023, Rodriguez suffered a stroke, then had surgery in March to repair stroke damage, followed by post-operative physical therapy.<ref>{{Cite web |last=SugarMan.org |date=2023-03-03 |title=RODRIGUEZ RECOVERING WELL AFTER SURGERY |url=https://blog.sugarman.org/2023/03/03/rodriguez-recovering-well-after-surgery/ |access-date=2024-03-09 |website=SugarMan.org |language=en |quote=Rodriguez is well and on the mend after being operated on, following the stroke that he had in February.
