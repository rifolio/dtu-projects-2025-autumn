== History ==
=== Early years (1991–1993) ===
In 1991 as a precursor to P.O.D., [[Sonny Sandoval]] fronted a rap/hip-hop group called Unlicensed Product,<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Sandoval |first=Sonny |title=Son of Southtown |date=2025-02-25 |publisher=[[Baker Books]] |isbn=9781540904423 |pages=69 |language=English}}</ref> while [[Wuv Bernardo]], [[Marcos Curiel]] and Gabe Portillo were in a [[thrash metal]] band called Eschatos, with no vocalist.<ref>{{cite web |last=Anonymous |title=''P.O.D.'' |url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/bands/pod/ |access-date=December 11, 2009 |publisher=San Diego Reader}}</ref>  In 1992, Eschatos recruited Sandoval on vocals, which Bernardo believed would help him with his mother's recent death to [[Leukemia]].  They renamed the group to Payable on Death, a banking-term pitched by Bernardo's girlfriend who worked in a bank at the time.  The name was later shortened to P.O.D.  They recorded their first song that year, "Three In the Power of One", which was later included on their debut studio album ''[[Snuff the Punk]]''.<ref name=":2" />

=== ''Snuff the Punk'' and ''Brown'' (1994–1998) ===
{{main|Snuff the Punk|Brown (P.O.D. album)}}
After recording a demo tape, [[Traa Daniels]] joined the band in 1994 when they needed a bassist for some shows to replace Portillo. P.O.D. signed with [[Rescue Records]], a label created by Bernardo's father, Noah Bernardo Sr., who was also the band's first manager.<ref name="hitquarters2004">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_TimCook_int.html |title=Interview with Tim Cook |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=May 3, 2004 |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref> Between 1994 and 1997, they released three albums under the label, ''[[Snuff the Punk]]'', ''[[Brown (P.O.D. album)|Brown]]'' and ''[[Payable on Death Live]]''.<ref name="P.O.D.

Shortly after the release of ''Payable on Death Live'', [[Essential Records (Christian)|Essential Records]] offered P.O.D. a $100,000 recording contract, but on behalf of the band Sandoval told band manager Tim Cook to decline the offer because, "God has a bigger plan for P.O.D."<ref name="Promotion Crew: P.O.D.

Also in 2002, the band contributed the song "America" to [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s album ''[[Shaman (album)|Shaman]]''.

{{Blockquote|text="I'm a man of faith and I'm a follower and a believer of Jesus Christ, and in talking to these kids, and even in talking to people just throughout my career in P.O.D., a lot of these bands and athletes and all these people that you meet, they don't have a problem with Jesus. They have a problem with people that are religious and claim to know Jesus, but aren't living it or acting it and aren't loving the way Jesus did. [...] We had that song for almost a year, and I didn't take it lightly. I'd been praying on it for over a year. I'd actually took counsel and let people hear it. And it was 50/50. Some people are like, you know what, go for it. Because my heart is like, I don't write music for Christians. I don't write music for people that I believe are saved and going to heaven. [...] Ultimately we're trying to reach people fed up with religion that are sick and tired of it, and people that are in the real world that really are lost and confused."}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/pod/i-am|title=I Am by P.O.D. - Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|accessdate=December 22, 2021}}</ref>

== Musical style and influences ==
The band's name, Payable on Death (P.O.D.), derives itself from the banking term "[[Totten trust|Payable on Death]]". The band chose this name to be a direct tie in with the Christian theology that explains that [[Atonement in Christianity|since Jesus died on the Cross, Christians' debts to God have been paid]]; in other words all believers, in their acceptance that Jesus was sacrificed for them on God's behalf, have inherited eternal life. P.O.D.'s style has evolved over the years, from the [[rap metal]] sound on their early albums to the [[nu metal]] and [[reggae]]-infused [[alternative metal]] styles for which they're most well known.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The band's seventh album, ''[[When Angels & Serpents Dance]]'', is a combination of [[alternative rock]], [[reggae rock]] and Latin-influenced metal with almost none of the rap metal or nu metal sound of their older releases. P.O.D.'s influences include [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Run-DMC]], [[U2]], [[the Police (band)|the Police]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Metallica]], [[AC/DC]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[24-7 Spyz]], and [[Steel Pulse]].{{cn|date=December 2023}}
