'''Modest Mouse''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1993 in [[Issaquah, Washington]], and currently based in [[Portland, Oregon]]. The founding members were lead singer/guitarist [[Isaac Brock (musician)|Isaac Brock]], drummer [[Jeremiah Green]] and bassist [[Eric Judy]]. They achieved critical acclaim for their albums ''[[The Lonesome Crowded West]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Moon & Antarctica]]'' (2000) and found mainstream success with the release of ''[[Good News for People Who Love Bad News]]'' (2004) and its singles "[[Float On (Modest Mouse song)|Float On]]" and "[[Ocean Breathes Salty]]".

From their 1996 debut album ''[[This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About]]'' onwards, the band's lineup mostly centered on Brock and Green, undergoing multiple changes. As of 2024, Brock is the only original member of the band, Green having died in December 2022. Judy performed on every Modest Mouse album until his departure in 2012. Guitarist [[Johnny Marr]] (formerly of [[the Smiths]]) joined the band in 2006, shortly following [[percussion]]ist [[Joe Plummer]] (formerly of [[the Black Heart Procession]]) and multi-instrumentalist [[Tom Peloso]], to work on the album ''[[We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank]]'' (2007). Guitarist [[Jim Fairchild]] joined the band in 2009. The band's sixth album, ''[[Strangers to Ourselves]]'', was released in 2015 and their seventh, ''[[The Golden Casket]]'', in 2021.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years: 1992–1999 ===
When Isaac Brock was a teenager, he was employed at a local family video store just outside Seattle, where he met bassist [[Eric Judy]]. Brock and Judy later discovered drummer [[Jeremiah Green]],<ref name="Carpenter, Susan 2004">Carpenter, Susan. "THE ARTS; POP MUSIC; from Modest Beginnings ...; nearly 15 Years from its Seattle Grunge Origins, Modest Mouse's Career has Taken a Mighty Turn". Los Angeles TimesMar 18 2004. ProQuest. Web. 20 July 2015.</ref> who also resided near Seattle, at a heavy metal show, at which point they decided to make music together. Brock says he made a point of the band being from [[Issaquah]] to avoid association with the music scenes of Seattle or Olympia and to keep with the band's suburban lyrical themes. In 1994, at [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]]'s Dub Narcotic Studios, Modest Mouse recorded its first [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?]]'', which was released by [[K Records]]. This was followed by a single, "[[Broke (Modest Mouse song)|Broke]]", recorded by Steve Wold ({{a.k.a.}} bluesman [[Seasick Steve]]) under [[Sub Pop]] records at Moon Studios in [[Olympia, Washington]]. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been its first album, ''[[Sad Sappy Sucker]]'', but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten. It was not until 2001 that it was officially released. Before the band made its way into the pop music world in 2004, many of Modest Mouse's tours included stops at DIY/punk venues such as [[Speak in Tongues]] in Cleveland, Ohio, where they continued to play even after becoming popular enough to fill larger venues.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sandy |first1=Eric |title=Speak In Tongues: An Oral History of Cleveland's Infamous DIY Punk Venue |date=2022 |publisher=Microcosm Publishing |location=Portland |isbn=9781648410642 |url=https://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/books/29099 |access-date=30 August 2022}}</ref>

After moving to [[Up Records]],<ref>"[http://epitonic.com/artists/modest-mouse/ Modest Mouse]" [bio]. ''[[Epitonic]]''. epitonic.com. Retrieved 2017-05-07.</ref> Modest Mouse released two full-length albums and other recordings including the 1996 LP ''[[This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About]]''. Steve Wold also recorded and produced this album (and at the time was assisting in the recordings as well, but was not officially part of the band) along with the next offering, ''[[Interstate 8 (album)|Interstate 8]]''. The 1997 album, ''[[The Lonesome Crowded West]]'' (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) served as the band's breakthrough. ''The Lonesome Crowded West'' gained the band a [[cult following]], and is now popularly considered to be one of the defining albums of mid-1990s indie rock.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=McMurray|editor-first= Jacob|title=Taking Punk to the Masses: From Nowhere to Nevermind: a Visual History from the Permanent Collection of Experience Music Project|publisher=Fantagraphics Books|location=Seattle|year=2011|isbn=9781606994337|oclc=1065713061}}</ref> During this time, Nick Kraft became involved with the task of refining the band's sound. Prior to its release, the band had recorded the EP ''[[The Fruit That Ate Itself]]''. In 2000, Up Records released a singles and rarities collection entitled ''[[Building Nothing Out of Something]]'' that included the entirety of ''Interstate 8'' except for the songs "Edit the Sad Parts" and "Buttons to Push the Buttons".

=== ''The Moon & Antarctica'': 2000–2002 ===
[[File:TheMoonAntarctica.jpg|thumb|171x171px|[[The Moon & Antarctica]] album cover ]]
In 2000, Modest Mouse released ''[[The Moon & Antarctica]]'', its first album on [[Epic Records]]. The album, produced by [[Califone]]'s Brian Deck during five months of sessions in Chicago,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sentireascoltare.com/artisti/modest-mouse/|title=Modest Mouse biography |publisher=sentireascoltare.com |date=2015-03-01|first=Edoardo|last=Bridda|language=it}}</ref> was met with critical acclaim,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/modestmouse/moonandantarctica |title=Modest Mouse: The Moon & Antarctica (2000): Reviews |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=2009-12-15 |access-date=2011-07-15}}</ref> including a 9.8/10 score from online music magazine [[Pitchfork Media]], despite concerns about releasing material on a major label.<ref>{{cite web|last=DiCrescenzo|first=Brent|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5358-the-moon-antarctica/ |title=Pitchfork: Album Reviews: Modest Mouse: The Moon & Antarctica |publisher=Pitchforkmedia.com |date=2000-06-13 |access-date=2010-09-08}}</ref> The album would later receive further acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.16477 |title=Pitchfork's Top 100 Albums of 2000–2004 |publisher=Listology |access-date=2011-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201213414/http://www.listology.com/sleestak/list/pitchforks-top-100-albums-2000-2004 |archive-date=2014-12-01}}</ref>

The band licensed "Gravity Rides Everything" for a [[Nissan Quest]] [[minivan]] advertisement, a move that Brock has publicly acknowledged as blatantly commercial but necessary to achieve financial stability. Regarding the commercial, Brock stated, "People who don't have to make their living playing music can bitch about my principles while they spend their parents' money or wash dishes for some asshole."<ref>{{cite web|last=Modell |first=Josh |url=https://avclub.com/content/node/23015 |title=Modest Mouse |publisher=The A.V.

In 2001, Modest Mouse released the EP ''[[Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks]]'', a collection of unused songs from the recording sessions of ''The Moon & Antarctica''. In 2002, the band joined [[Cake (band)|Cake]], [[De La Soul]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[The Hackensaw Boys]] and [[Kinky (band)|Kinky]] on the [[Unlimited Sunshine Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Mirkin|first=Steven|url=https://variety.com/2002/music/reviews/unlimited-sunshine-tour-1200546853/|title=Unlimited Sunshine Tour|website=Variety.com|date=13 August 2002|access-date=26 June 2021}}</ref>

Drummer [[Benjamin Weikel]] joined the band, replacing Green, along with [[The Murder City Devils|Murder City Devils]] guitarist [[Dann Gallucci]], who had previously played with Modest Mouse. Prior to starting the band's writing and recording process, Brock was devastated by the loss of "a couple of the most important people in my life", he said.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carpenter|first=Susan|date=2004-03-18|title=From Modest beginnings ...|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-mar-18-wk-pop18-story.html|access-date=2020-07-20|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> Following these events, the band released their fourth album, ''[[Good News for People Who Love Bad News]]'', on April 6, 2004.

In an interview in 2022, celebrating 15 years of ''We Were Dead before The Ship Even Sank'', Isaac Brock and Johnny Marr revealed that they were writing songs together again, the first of which is called "Rivers of Rivers". The writing took place in a "pen pal" kind of way, with Brock saying that there were more songs to be developed in 2022 together "once the world tilts back on its axis".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clarke |first1=Patrick |title=Johnny Marr and Modest Mouse have been writing new music together |url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/johnny-marr-and-modest-mouse-have-been-writing-new-music-together-3188108 |website=NME |date=22 March 2022 |publisher=BandLab Technologies |access-date=4 May 2022}}</ref>

In April 2024, Brock announced that he was planning on reuniting the band's 2004 line-up which recorded ''[[Good News for People Who Love Bad News]]'' for a tour in celebration of the record.

The band co-headlined with The Flaming Lips for an "It's Summertime" tour in August and September of 2025.

==Musical style and lyrics==
Marcy Donelson of [[AllMusic]] called Modest Mouse's sound "a volatile mix of [[Punk rock|punk]]-inspired rawness and simmering atmosphere" showing tendencies of "light-hearted [[Pop music|pop]]". The band's early releases were said to be a mix of [[emo]], [[post-rock]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[progressive music]].<ref name=":0" /> The early releases were also noted for their abrasiveness and sense of experimentation. Jim Alexander of ''[[NME]]'' wrote in a contemporary review of ''[[The Lonesome Crowded West]]'': "Modest Mouse are the sound of the [[Pacific Northwest]] - this is music as rugged as the area it comes from." The band's later output contained pop sensibilities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=NME.COM - MODEST MOUSE - The Lonesome Crowded West - 4 January 1999 |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990004110452reviews.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001008234635/http://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews/19990004110452reviews.html |archive-date=2000-10-08 |access-date=2025-06-21 |website=www.nme.com}}</ref>

Frontman [[Isaac Brock (musician)|Isaac Brock]]'s lyrical themes tend to explore topics such as small town life and [[religion]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web |last1=Donelson |first1=Marcy |title=Modest Mouse Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & Mor |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/modest-mouse-mn0000480086#biography |website=AllMusic}}</ref> In 2016, a study conducted by music data company [[Musixmatch]] surveyed 43,414 songs spanning multiple genres found that Modest Mouse was one of the most profane bands among the subjects categorized as "indie rock," second only to [[The Neighbourhood|The Neighborhood]]. It was estimated that the band used profanity every 310 words, and that the top three swear words uttered by the band were "[[shit]]," "[[fuck]]" and "[[Ass (slang)|ass]]," respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Study: These Are the Most Profane Bands in Metal and Rock |url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/study_these_are_the_most_profane_bands_in_metal_and_rock.html |access-date=2025-08-03 |website=www.ultimate-guitar.com |language=en}}</ref>
