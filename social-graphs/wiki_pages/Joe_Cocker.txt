'''John Robert''' "'''Joe'''" '''Cocker''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE}} (20 May 1944 – 22 December 2014) was an English singer known for his gritty, bluesy voice and dynamic stage performances featuring expressive body movements.  Most of his best-known singles, such as 
"[[Feelin' Alright?]]" and "[[Unchain My Heart (song)|Unchain My Heart]]", were recordings of songs written by other songwriters, though he composed a number of songs for most of his albums as well, often in conjunction with songwriting partner [[Chris Stainton]].<ref name="Indep23dec14"/>

Cocker's [[With a Little Help from My Friends (Joe Cocker album)|first album]] featured a recording of [[the Beatles]]' "[[With a Little Help from My Friends#Joe Cocker version|With a Little Help from My Friends]]", which brought him to near-instant stardom. The song reached number one in the UK in 1968, became a staple of his many live shows ([[Woodstock]] and the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight]] in 1969, the [[Party at the Palace]] in 2002) and was also known as the theme song for the late 1980s American TV series ''[[The Wonder Years]]''. He continued his success with his [[Joe Cocker!|second album]], which included a second Beatles song, "[[She Came In Through the Bathroom Window]]". A hastily thrown together 1970 US tour led to the live double-album ''[[Mad Dogs & Englishmen (album)|Mad Dogs & Englishmen]]'', which featured an all-star band organized by [[Leon Russell]].  His 1974 recording of "[[You Are So Beautiful]]" reached number five in the US, and became his [[signature song]].  Cocker's best-selling song was the US number one "[[Up Where We Belong]]", a duet with [[Jennifer Warnes]] that earned a 1983 [[Grammy Award]]. He released a total of 22 studio albums over a 43-year recording career.

In 1993, Cocker was nominated for the [[Brit Award]] for Best British Male Solo Artist. He was awarded a bronze [[Sheffield Legends]] plaque in his hometown in 2007, and received an [[OBE]] the following year for services to music.<ref name="Brits" /><ref name="OBE" /> He was ranked number 97 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s 100 greatest singers list.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231 |title=100 Greatest Singers |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=27 November 2008 |access-date=11 April 2012 |archive-date=29 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429022814/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was selected for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2025.<ref name="rr25">{{cite web |title=The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation unveils electrifying class of 2025 inductees |url=https://rockhall.com/press-release/the-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-foundation-unveils-electrifying-class-of-2025-inductees/ |website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame |access-date=28 April 2025}}</ref>

== Early life (1944–1960) ==
[[File:Sheffield Legends Joe Cocker.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sheffield Legends]] plaque in Cocker's home city of [[Sheffield]], England]]
Cocker was born on 20 May 1944 at 38 Tasker Road, [[Crookes]], [[Sheffield]]. He was the youngest son of a civil servant, Harold Norman Cocker (1907–2001), at the time of his son's birth serving as an [[aircraftman]] in the [[Royal Air Force]], and Madge (née Lee).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-108196|isbn=978-0-19-861412-8|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.013.108196|chapter=Cocker, John Robert &#91;Joe&#93; (1944–2014), singer|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2018|last1=Leigh|first1=Spencer}}</ref> According to differing family stories, Cocker received his nickname of Joe either from playing a childhood game called "Cowboy Joe", or from a local window cleaner named Joe.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Adams |first=Rob |date=December 24, 2014 |title=Joe Cocker |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13194754.joe-cocker/ |access-date=January 20, 2025 |website=The Herald}}</ref>

Cocker's main musical influences growing up were [[Ray Charles]] and [[Lonnie Donegan]]. Cocker's first experience singing in public was at age 12 when his elder brother Victor invited him on stage to sing during a gig of his [[skiffle]] group. In 1960, along with three friends, Cocker formed his first group, the Cavaliers. For the group's first performance at a youth club, they were required to pay the price of admission before entering. The Cavaliers eventually broke up after a year and Cocker left school to become an apprentice [[gasfitter]] working for the [[East Midlands Gas Board]], later [[British Gas Corporation]], while simultaneously pursuing a career in music.{{sfn|Bean|2003|pp=6–9}}

Cocker is not related to fellow Sheffield-born musician [[Jarvis Cocker]], despite a rumour to this effect (particularly in Australia, where Jarvis Cocker's father, radio presenter [[Mac Cocker]], allowed listeners to believe that he was Joe's brother),<ref>{{cite news |first=Lynn |last=Barber |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/10/popandrock.meltdownfestival2007 |title=Paris match |work=The Guardian |date=10 June 2007 |access-date=26 March 2013 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Will |last=Hodgkinson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/19/jarvis-cocker-soundtrack-of-my-life |title=Soundtrack of my life: Jarvis Cocker |work=The Guardian |date= 19 April 2009 |access-date=26 March 2013 |location=London}}</ref> although Joe was a friend of the family and even did some babysitting for Jarvis when the latter was an infant.<ref name="clashmusic">{{cite web |title=Ten Things You Never Knew About...

==Career (1961-2014)==
=== Early career and the Grease Band (1961–1969) ===
In 1961, under the stage name "Vance Arnold", Cocker started a new group, Vance Arnold and the Avengers.<ref name="Story" /> The name was a combination of Vince Everett ([[Elvis Presley]]'s character in ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'', which Cocker misheard as Vance) and country singer [[Eddy Arnold]].{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=16}} The group mostly played in the [[pub]]s of Sheffield,<ref name="Story">{{cite web |url=http://www.cocker.com/Story1.html |title=The Story-Part One:On the runway to fame |publisher=cocker.com |access-date=10 December 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080730171247/http://www.cocker.com/Story1.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 30 July 2008}}</ref> performing [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Ray Charles]] songs. Cocker developed an interest in [[blues]] music and sought out recordings by [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Lightnin' Hopkins]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]].<ref name="Hale">{{cite book |first=Don |last=Hale |title=Sounds of the 60s |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rj5pYWRzoe8C&pg=PA33 |publisher=Don Hale |isbn=978-1-907163-22-7 |pages=33–}}</ref> In 1963, they booked their first significant gig when they supported [[the Rolling Stones]] at [[Sheffield City Hall]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/22/joe-cocker-dies-grammy-winning-sheffield-singer theguardian.com]; "Joe Cocker, Grammy Award-winning singer dies at age of 70". Retrieved 23 December 2014</ref>

In 1964, Cocker signed a recording contract as a solo act with [[Decca Records|Decca]] and released his first single, a recording of [[the Beatles]]' "[[I'll Cry Instead]]" (with [[Big Jim Sullivan]] and [[Jimmy Page]] playing guitars). Despite extensive promotion from Decca lauding his youth and working-class roots, the record was a flop and his recording contract with Decca lapsed at the end of 1964.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=28}} After Cocker recorded the single, he dropped his stage name and formed a new group, Joe Cocker's Blues Band. There is only one known recording of Joe Cocker's Blues Band on an EP given out by [[The Sheffield College]] during Rag Week and called ''Rag Goes Mad at the Mojo''.<ref>[http://www.newsguardian.co.uk/news/local/back-in-the-summer-of-love-with-a-little-help-from-my-friends-1-1588188 "Back in the Summer of Love, with a little help from my friends ..."] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228022619/http://www.newsguardian.co.uk/news/local/back-in-the-summer-of-love-with-a-little-help-from-my-friends-1-1588188 |date=28 December 2014 }}. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 22 December 2014</ref>

In 1966, after a year-long hiatus from music, Cocker teamed up with [[Chris Stainton]], whom he had met several years before, to form [[the Grease Band]].<ref name="Story" /> The Grease Band was named after Cocker read an interview with jazz keyboardist [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]], where Smith positively described another musician as "having a lot of grease". Like the Avengers, Cocker's group mostly played in pubs in and around Sheffield. The Grease Band came to the attention of [[Denny Cordell]], the producer of [[Procol Harum]], [[the Moody Blues]] and [[Georgie Fame]]. Cocker recorded the single "Marjorine" without the Grease Band for Cordell in a London studio. He then moved to London with Chris Stainton, and the Grease Band was dissolved. Cordell set Cocker up with a residency at the [[Marquee Club]] in London, and a "new" Grease Band was formed with Stainton and keyboardist [[Tommy Eyre]].{{sfn|Bean|2003|pp=43–45}}

In 1968, Cocker found commercial success with a rearrangement of "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]", another Beatles song, which, many years later, was used as the opening theme for ''[[The Wonder Years]]''. The recording features lead guitar from [[Jimmy Page]], drumming by [[B. J. Wilson]], backing vocals from [[Sue and Sunny]], and Tommy Eyre on organ. The single remained in the top ten of the [[UK singles chart]] for thirteen weeks before eventually reaching number one, on 9 November 1968.{{sfn|Bean|2003|pp=48–49}} It also reached number 68 on the US charts.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=54}}

The new touring line-up of Cocker's Grease Band featured [[Henry McCullough]] on lead guitar, who would go on to briefly play with McCartney's [[Wings (band)|Wings]]. After touring the UK with [[the Who]] in autumn 1968<ref>{{Cite book|title= Anyway Anyhow Anywhere |last1= Neill |first1= Andrew |last2= Kent|first2= Matt |year= 2005|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |isbn= 1-4027-2838-7 |page= 146 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=e1a1C_somjIC}}</ref> and [[Gene Pitney]] and [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]] in early winter 1969, the Grease Band embarked on their first tour of the US in spring 1969. Cocker's album ''[[With a Little Help from My Friends (Joe Cocker album)|With a Little Help from My Friends]]'' was released soon after their arrival and made number 35 on the American charts, eventually going gold.{{sfn|Bean|2003|pp=54–55}}

[[File:Woodstock redmond cocker01.jpg|thumb|Cocker at [[Woodstock]] (1969)]]
During his US tour, Cocker played at several large festivals, including the [[Newport Pop Festival|Newport Rock Festival]] and the [[Denver Pop Festival]]. In August, Denny Cordell heard about the planned concert in [[Woodstock, New York]] and convinced organiser [[Artie Kornfeld]] to book Cocker and the Grease Band for the [[Woodstock]] Festival. The group had to be flown into the festival by helicopter due to the large crowds. They performed several songs, including "[[Feelin' Alright?]]", "Something's Comin' On", "[[Let's Go Get Stoned]]", "[[I Shall Be Released]]" and "With a Little Help from My Friends". Cocker would later say that the experience was "like an eclipse&nbsp;... it was a very special day."{{sfn|Bean|2003|pp=58–60}}

Directly after Woodstock, Cocker released his second album, ''[[Joe Cocker!]]'' Impressed by his version of "With a Little Help from My Friends", [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] allowed Cocker to use their songs "[[She Came In Through the Bathroom Window]]" and "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" for the album.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=61}} Recorded during a break in touring in the spring and summer, the album reached number 11 on the US charts and garnered a second UK [[Chart hit|hit]] with the [[Leon Russell]] song, "[[Delta Lady]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

In August 1969, Cocker performed at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight Festival]] at [[Wootton Bridge]], Isle of Wight, England.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/hampshire/content/articles/2005/04/08/iowfestival_history_feature.shtml "Isle of Wight Festival.- History"]. BBC. Retrieved 22 December 2014</ref> Throughout 1969 he was featured on variety TV shows like ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[This Is Tom Jones]]''. Onstage, he exhibited an idiosyncratic physical intensity, flailing his arms and playing [[air guitar]]. At the end of the year Cocker was unwilling to embark on another US tour, so he dissolved the Grease Band.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

=== Mad Dogs & Englishmen (1970–1971) ===
[[File:Joe Cocker 72.jpg|thumb|left|Cocker in concert at Palasport, Rome, July 1972]]
Despite Cocker's reluctance to venture out on the road again, an American tour had already been booked so he had to quickly form a new band in order to fulfill his contractual obligations. It proved to be a large group of more than 20 musicians, including pianist and bandleader Leon Russell, three drummers – [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], [[Jim Keltner]], and Chuck Blackwell, and backing vocalists [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Claudia Lennear]]. Denny Cordell christened the new band "Mad Dogs & Englishmen", after the [[Mad Dogs and Englishmen (song)|Noël Coward song of the same name]] (with its refrain, "Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun"). Cocker's music evolved into a more bluesy type of rock, comparable to that of the Rolling Stones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/joe-cocker-dies-of-lung-cancer-at-70/78688/ |title=Joe Cocker Dies Of Lung Cancer At 70 |publisher=www.prefixmag.com |date=22 December 2014 |access-date=23 December 2014}}</ref>

During the ensuing Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour (later described by drummer Jim Keltner as "a big, wild party"),{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=70}} Cocker toured 48 cities, recorded a live album, and received positive reviews from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' for his performances, but the pace of the tour was exhausting. Russell and Cocker had personal problems; Cocker became depressed and began drinking excessively as the tour wound down in May 1970. Meanwhile, he enjoyed several chart entries in the United States with cover versions of "[[Feelin' Alright?|Feelin' Alright]]" (originally recorded by [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]]) and "[[Cry Me a River (1953 song)|Cry Me a River]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

His version of [[the Box Tops]]' hit "[[The Letter (Box Tops song)|The Letter]]", which appeared on the live album and film, ''[[Mad Dogs & Englishmen (album)|Mad Dogs & Englishmen]]'', became his first US Top Ten [[hit record|hit]]. After spending several months in Los Angeles, Cocker returned home to Sheffield, where his family became increasingly concerned with his deteriorating physical and [[mental health]]. In the summer of 1971, [[A&M Records]] released the single "High Time We Went". This became a hit, reaching number 22 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, but was not issued on an album until November 1972 on the ''[[Joe Cocker (1972 album)|Joe Cocker]]'' album.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

=== On the road (1972–1979) ===
In early 1972, after nearly two years away from music, Cocker went on tour with a group that Chris Stainton had formed. He opened with a performance in [[Madison Square Garden]] which was attended by about 20,000 people. After touring the United States, he embarked on a European tour where he played to large audiences in [[Milan]] and Germany. He then returned to the United States for another tour in autumn 1972. During these tours the group cut the songs that would be part of his newest album, ''[[Joe Cocker (album)|Joe Cocker]]''. A mixture of live songs and studio recordings, the album peaked at number 30 on the US charts.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=96}}

In October 1972, when Cocker toured Australia, he and six members of his entourage were arrested in [[Adelaide]] for possession of [[marijuana]].<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=anh&AN=200210101022405517&site=ehost-live&scope=site |title = Joe's back – and not looking for trouble |last = Williams |first = Nadine |date = 10 October 2002 |access-date = 13 January 2016 |newspaper = The Advertiser (Adelaide) |page = 22 |publisher = News Ltd. |edition = State |location = Adelaide, South Australia |id = EBSCO Host Accession Number: 200210101022405517}}</ref> The next day, in [[Melbourne]], assault charges were laid after a brawl at the Commodore Chateau Hotel,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MfgKAAAAIBAJ&pg=5586,5519884&dq=joe+cocker+commodore+chateau |title=Joe Cocker |access-date=27 December 2008 |date=15 October 1972 |work=Prescott Courier }}{{Dead link |date=March 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[Australian Federal Police]] gave Cocker 48 hours to leave the country. This caused huge public outcry in Australia, as Cocker was a high-profile overseas artist and had a strong support base, especially among the [[baby boomers]] who were coming of age and able to vote for the first time. It sparked hefty debate about the use and legalisation of marijuana in Australia, and gained Cocker the nickname "the Mad Dog".{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=101}}

Shortly after the Australian tour, Stainton retired from his music career to establish his own recording studio. After his friend's departure and his estrangement from his longtime producer Denny Cordell, Cocker sank into depression and began using heroin. In June 1973, he kicked the habit but continued to drink heavily.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=110}}

At the end of 1973, Cocker returned to the studio to record a new album, ''[[I Can Stand a Little Rain]]''. The album, released in August 1974, was number 11 on the US charts and one single, a recording of [[Billy Preston]]'s "[[You Are So Beautiful]]", reached the number 5 slot.{{sfn|Bean|2003|pp=112–14}} Despite positive reviews for the album, Cocker struggled with live performances, largely due to his problems with alcohol. One such instance was reported in a 1974 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', which said that during two [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] performances in October of that year he threw up onstage.<ref>''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine — "Random Notes" — 21 November 1974, page 13</ref>

In January 1975, he released a second album that had been recorded at the same time as ''I Can Stand a Little Rain'', ''[[Jamaica Say You Will]]''. To promote his new album, Cocker embarked on another tour of Australia, made possible by the country's new [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government. In late 1975, he contributed vocals on a number of the tracks on [[Bo Diddley]]'s ''The 20th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll'' all-star album. He also recorded a new album in a [[Kingston, Jamaica]] studio, ''[[Stingray (album)|Stingray]]'', but record sales were disappointing with the album only reaching number 70 on the US charts.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=122}}

In May 1976, Cocker headlined an 11-date tour of Canada, and on 2 October, Cocker performed "Feelin' Alright" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. [[John Belushi]] joined him onstage doing his famous impersonation of Cocker's stage movements. At the time, Cocker was $800,000 in debt to [[A&M Records]] and struggling with alcoholism. Several months later, he met producer [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]], who agreed to manage him on the condition that he stay sober. With a new band, Cocker embarked on a tour of New Zealand, Australia and South America. He then recorded a new album with [[Session musician|session]] work by [[Steve Gadd]] and [[Chuck Rainey]]. In the autumn of 1978, Cocker toured North America promoting his album, ''[[Luxury You Can Afford]]''. Despite this effort, it received mixed reviews, selling around 300,000 copies.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=140}}

In 1979, Cocker joined the "Woodstock in Europe" tour, which featured musicians like [[Arlo Guthrie]] and [[Richie Havens]] who had played at the 1969 Woodstock Festival. He also performed in New York's [[Central Park]] to an audience of 20,000 people. The concert was recorded and released as the live album, ''Live in New York''.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=143}}

=== 1980s (1980-1989) ===
In 1982, Cocker recorded two songs with the jazz group [[The Crusaders (Houston group)|the Crusaders]] on their album ''[[Standing Tall (The Crusaders album)|Standing Tall]]''. One song, "I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today", was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] and Cocker performed it with the Crusaders at the awards ceremony. The Crusaders wrote this song with Cocker in mind to sing it. Cocker then released a new reggae-influenced album, ''[[Sheffield Steel]]'', recorded with the [[Compass Point All Stars]], produced by [[Chris Blackwell]] and [[Alex Sadkin]].{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

Also in 1982, Cocker recorded the duet "[[Up Where We Belong]]" with [[Jennifer Warnes]] for the soundtrack of the film ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]''. The song was an international hit, reaching number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and winning a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo]]. The duet also won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], and Cocker and Warnes performed the song at the awards ceremony.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wiley|first=Mason|title=Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards|year=1996| publisher=Ballantine Books| location=New York|isbn=0-345-40053-4|page=623|edition=5|author2=Damien Bona}}</ref> Several days later, he was invited to perform "[[You Are So Beautiful]]" with [[Ray Charles]] in a television tribute to the musician. In 1983, Cocker joined a star-studded line-up of British musicians, including [[Jimmy Page]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Bill Wyman]] for singer [[Ronnie Lane]]'s [[ARMS Charity Concerts|1983 tour]] to raise money for the London-based organisation [[Action for Research into Multiple Sclerosis]], in particular because Lane was beginning to suffer from the degenerative disease.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/01/16/jeff-beck-opens-up-about-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-gigs-with-clapton-jeff-beck-group-reunion-prospects/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118203015/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/01/16/jeff-beck-opens-up-about-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-gigs-with-clapton-jeff-beck-group-reunion-prospects/|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 January 2009|title=Jeff Beck Opens Up About Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Gigs with Clapton Jeff Beck Group Reunion Prospects|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=26 December 2014}}</ref>

While on another tour that year, Cocker was arrested by Austrian police after refusing to perform because of inadequate sound equipment. The charges were eventually dropped and Cocker was released.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=160}} Shortly after the incident, he released his ninth studio album, ''[[Civilized Man]]''. His next album ''[[Cocker (album)|Cocker]]'' was dedicated to his mother, Madge, who died when he was recording in the studio with producer [[Terry Manning]]. A track from the album, "[[You Can Leave Your Hat On]]" was featured in the 1986 film ''[[9½ Weeks]]''. The album eventually went Platinum on the European charts.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=167}} His song "Love Lives On" was featured in the 1987 film ''[[Harry and the Hendersons]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIRzS4ZD1zY |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211029/AIRzS4ZD1zY |archive-date=2021-10-29 |title=Joe Cocker - Love Lives On (Remastered Movie Version) |date=7 March 2013 |access-date=20 August 2021 |via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> His 1987 album ''[[Unchain My Heart (album)|Unchain My Heart]]'' was nominated for a Grammy Award, although it did not win. ''[[One Night of Sin]]'' was also a commercial success, surpassing ''Unchain My Heart'' in sales and yielding his final Top 20 hit in the United States, "When The Night Comes", written by [[Bryan Adams]], [[Jim Vallance]] and [[Diane Warren]] that peaked at number 11 in January 1990.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}}

Throughout the 1980s, Cocker continued to tour around the world, playing to large audiences in Europe, Australia and the United States. In 1986, he met the Italian singer [[Zucchero Fornaciari]], who dedicated a song (''Nuovo, meraviglioso amico'', in ''Rispetto'') to the English bluesman. After that Cocker took part in some concerts of the promotional tours for the albums ''[[Blue's]]'' (1987) and ''[[Oro Incenso & Birra]]'' (1989). In 1988, he performed at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] and appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=178}} After [[Barclay James Harvest]] and [[Bob Dylan]], Cocker was the first to give rock concerts in the [[German Democratic Republic]], in [[East Berlin]] and [[Dresden]]. The venue, the ''Blüherwiese'', next to the [[Glücksgas Stadium|Rudolf–Harbig–Stadion]], bears the vernacular name ''Cockerwiese'' ('Cocker meadow') today.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/51.04429/13.75040 |title=OpenStreetMap |website=OpenStreetMap |access-date=25 January 2018}}</ref> He also performed for US President [[George H.

In 1963, Cocker began dating Eileen Webster, also a resident of Sheffield. The couple dated intermittently for the next 13 years.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=15}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Joe Cocker |url=https://en.24smi.org/celebrity/55167-joe-cocker.html |access-date=2021-01-11 |website=en.24smi.org |language=en}}</ref>

In 1978, Cocker moved onto a ranch owned by [[Jane Fonda]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. Pam Baker, a local summer camp director and fan of Cocker's music, had persuaded the actress to lend the house to Cocker. Baker began dating Cocker, and they married on 11 October 1987.{{sfn|Bean|2003|p=171}}
