'''Blur''' a<!-- This article is written in British English, which commonly treats collective nouns plural. Do not change "are" to "is". -->re an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1988, consisting of singer [[Damon Albarn]], guitarist [[Graham Coxon]], bassist [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]], and drummer [[Dave Rowntree]]. Their debut album, ''[[Leisure (album)|Leisure]]'' (1991), incorporated the sounds of [[Madchester]] and [[shoegaze]]. Following a stylistic change influenced by British [[guitar pop]] groups such as [[the Kinks]], [[the Beatles]], and [[XTC]], Blur released the albums ''[[Modern Life Is Rubbish]]'' (1993), ''[[Parklife]]'' (1994), and ''[[The Great Escape (Blur album)|The Great Escape]]'' (1995). The single "[[Girls & Boys (Blur song)|Girls & Boys]]" (1994) became a hit in the UK and the US, respectively peaking at number 5 on the [[UK singles chart]] and number 59 on the ''[[Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]]. As a result, the band helped to popularise the [[Britpop]] genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a widely publicised chart battle with rival band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] in 1995 dubbed "[[Britpop#"The Battle of Britpop"|the Battle of Britpop]]". 
 
Blur's [[Blur (Blur album)|self-titled fifth album]] (1997) saw another stylistic shift, influenced by the [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] styles of American [[indie rock]] groups, and became their third UK chart-topping album. "[[Song 2]]" became popular on alternative radio in the US. Their next album, ''[[13 (Blur album)|13]]'' (1999), saw the band experimenting with [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[art rock]] styles, and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn and Coxon. Their seventh album, ''[[Think Tank (Blur album)|Think Tank]]'' (2003), continued their experimentation with electronic sounds and was shaped by Albarn's growing interest in [[world music]], featuring more minimal guitar work. Coxon left the band early in the sessions for ''Think Tank'', and Blur disbanded for several years after the album's tour in 2003.

In 2009, Blur reunited with Coxon and embarked on a European reunion tour. In the following years, they released several singles and compilations and toured internationally. In 2012, they received the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for [[2012 Brit Awards|Outstanding Contribution to Music]]. Their eighth album, ''[[The Magic Whip]]'' (2015), was their first in twelve years and the sixth consecutive Blur studio album to top the British charts. After the ''Magic Whip'' tour, Blur went on hiatus until the release of their ninth album, ''[[The Ballad of Darren]]'', in 2023.

==History==
===Formation and ''Leisure'' (1988–1991)===
[[File:Blur (Logo).png|thumb|After their original name, Seymour, was rejected by [[Food Records]], the band chose Blur from a list of alternatives the label drew up.]]

Blur were formed in December 1988 when bassist Alex James joined Damon Albarn's band, Circus, and they changed the name to Seymour after [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[Seymour: An Introduction]]''.<ref name="Thompson209" /><ref>Harris, 2004, p. 46</ref> Already in the band were drummer Dave Rowntree, who had joined in October,<ref name="Thompson209">Thompson, 2004, p. 209</ref> and guitarist Graham Coxon, Albarn's childhood friend from [[Essex]], who was studying at the [[University of London]]'s [[Goldsmiths College]] along with Albarn and James.<ref name="Thompson209" /><ref>Harris, 2004, p. 45</ref> The group performed live for the first time in summer 1989 in the goods shed of the [[East Anglian Railway Museum]] at [[Chappel & Wakes Colne]].<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 47</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=Matt|last=Plummer|url=https://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/18935679.colchester-heroes-blur-played-homecoming-gig-wakes-colne/|title=The night Britpop legends Blur went back to the scene of first-ever concert|website=Gazette|date=11 December 2020|access-date=9 June 2022|language=en}}</ref> In November, [[Food Records]]' [[A&R]] representative [[Andy Ross (music executive)|Andy Ross]] attended a Seymour performance that convinced him to court the group for his label. After this he brought label founder [[David Balfe]] to a couple more, including a particularly packed gig at [[The Falcon, Camden]].<ref name="The Last Party">{{cite book|url=https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Last_Party/mI0wAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=seymour+blur+food+records+camden+falcon&dq=seymour+blur+food+records+camden+falcon&printsec=frontcover|title=The Last Party: Britpop, Blair and the Demise of English Rock|first=John|last=Harris|publisher=[[Fourth Estate]]|isbn=9780007134724|year=2003|page=50}}</ref> The only concern held by Ross and Food was that they disliked the band's name. Food drew up a list of alternatives, from which the group decided on Blur. Food Records finally signed the rechristened band in March 1990.<ref>Harris, 2004, pp. 49–50</ref>

From March to July 1990, Blur toured Britain, opening for [[the Cramps]], and testing out new songs. In October 1990, after their tour was over, Blur released the single "[[She's So High (Blur song)|She's So High]]", which reached number 48 in the [[UK singles chart]].<ref name="Strong">Strong, 2003, pp. 635–636</ref> The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, but they made progress when paired with producer [[Stephen Street]]. The resulting single release, "[[There's No Other Way]]", became a hit, peaking at number eight.<ref>Harris, 2004, pp. 53–55</ref> As a result of the single's success, Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented the Syndrome club in London dubbed "[[The Scene That Celebrates Itself]]".<ref>Harris, 2004, pp. 56–57</ref> ''[[NME]]'' magazine wrote in 1991, "[Blur] are [the] acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started to run out of steam."<ref>Kelly, Danny. "Sacre Blur!" ''NME''. 20 July 1991.</ref>

The band's third single, "[[Bang (Blur song)|Bang]]", performed relatively disappointingly, reaching only number 24.<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 58</ref> Andy Ross and Food owner [[David Balfe]] were convinced Blur's best course of action was to continue drawing influence from the [[Madchester]] genre. Blur attempted to expand their musical sound, but the recording of the group's debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio. Although the resulting album ''[[Leisure (album)|Leisure]]'' (1991) peaked at number seven on the [[UK Albums Chart]], it received mixed reviews,<ref name="Strong" /> and according to journalist [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]], "could not shake off the odour of anti-climax".<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 59</ref>

===Britpop years (1992–1995)===

After discovering they were £60,000  in debt, Blur toured the United States in 1992 in an attempt to recoup their financial losses.<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 66</ref> The group released the single "[[Popscene]]" to coincide with the start of the tour. Featuring "a rush of punk guitars, '60s pop hooks, blaring British horns, controlled fury, and postmodern humor",<ref>{{cite web|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/pop-scene-mt0012008673|title=Popscene' song review|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=16 June 2008}}</ref> "Popscene" was a turning point for the band musically.<ref>Harris, 2004, pp. 67, 77</ref> However, upon its release it only charted at number 32. "We felt 'Popscene' was a big departure; a very, very English record", Albarn told the ''NME'' in 1993, "But that annoyed a lot of people ... We put ourselves out on a limb to pursue this English ideal and no-one was interested."<ref name="shite">Harris, John. "A shite sports car and a punk reincarnation". ''NME''. 10 April 1993.</ref> As a result of the single's lacklustre performance, plans to release a single named "Never Clever" were scrapped and work on Blur's second album was pushed back.<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 68</ref>

During the two-month American tour, the band became increasingly unhappy, often venting frustrations on each other, leading to several physical confrontations.<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 73</ref> The band members were homesick; Albarn said, "I just started to miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so I started writing songs which created an English atmosphere."<ref name="shite" /> Upon the group's return to Britain, Blur (Albarn in particular) were upset by the success rival group [[Suede (band)|Suede]] had achieved while they were gone.<ref>Harris, 2004, pp. 73–75</ref> After a poor performance at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received set by Suede on the same bill, Blur were in danger of being dropped by Food.<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 78</ref> By that time, Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their British heritage in contrast to the popularity of American [[grunge]] bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 79</ref> Although sceptical of Albarn's new manifesto for Blur, Balfe gave assent for the band's choice of [[Andy Partridge]] (of [[XTC]]) to produce their follow-up to ''Leisure''. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 82</ref>

Blur completed their second album ''[[Modern Life Is Rubbish]]'' in December 1992, but Food Records said the album required more potential hit singles and asked them to return to the studio for a second time. The band complied and Albarn wrote "[[For Tomorrow (song)|For Tomorrow]]", which became the album's lead single.<ref>Harris, 2004, pp. 82–83</ref> "For Tomorrow" was a minor success, reaching number 28 on the charts.<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 90</ref> ''Modern Life Is Rubbish'' was released in May 1993. The announcement of the album's release included a press photo which featured Blur, dressed in a mix of [[Mod (subculture)#Fashion|mod]] and [[skinhead]] attire, posing alongside a [[English Mastiff|mastiff]] with the words "British Image 1" spraypainted behind them. At the time, such imagery was viewed as nationalistic and racially insensitive by the British music press; to quieten concerns, Blur released the "British Image 2" photo, which was "a camp restaging of a pre-war aristocratic tea party".<ref>Harris, 2004, pp. 88–89</ref> ''Modern Life Is Rubbish'' peaked at number 15 on the British charts,<ref name="UKChart">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/blur/|title=Blur Single & Album Chart History|work=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=9 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022195217/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/blur/|archive-date=22 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> but failed to break into the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling only 19,000 copies there.<ref>Duffy, Tom.

The success of ''[[Parklife]]'' (1994) revived Blur's commercial fortunes. The album's first single, the disco-influenced "[[Girls & Boys (Blur song)|Girls & Boys]]", found favour on [[BBC Radio 1]] and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart,<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 141</ref> and number 59 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] where it remains the band's highest-charting single.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/blur/chart-history/hsi/|title=Blur: Billboard Hot 100 chart history|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=10 June 2022}}</ref> ''Parklife'' entered the British charts at number one and stayed on the album charts for 90 weeks.<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 142</ref> Enthusiastically greeted by the music press—the ''NME'' called it "a Great Pop Record ... bigger, bolder, narkier and funnier [than ''Modern Life is Rubbish'']"—''Parklife'' is regarded as one of Britpop's defining records.<ref>Dee, John.

"Graham Coxon interview". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. May 1999.</ref>

Blur began working on their fourth album ''[[The Great Escape (Blur album)|The Great Escape]]'' at the start of 1995.<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 222</ref> Building upon the band's previous two albums, Albarn's lyrics for the album consisted of several third-person narratives. James reflected, "It was all more elaborate, more orchestral, more theatrical, and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional, misfit characters fucking up."<ref>Harris, 2004, pp. 223–24</ref> The release of the album's lead single "[[Country House (Blur song)|Country House]]" played a part in Blur's public rivalry with Manchester band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] termed the [[The Battle of Britpop|"Battle of Britpop"]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/blur-beat-oasis-in-chart-battle/|title=When Blur beat Oasis in the battle of Britpop|work=The Telegraph|date=26 August 2016|access-date=9 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308135725/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/blur-beat-oasis-in-chart-battle/|archive-date=8 March 2021|url-access=subscription|url-status=live}}</ref> Partly due to increasing antagonisms between the groups, Blur and Oasis released their new singles on the same day, an event the ''NME'' called "The British Heavyweight Championship". The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon, and Albarn appeared on the ''[[ITV News at Ten|News at Ten]]''.<ref name=liveforever>''Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop''. Passion Pictures, 2004.</ref> At the end of the week, "Country House" ultimately outsold Oasis' "[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll With It]]" by 274,000 copies to 216,000, becoming Blur's first number one single.<ref>Harris, 2004, p. 235</ref>

''The Great Escape'', which Albarn told the public was the last instalment in the band's Life Trilogy, was released in September 1995 to ecstatic reviews.<ref>Harris, 2004, pp. 238–239</ref> The ''NME'' hailed it as "spectacularly accomplished, sumptuous, heart-stopping and inspirational",<ref>Cigarettes, Johnny. "Blur – ''The Great Escape'' review". ''NME''.

Following the worldwide success of Oasis' ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (which went quadruple platinum in the United States), the media quipped "[Blur] wound up winning the battle but losing the war."<ref>{{cite web|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/country-house-mt0007054053|title=Country House' song review|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=16 June 2008}}</ref> Blur became perceived as an "inauthentic middle class pop band" in comparison to the "working class heroes" Oasis, which Albarn said made him feel "stupid and confused".<ref name=liveforever /> Alex James later summarised, "After being the People's Hero, Damon was the People's Prick for a short period ... basically, he was a loser – very publicly."<ref name="select">Maconie, Stuart. "The Death of a Party". ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]''. August 1999.</ref>

===Reinvention after Britpop (1996–2000)===
An early 1996 ''Q'' magazine interview revealed that relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy wrote that he found them "on the verge of a nervous breakup".<ref name="select" /> Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates: James for his playboy lifestyle, and Albarn for his control over Blur's musical direction and public image.<ref name="select" /> The guitarist struggled with drinking problems and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]].<ref>Harris, 2004, pp. 259–60</ref> In February 1996, when Coxon and James were absent for a lip-synced Blur performance broadcast on Italian television, they were replaced by a cardboard cutout and a roadie, respectively. Blur biographer [[Stuart Maconie]] later wrote that, at the time, "Blur were sewn together very awkwardly".<ref name="select" />

Although he had previously dismissed it, Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on", he said.<ref name="select" /> He subsequently approached Street, and argued for a more stripped-down sound on the band's next record. Coxon, recognising his own personal need to—as Rowntree put it—"work this band", wrote a letter to Albarn, describing his desire for their music "to scare people again". After initial sessions in London, the band left to record the rest of the album in Iceland, away from the Britpop scene.<ref name="select" />

The result was ''[[Blur (Blur album)|Blur]]'', the band's fifth studio album, released in February 1997. Although the music press predicted that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur's teenage girl fan-base, they generally applauded the effort. Pointing out lyrics such as "Look inside America/She's alright", and noting Albarn's "obligatory nod to [[Beck]], [and promotion of] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so", reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time—an about-face of their attitude during the Britpop years.<ref>Collins, Andrew. "Blur: Keeping It Simple". ''Q''. March 1997.</ref> Despite cries of "commercial suicide", the album and its first single, "[[Beetlebum]]", debuted at number one in the UK.<ref name="melody">Sutherland, Mark. "Altered States". ''[[Melody Maker]]''. 21 June 1997.</ref> Although the album could not match the sales of its predecessors in Britain, internationally ''Blur'' was more successful.<ref name="melody" /> In the US, the album received strong reviews, reached number 61 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified gold.<ref name="b200tlp">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/blur/chart-history/tlp/|title=Blur Chart History (Billboard 200)|publisher=Billboard|access-date=9 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=RIAA: Gold & Platinum certifications: Blur |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Blur |website=RIAA |access-date=10 June 2022}}</ref>  The album's second single and second track, aptly named "[[Song 2]]", was also popular on alternative radio, reaching number six on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Airplay|Modern Rock chart]] and remaining on that chart for 26 weeks.<ref name="m">{{cite magazine |title=Blur: Alternative Airplay chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/blur/chart-history/mrt |magazine=Billboard |access-date=10 June 2022}}</ref> After it was licensed for use in various media—such as soundtracks, advertisements and television shows—"Song 2" became the most recognisable Blur song in the US. After the success of ''Blur'', the band embarked on a nine-month world tour.<ref name="select" />

In February 1998, a few months after completing the tour, Blur released ''[[Bustin' + Dronin']]'' for the Japanese market. The album is a collection of Blur songs [[remix]]ed by artists such as [[Thurston Moore]], [[William Orbit]] and [[Moby]]. Among the tracks, the band were most impressed by Orbit's effort and enlisted him to replace Street as producer for their next album,<ref>{{cite web|first=Sue|last=Sillitoe|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug99/articles/stephenstreet.htm|title=Stephen Street: Producing Blur, Cranberries & Catatonia|work=[[Sound on Sound]]|date=August 1999|access-date=9 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606112835/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug99/articles/stephenstreet.htm|archive-date=6 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> citing a need to approach the recording process from a fresh perspective.<ref name="totalguitar" />

Released in March 1999, Blur's sixth studio album ''[[13 (Blur album)|13]]'' saw them drift still further away from their Britpop-era attitude and sound. Orbit's production style allowed for more jamming, and incorporated a "variety of emotions, atmospheres, words and sounds" into the mix. ''13'' was creatively dominated by Coxon, who "was simply allowed to do whatever he chose, unedited", by Orbit.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|first=Caroline|last=Sullivan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,,313434,00.html|title=Down and outstanding|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 March 2008|access-date=21 July 2008|archive-date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174209/http://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,,313434,00.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Albarn's lyrics—more heart-felt, personal and intimate than on previous occasions—were reflective of his break-up with [[Elastica]] frontwoman [[Justine Frischmann]], his partner of eight years.<ref name="guardian" /> The album received generally favourable reviews from the press. While ''Q'' called it "a dense, fascinating, idiosyncratic and accomplished [[art rock]] album",<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Tom|last=Doyle|title=Blur – 13 review|magazine=Q|date=April 1999}}</ref> the ''NME'' felt it was inconsistent and "(at least) a quarter-of-an-hour too long".<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Keith|last=Cameron|title=Blur – 13 review|magazine=NME|date=10 March 1999}}</ref> ''13'' debuted at the top of the UK charts, staying at that position for two weeks. The album's lead single, the gospel-based "[[Tender (song)|Tender]]", opened at the second spot on the charts. After "[[Coffee & TV]]", the first Blur single to feature Coxon on lead vocals, only reached number 11 in the UK, manager Chris Morrison demanded a chart re-run because of what he deemed was a sales miscalculation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/393073.stm|title=Blur boss demands chart re-run|work=[[BBC News]]|date=13 July 1999|access-date=9 June 2022}}</ref>

In July 1999, in celebration of their tenth anniversary, Blur released a [[The 10 Year Limited Edition Anniversary Box Set|22-CD limited edition box-set]] of their singles.

In an otherwise highly enthusiastic review of the best-of for the ''NME'', Steve Sutherland criticised the band's "sheer disregard" for their earlier work; "Just because these songs embarrassed them once they started listening to broadsheet critics and retreated wounded from the big-sales battle with Oasis doesn't mean that we're morons to love them."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Steve|last=Sutherland|title=Blur – Blur: The Best of review|magazine=NME|date=October 2000}}</ref>

===Coxon's departure, ''Think Tank'' and hiatus (2001–2007)===
After ''13'' and the subsequent tours in 1999–2000, band members pursued other projects. Graham Coxon recorded a string of solo albums, while Damon Albarn dedicated his time to [[Gorillaz]], the animated band he had created with [[Jamie Hewlett]]. Alex James worked with [[Fat Les]] and co-wrote several songs with [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]] and [[Marianne Faithfull]].<ref name="SR">{{cite web|first=Garry|last=Mulholland|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/21/popandrock.blur|title=Special relationships|work=The Observer|date=21 September 2003|access-date=21 August 2012|archive-date=24 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201024011949/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/21/popandrock.blur|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7773370.stm|title=What have Blur been up to?|work=BBC News|date=9 December 2008|access-date=10 January 2014}}</ref>

Albarn, however, attempted to assuage fans' fears that the album would be electronic by providing reassurances that the band's new album would be "a rockin' record", and also said that it has "a lot of finely crafted pop songs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459464/blur-get-political-on-new-lp.jhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120209083821/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459464/blur-get-political-on-new-lp.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 February 2012|title=Blur To Rock For World Peace On Next Record|work=MTV News|date=10 January 2003|access-date=21 August 2012}}</ref> Early in 2002, Blur recorded a song that would be played by [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Beagle 2]] lander once it touched down;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1790918.stm|title=Blur song on Mars Rover|work=BBC News|date=30 January 2002|access-date=11 March 2007}}</ref> however, attempts to locate the probe after it landed on [[Mars]] were fruitless.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3351023.stm|title=Beagle hopes hang on mothership|work=BBC News|date=28 December 2003|access-date=16 September 2012}}</ref>
