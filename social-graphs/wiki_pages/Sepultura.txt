Sepultura was formed in 1984 in [[Belo Horizonte]], the capital city of [[Minas Gerais]],<ref name="barcinski16"/> by brothers [[Max Cavalera|Max]] and [[Igor Cavalera]], the sons of model Vânia, and well-to-do Italian [[Diplomacy|diplomat]] Graciliano, whose death left the family in financial ruin.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 14.</ref> Graciliano's passing deeply affected his sons, inspiring them to form a band after Max heard [[Black Sabbath]]'s 1972 album ''[[Vol. 4 (Black Sabbath album)|Vol. 4]]'' the very same day.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Roots |title-link=Roots (Sepultura album) |others=Sepultura |year=2005 |chapter=The Roots of Sepultura |first=Steffan |last=Chirazi |page=13 |type=CD booklet |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |location= New York, New York}}</ref> They chose the name Sepultura, the Portuguese word for "grave", when Max translated the lyrics of the [[Motörhead]] song "Dancing on Your Grave".<ref name="Barcinski17"/> The brothers were previously in a cover band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metallian.com/sepultura.php |title=Sepultura band interview |publisher=metallian.com |date=10 April 1995 |access-date=27 May 2024}}</ref>

The brothers' early influences included [[Led Zeppelin]], Black Sabbath, [[Deep Purple]], [[Van Halen]], [[Iron Maiden]], Motörhead, [[AC/DC]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[V8 (band)|V8]], [[Terveet Kädet]], [[Rattus (band)|Rattus]], and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]].<ref name="barcinski16"/> They would travel to a record shop in [[São Paulo]] that mixed tapes of then-latest records by American bands.<ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12">{{cite news|last=Baird|first=Robert|title=The Boys from Brazil Transplanted to Phoenix, Sepultura Strives for Death Metal with a Conscience|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/160396|access-date=August 3, 2010|newspaper=Phoenix New Times|date=May 12, 1993|archive-date=August 10, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810041105/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/160396/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their listening habits changed after they were introduced to [[Venom (band)|Venom]]. As Igor Cavalera put it:

{{cquote|"I remember the first time I listened to Venom, it was on a friend's borrowed tape. It was similar to Motörhead, only a lot heavier. I remember someone saying: it's the devil's Motörhead! After we got acquainted with Venom, we stopped listening to Iron Maiden and all that lighter stuff."<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 19.</ref>}}

The Cavalera brothers started listening to more extreme metal bands such as [[Hellhammer]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]], [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]], and [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 26.</ref> They were also influenced by Brazilian metal bands like [[Stress (Brazilian band)|Stress]], [[Sagrado Inferno]], and [[Dorsal Atlântica]]. By 1984, they had dropped out of school.<ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/> After several early membership changes, Sepultura established a stable lineup of Max on guitar, Igor on drums, lead vocalist [[Wagner Lamounier]], and bassist [[Paulo Jr.]]<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 21.</ref> Lamounier departed in March 1985 and became the leader of pioneering Brazilian [[black metal]] band [[Sarcófago]]. Max took over the vocal duties and [[Jairo Guedz]] joined the band as lead guitarist.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 28.</ref>

After a year of performing, Sepultura signed with [[Cogumelo Records]] in 1985. Later that year, they released ''[[Bestial Devastation]]'', a split EP with Brazilian band Overdose. It was recorded and self-produced in just two days. The band recorded their first full-length album, ''[[Morbid Visions]]'', in August 1986. It contained their first hit, "Troops of Doom", which gained some media attention. The band relocated to São Paulo.<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/>

===''Schizophrenia'', ''Beneath the Remains'' and ''Arise'' (1987–1992)===
[[File:Sepultura in performance (Lisboa 2004).jpg|thumb|[[Andreas Kisser]] has been the lead guitarist of Sepultura since 1987. His arrival provided the group with a more technical experience.]]
In early 1987, Guedz quit the band and was replaced by São Paulo-based guitarist [[Andreas Kisser]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 49.</ref> They released their second studio album, and debut with Kisser, ''[[Schizophrenia (Sepultura album)|Schizophrenia]]'', in October of that year. The album reflected a change towards a thrash metal-oriented sound while retaining the death metal elements of ''Morbid Visions''. ''Schizophrenia'' displayed improved production and performance, becoming a minor critical sensation and sought-after import in Europe and North America. The band sent tapes to the United States that made radio playlists during a time when they were struggling to book shows as club owners were wary of their style.<ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/> Sepultura gained attention from [[Roadrunner Records]], who signed them in the spring of 1988 and released ''Schizophrenia'' internationally before seeing the band perform in person.<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/><ref name="Angle 2024-04-03"/><ref name="Colon 1991-08-07">{{cite news|last=Colon|first=Suzan|title=Name That Tomb|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/content/printVersion/233397|access-date=August 2, 2010|newspaper=Miami New Times|date=August 1, 1991|archive-date=March 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316021038/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/content/printVersion/233397/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Max Cavalera recalled to ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' magazine, "We were finally going to get a real label, real producer, real studio.

This is our shot. You only get so many shots in this life, and you gotta make it count."<ref name="Angle 2024-04-03"/>

During a May 2018 interview, Kisser noted that Sepultura would not have been possible without family support, not only from his own family, but also from the families of Max and Igor, and Paulo Jr.<ref>{{cite web|title=May 2018 Interview With Derrick Green and Andreas Kisser|url=https://teenyrockers.com/blogs/milk-hugs-rock-n-roll/teeny-rockers-presents-sepultura|website=Teenyrockers.com|date=May 14, 2018 }}</ref>

Sepultura's third studio album, ''[[Beneath the Remains]]'', was released in April 1989. The album was recorded towards the end of 1988 in a rustic studio in Rio de Janeiro.

In January 1991, Sepultura played for more than 100,000 people at the [[Rock in Rio]] II festival. The band relocated to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] in 1990, obtained new management, and recorded their fourth studio album, ''[[Arise (Sepultura album)|Arise]]'', at [[Morrisound Recording|Morrisound Studios]] in Tampa, Florida.<ref name="Phoenix Times 1993-05-12"/> By the time the album was released in March 1991, the band had become one of the most critically praised thrash/death metal bands of the time. The first single, "[[Dead Embryonic Cells]]", was a success, and the [[Arise (Sepultura song)|title track]] gained additional attention when MTV banned its video due to its apocalyptic religious imagery. It did, however, get some airplay on ''Headbangers Ball'' as did the music videos for "Dead Embryonic Cells" and "Desperate Cry".<ref name="MTV HBB"/> ''Arise'' was critically acclaimed and their first to chart on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], reaching No. 119.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1991-05-04/billboard-200

Sepultura's fifth album, ''[[Chaos A.D.]]'', was released in September 1993.

Also in 1994, Max and Igor formed [[Nailbomb]] with Alex Newport of Fudge Tunnel. They released an industrial-oriented album, ''[[Point Blank (Nailbomb album)|Point Blank]]'', the same year. The group performed its only proper show for nearly two decades at [[Dynamo Open Air]] in 1995, which was released as a live album, ''[[Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide]]''. Nailbomb disbanded shortly afterward.

Sepultura's sound continued changing with their sixth album, ''[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]'', released in February 1996. The band experimented with Brazil's indigenous music, and adopted a slower, down-tuned sound. The album was hailed{{by whom|date=January 2025}} as a modern-day heavy metal classic and a major influence on the then-nascent [[nu metal]] scene. [[AllMusic]] gave it a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5 and said, "''Roots'' consolidates Sepultura's position as perhaps the most distinctive, original heavy metal band of the 1990s."<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r233334 |title=Roots – Sepultura |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 20, 2011}}</ref> Also in 1996, Sepultura performed "War (Guerra)" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

===Departure of Max Cavalera, Derrick Green joins and ''Against'' (1996–2000)===
In August 1996, Sepultura played on the Castle Donington [[Monsters of Rock]] main stage with [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], [[Type O Negative]], [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], and [[Fear Factory]]. The band performed as a three-piece with Andreas Kisser on lead vocals after Max Cavalera left the concert site earlier in the day upon learning of his stepson Dana Wells's death in a car accident. After Wells's funeral, Max returned and continued to tour with Sepultura. A few months after Wells's death, the band met with Max and said they wanted to fire their manager Gloria Bujnowski, Max's wife and Dana's mother, and find new management. Their reasoning was that Bujnowski was giving Max preferential treatment while neglecting the rest of the band. Max, still coming to terms with Wells's death, felt betrayed and quit the band.<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/> Cavalera's final performance with Sepultura was at the [[Brixton Academy]] in England on December 16, 1996.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Blabbermouth |date=2002-04-09 |title=Sepultura: Last-Ever Show With Max To Be Issued On CD |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sepultura-last-ever-show-with-max-to-be-issued-on-cd/ |access-date=2024-05-01 |website=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |language=en}}</ref> He left Sepultura in January 1997 as the band had opted not to renew a management contract with Bujnowski.<ref name="Max departure">{{multiref|{{cite news |language=Italian |title=l'Unità (1997-01-29) |newspaper=[[l'Unità]] |page=6 |date=29 January 1997 |url=https://archive.org/details/unita_1997-01-29/page/n21/mode/2up?q=%22Max+Cavalera%22 |access-date=1 March 2025 }}|{{cite news |language=Spanish |title=Diario Página/12 19970130 |newspaper=[[Página 12]] |pages=4–5 |date=30 January 1997 |url=https://archive.org/details/BNA_S001207768_19970130N00257No/page/n3/mode/2up?q=%22Max+Cavalera%22 |access-date=1 March 2025}}|{{cite magazine |title=Music News & Views |magazine=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]] |date=7 February 1997 |location=New York City, New York |publisher=Cash Box Publications |page=30 |url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Archive-RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-02-07.pdf |access-date=1 March 2025 }}|{{cite magazine |last=Lannert |first=John |title=Artists & Music |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=22 February 1997 |location=New York City, New York |page=30 |url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-02-22.pdf |access-date=1 March 2025}}}}</ref>
