Bates informally describes the music as "cinematic rock".<ref name="Allbio" /> In elaborating further, he said it's "as if a [[hard rock|hard-rock]] band did the soundtrack to an epic blockbuster movie. ... We're blending [[symphony|symphonics]] with [[electronic rock|electronics]] with [[guitar riff|riff-driven]], [[baritone guitar]] hard rock".<ref name="Richards" /> Bates explained the evolution of sound with the band's second album, ''Vessels'': "Whereas [''Transmissions''] was centered in the hard rock lane before, now it goes more [[heavy metal music|metal]] at times, and the guitar work borrows from [[djent]] stylings, and it gets more [[ambient music|ambient]] at times, using [[electronic music|electronics]] at a more deeply integrated level. Whereas the [[String instrument|strings]] were more cinematic, there was more of a [[quartet]] before, on this record it’s more of an [[orchestration]]."<ref name="MusicFeed">{{cite web|last=Kennedy |first=Jade |url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/features/with-starsets-vessels-dustin-bates-seeks-to-bring-out-the-scientist-in-all-of-us/ |title=With Starset's New Album 'Vessels' Dustin Bates Seeks To Bring Out The Scientist In All Of Us |publisher=Music Feeds |date=February 1, 2017 |access-date=May 24, 2017}}</ref>
