'''Buckcherry''' is an American [[hard rock]] band from [[Anaheim, California]], formed in 1995. The band released two albums, ''[[Buckcherry (album)|Buckcherry]]'' (1999) and ''[[Time Bomb (Buckcherry album)|Time Bomb]]'' (2001), before dissolving in 2002. Buckcherry's first album ''Buckcherry'' was DreamWorks' first album to go gold. In 2005, lead vocalist [[Josh Todd (musician)|Josh Todd]] and lead guitarist Keith Nelson reformed Buckcherry with a new lineup and released a new album in 2006, ''[[15 (Buckcherry album)|15]]''. It contained Buckcherry's biggest crossover hits to date, "[[Crazy Bitch]]", and their first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top ten hit, "[[Sorry (Buckcherry song)|Sorry]]". The band continued to record albums, releasing seven between 2008 and 2023: ''[[Black Butterfly (Buckcherry album)|Black Butterfly]]'' in 2008, ''[[All Night Long (Buckcherry album)|All Night Long]]'' in 2010, ''[[Confessions (Buckcherry album)|Confessions]]'' in 2013, ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (Buckcherry album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'' in 2015, ''[[Warpaint (Buckcherry album)|Warpaint]]'' in 2019, ''Hellbound'' in 2021 and ''Vol. 10'' in 2023. Their eleventh album, ''[[Roar Like Thunder]]'' was released in June 2025.

==History==

===Formation: 1995–1999===
[[Josh Todd (musician)|Josh Todd]] grew up in the [[Anaheim Hills]] neighborhood of [[Anaheim, California]] and later moved to [[Lake Forest, California]]. Early on, Todd fronted the Hollywood glam rock band Slamhound. He eventually met lead guitarist Keith Nelson through their tattoo artist (Kevin Quinn).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tattoo.about.com/od/newsandviews/a/Interview-With-Buckcherry-Josh-Todd-And-Xavier-Muriel-Talk-Tattoos.htm |title=Tattoos of Buckcherry - Buckcherry Rock Band Interview - Josh Todd and Xavier Muriel's Tattoos |publisher=Tattoo.about.com |date=August 3, 2010 |access-date=February 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403113404/http://tattoo.about.com/od/newsandviews/a/Interview-With-Buckcherry-Josh-Todd-And-Xavier-Muriel-Talk-Tattoos.htm |archive-date=April 3, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The duo made a few demos before being joined by bassist [[Jonathan Brightman]] and drummer Devon Glenn, calling themselves Sparrow. Sparrow began performing around the Hollywood club scene, receiving a strong, local following due to their old school [[rock and roll]] vibe, and were signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] shortly after. The group changed its name to Buckcherry after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from a record label called [[Sparrow Records|Sparrow]] (owned by [[EMI]]). Although the band's name is a [[spoonerism]] of the late [[Chuck Berry]], the group said it was inspired by a drag queen acquaintance of theirs named Buck Cherry.

===Commercial success: 1999–2002===
The band released its [[Buckcherry (album)|self-titled debut]] in 1999 to critical praise and certified gold sales. The album, produced by [[Terry Date]] ([[Soundgarden]]/[[Mother Love Bone]]/[[Pantera]]/[[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]]/[[Deftones]]), included the hit singles "[[Lit Up]]", "[[For the Movies]]", "[[Dead Again (song)|Dead Again]]", and "[[Check Your Head (song)|Check Your Head]]".

After adding rhythm guitarist Yogi Lonich to the lineup in 1999, Buckcherry toured nonstop in support of the debut album, including opening for [[Lenny Kravitz]] on his Freedom Tour (1999) and participating at the infamous [[Woodstock 99]], before going back into the studio in 2000 to work on a follow-up, ''[[Time Bomb (Buckcherry album)|Time Bomb]]'' (2001). The second album was considered a disappointment by many critics,<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Jacobetz |first=Steven |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/time-bomb-mw0000586701 |title=Time Bomb - Buckcherry : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=March 27, 2001 |access-date=February 22, 2013}}</ref> and it did not fare as well on the charts. [[Allmusic]] noted that "For a second record, it's surprising how jaded and [[nihilism|nihilistic]] they are already."<ref name=autogenerated1 />
Buckcherry performed opening dates for [[AC/DC]] in the spring of 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaccessmagazine.com/vol5/issue03/buckcherry.html |title=Buckcherry :: Fifteen :: All Access Magazine :: It's All About The Music |publisher=All Access Magazine |date=March 15, 2007 |access-date=February 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719143553/http://www.allaccessmagazine.com/vol5/issue03/buckcherry.html |archive-date=July 19, 2011 |url-status=usurped }}</ref> From August 2001 through January 2002, as tension over the musical direction set in, [[Jonathan Brightman]], Yogi Lonich, and Devon Glenn each successively left Buckcherry, and were replaced by Dave Markasky, Josh Fleeger, and Matt Lawrence, respectively. Josh Todd and Keith Nelson still planned to continue the band, and began the writing process for a third album. The album was never completed, however, and the band was put on hiatus in July 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/buckcherry/artist.jhtml#bio |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524153159/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/buckcherry/artist.jhtml%23bio |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 24, 2012 |title=Buckcherry &#124; New Music And Songs |publisher=MTV |access-date=February 22, 2013}}</ref>

===Other projects: 2002–2005===
[[Josh Todd (musician)|Josh Todd]] and Keith Nelson performed together along with ex-[[Guns N' Roses]] members [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Duff McKagan]], and [[Matt Sorum]] (also of [[The Cult]]) at the [[Randy Castillo]] tribute concert. Speculation ensued that Josh Todd would become the lead vocalist of the project headed up by Slash, Duff McKagan, and Matt Sorum. Josh Todd spent a month in the studio, reportedly completing 10 songs, but was abruptly dropped from the project by Slash. Todd was quoted as saying, "It was amazing, the band was slamming, and then Slash just came in one day and just shit-canned the whole thing". In his autobiography, Slash says the reason was because he was displeased with how Todd's voice sounded when they played the material back. [[Scott Weiland]] of [[Stone Temple Pilots]] was eventually chosen to helm the band that would become known as [[Velvet Revolver]]. Keith Nelson was given a songwriting credit on Velvet Revolver's track "[[Dirty Little Thing]]". Nelson then went on to write and produce on various records.

===Commercial success and ''Crüe Fest'': 2005–2009===
[[File:Buckcherry B&W.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Buckcherry at the Sunshine Theater in 2007]]
In 2005, Josh Todd reformed Buckcherry with Keith Nelson and new members Stevie D. of [[Automatic Black]], Jimmy Ashhurst, and Xavier Muriel.
In 2006, the band released the album ''[[15 (Buckcherry album)|15]]'' to commercial and critical success. It resurrected the band with hits "[[Crazy Bitch]]", "[[Sorry (Buckcherry song)|Sorry]]", "[[Everything (Buckcherry song)|Everything]]" and "Next 2 You".

Back on September 11, 2006, another lawsuit had been filed against the band, their current record label, and other related companies on behalf of a sixteen-year-old girl who claimed she was coerced into appearing topless and in various sexual scenarios at a concert while the band was playing a sexually related song. According to sources, however, all participants in the [[Crazy Bitch]] video<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/buckcherry_sued_over_crazy_bitch_video.html | title=Buckcherry Sued over 'Crazy Bitch' Video }}</ref> had to show proof that they were over eighteen years old and sign a release form further reaffirming their age. Band attorney Skip Miller is quoted in several news stories as stating, "This woman filled out a release form with false information. And once it was determined this woman was underage, the video was removed."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-sep-11-fi-warner11-story.html|title=Labels Sued Over Sexy Video of Minor|last=Duhigg|first=Charles|date=September 11, 2006|website=L.A.

On September 16, 2008, the band released their fourth album, ''[[Black Butterfly (Buckcherry album)|Black Butterfly]]'', which debuted at number 8 on the top 200 charts. It was the number one rock album that week. That year, [[Josh Todd (musician)|Josh Todd]] was featured on the album ''[[This War Is Ours]]'' by [[Escape the Fate]].

On September 29, 2009, Buckcherry released their first live album, ''[[Live & Loud 2009]]'', which they played some of their biggest songs such as "[[Sorry (Buckcherry song)|Sorry]]", "[[Lit Up]]", "[[Crazy Bitch]]", and much more.
