{{Main|Lungs (album)|l1=Lungs}}
The name of Florence and the Machine is attributed to [[Florence Welch]]'s teenage collaboration with [[Isabella Summers|Isabella "Machine" Summers]]. Welch and Summers performed together for a time under the name Florence Robot/Isa Machine. According to Welch, "The name Florence and the Machine started off as a [[In-joke|private joke]] that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot Is A Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad."<ref name="Timesbio">{{cite web |last=Patterson |first=Sylvia |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6838997.ece |title=Behind the success of Florence and the Machine |work=[[The Sunday Times]]  |date=20 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615093956/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6838997.ece |archive-date=15 June 2011 |access-date=7 March 2010}}</ref><ref name="naming">{{cite web |last=Bell |first=Sean |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/life-style/real-lives/a-piece-of-my-mind-florence-welch-of-florence-and-the-machine-1.820514 |title=A piece of my mind: Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=26 July 2009 |access-date=6 March 2010 |archive-date=28 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928001632/http://www.heraldscotland.com/life-style/real-lives/a-piece-of-my-mind-florence-welch-of-florence-and-the-machine-1.820514 |url-status=live}}</ref> In addition to Summers (keyboards), the current band members include musicians Robert Ackroyd (guitar), Chris Hayden (drums, percussion and backing vocals), Mark Saunders (bass guitar and percussion) and Tom Monger (harp).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomtheharpist.com/london.html |title=Tom in London |publisher=tomtheharpist.com |access-date=31 December 2010 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205008/http://www.tomtheharpist.com/london.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> In the past, Welch has praised her band for understanding her creative process, claiming, "I've worked with most of them for a long time and they know my style, know the way I write, they know what I want."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.florenceandthemachine.net/biography/2-3 |title=Florence and the Machine: About |publisher=florenceandthemachine.net |access-date=26 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105205126/http://www.florenceandthemachine.net/biography/2-3 |archive-date=5 November 2011}}</ref>

===2011–2013: ''Ceremonials''===
{{Main|Ceremonials}}

The first demo session occurred in January 2010 with Welch and [[Paul Epworth]] at a small London studio. Numerous producers expressed an interest in working on the album but Welch rejected the offers because she wanted ''Ceremonials'' to be a better version of ''Lungs'' with a "more dark, more heavy, bigger drum sounds, bigger bass, but with more of a whole sound". For the rest of the year work on the album continued only intermittently as the band concentrated on an extensive tour of the US, where ''Lungs'' had become popular. The majority of the writing for the album was done between January and April 2011, with recording taking place in April at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Refinement took place at Epworth's own London studios while Welch recorded vocal tracks in various US studios, during days off from touring. The final recording session took place in July at Epworth's studio.<ref name="BillboardCeremonials">{{cite magazine |last=Smirke |first=Richard |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467115/florence-the-machine-the-billboard-cover-story |title=Florence & The Machine: The Billboard Cover Story |magazine=Billboard |date=30 September 2011 |access-date=18 March 2012 |archive-date=29 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429192100/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467115/florence-the-machine-the-billboard-cover-story |url-status=live}}</ref> Epworth co-wrote seven tracks.

Florence and the Machine played at Australia's [[Splendour in the Grass]] music festival in July 2010. The group drew one of the biggest crowds of the three-day festival. They performed in the natural open-air amphitheatre, which had to be closed off by security due to safety concerns as an unprecedented number of festival-goers rushed to see the performance. It is estimated that 28,000 people of the 33,000 people who attended the festival crammed in to see Florence and the Machine. The amphitheatre was reopened shortly after the start, once the safety concerns were allayed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qt.com.au/story/2010/07/29/record-crowds-prepare-for-splendour/ |title=Splendour fans head to Woodford |work=[[The Queensland Times]] |date=29 July 2010 |access-date=4 September 2010 |archive-date=2 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802034611/http://www.qt.com.au/story/2010/07/29/record-crowds-prepare-for-splendour/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In October 2009, the band's equipment and instruments were caught in a trailer fire during their European tour, forcing the band to use rented instruments to complete their remaining shows.<ref>{{cite web |last=Roche |first=Simon |url=http://www.state.ie/16979-news/florence-the-machines-gear-destroyed-in-fire |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120912215306/http://www.state.ie/16979-news/florence-the-machines-gear-destroyed-in-fire |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 September 2012 |title=Florence & The Machine's Gear Destroyed in Fire |work=State Magazine |date=11 October 2009 |access-date=16 June 2011 }}</ref> Welch stated, "You could hear the [[harp]]'s strings ping in the fire.
