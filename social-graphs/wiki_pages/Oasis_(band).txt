'''Oasis''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Manchester]] in 1991. The group initially consisted of [[Liam Gallagher]] (lead vocals), [[Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs]] (guitar), [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan]] (bass guitar) and [[Tony McCarroll]] (drums). Liam asked his older brother [[Noel Gallagher]] (lead guitar, vocals) to join as a fifth member a few months later to finalise their formation. Noel became the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the group and took over the songwriting duties for the band's first four studio albums.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/27/arts/music/oasis-reunion-gallagher-breakup-feud.html |title=Oasis: Timeline of a Sibling Rivalry for the Ages|date=27 August 2024|first=Victor|last=Mather|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=28 June 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2024/music/news/oasis-break-up-liam-noel-gallagher-fights-1236118668/ |title=Oasis at War: Liam and Noel Gallagher's 10 Biggest Fights|date=27 August 2024|first=A.D.|last=Amorosi|work=Variety|access-date=28 June 2025}}</ref> They are regarded as one of the defining and most globally successful groups of the [[Britpop]] genre.<ref name=":3">{{cite web |last=Stegall |first=Tim |date=23 July 2021 |title=10 reasons why Oasis are the most influential Britpop band of all time |url=https://www.altpress.com/features/bands-influenced-by-oasis/ |access-date=28 January 2022 |work=Alternative Press}}</ref>

Oasis signed to independent record label [[Creation Records]] in 1993 and released their record-setting debut studio album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994), which topped the [[UK Albums Chart]] and quickly became the fastest-selling debut album in British history at the time. The following year, they released follow up album ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995) with new drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan "Whitey" White]] in the midst of a highly publicised chart rivalry with peers [[Blur (band)|Blur]], dubbed by the British media as the "[[Battle of Britpop]]". Spending ten weeks at number one on the British charts, ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' was also an international chart success and became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|UK's third-best-selling album]], and the [[List of best-selling albums of the 1990s in the United Kingdom|UK's best-selling album of the 1990s]]. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid newspapers]] throughout the 1990s for their public disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] for an audience of 125,000 each time, the largest outdoor concerts in UK history at the time. In 1997, Oasis released their highly anticipated third studio album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'', which became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. It retrospectively was seen as a critical disappointment.

Founding members Arthurs and McGuigan left in 1999 during the recording of the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'' (2000). They were replaced by former [[Heavy Stereo]] guitarist [[Gem Archer]] on guitar and [[Ride (band)|Ride]] guitarist [[Andy Bell (Welsh musician)|Andy Bell]] on bass guitar. White departed in 2004, replaced by touring member [[Zak Starkey]]. Oasis released three more studio albums in the 2000s: ''[[Heathen Chemistry]]'' (2002), ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'' (2008). The group abruptly disbanded in  August 2009 after an argument between the Gallagher brothers prior to a gig in Paris, France at the Rock en Seine festival and the sudden departure of Noel Gallagher. The remaining members of the band continued under the name [[Beady Eye]] until their disbandment in 2014. Both Gallagher brothers have since had successful solo careers. Oasis reformed in 2024 and concurrently announced the [[Oasis Live '25 Tour]], which they embarked on the following year.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Trendell |first=Andrew |date=2024-08-27 |title="The great wait is over" – Oasis announce 2025 UK and Ireland reunion tour |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/oasis-reunion-tour-uk-ireland-stadium-2025-liam-noel-gallagher-tickets-3787539 |access-date=2025-07-12 |website=NME |language=en-GB}}</ref> The band currently consists of the Gallagher brothers, Arthurs, Archer and Bell.

==History==
===1991–1993: Formation and early years <span class="anchor" id="the_rain"></span>===
In 1990, bassist [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul McGuigan]], guitarist [[Paul Arthurs]], drummer [[Tony McCarroll]], and singer Chris Hutton formed a band called the Rain.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Don't Look Back in Anger: Growing Up with Oasis |last1=Hutton |first1=Chris |last2=Kurt |first2=Richard |isbn= 0671015672 |date=1998 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |url=https://archive.org/details/dontlookbackinan0000hutt |pages=90–102}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=McCarroll |first=Tony |title=Oasis: The Truth: My Life as Oasis's Drummer |date=2011 |isbn=978-1843584995 |publisher=Kings Road Publishing |url=https://archive.org/details/oasistruthmylife0000mcca |pages=40–45}}</ref> Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance [[Liam Gallagher]] as a potential replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis, inspired by an [[Inspiral Carpets]] tour poster in the childhood bedroom he shared with his brother [[Noel Gallagher|Noel]], which listed the [[Oasis Leisure Centre]] in [[Swindon]] as a venue.<ref>Harris, John.

Noel approached the group about joining on the provision that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. Arthurs recalled, "He had loads of stuff written. When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. All of a sudden, there were loads of ideas."<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;125–26</ref> Under Noel, the band crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity, with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing [[barre chord]]s and [[root (chord)|root bass notes]], McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion. Oasis thus created a sound described as being "so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable".<ref>Harris, pg.&nbsp;127–28</ref>

=== 1993–1994: Breakthrough with ''Definitely Maybe'' ===
After over a year of live shows, rehearsals and a recording of a demo, the ''Live Demonstration'' tape, in May 1993, Oasis were spotted by the [[Creation Records]] co-owner [[Alan McGee]]. Oasis were invited to play a gig at [[King Tut's Wah Wah Hut]] club in [[Glasgow]] by Sister Lovers, who shared their rehearsal rooms. Oasis, along with a group of friends, hired a van and made the journey to Glasgow. When they arrived, they were refused entry as they were not on that night's set list. They and McGee have given contradicting statements about how they entered the club.<ref>VH1 Behind the Music, [[VH1]], 2000</ref> They were given the opening slot and impressed McGee, who was there to see [[18 Wheeler (band)|18 Wheeler]], and Sister Lovers, whose member Debbie Turner was a close friend of McGee's from his days frequenting [[the Haçienda]] in Manchester.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dingwall |first=John |date=2013-11-17 |title=Music guru Alan McGee: If I'm being honest.. all I could wish for came true |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity-interviews/music-guru-alan-mcgee-im-2798664 |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=Daily Record |language=en}}</ref> McGee offered them a recording contract; however, they did not sign until several months later.<ref>"Oasis." Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> Due to problems securing an American contract, Oasis signed a worldwide contract with [[Sony]], which in turn licensed Oasis to Creation in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 131</ref>

Following a limited [[white label record|white label]] release of the demo of their song "Columbia", Oasis went on a UK tour to promote the release of their first single, "[[Supersonic (Oasis song)|Supersonic]]", playing venues such as the [[The Forum, Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells Forum]], a converted public toilet. "Supersonic" was released in April 1994, reaching number&nbsp;31 in the charts.<ref>Harris, pg. 149</ref> The release was followed by "[[Shakermaker]]", which became the subject of a plagiarism suit, with Oasis paying $500,000 in damages.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Mundy |first=Chris |date=1996-05-02 |title=Ruling Asses: Oasis Have Conquered America, and They Won't Shut Up About It |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/oasis-ruling-asses-243843/ |access-date=2024-05-11 |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> Their third single, "[[Live Forever (Oasis song)|Live Forever]]", was their first to enter the top ten of the [[UK Singles Chart]]. After troubled recording and mixing sessions, Oasis's debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'', was released on 29 August 1994. It entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number one within a week of its release, and at the time becoming the fastest selling debut album in the UK.<ref>Harris, pg. 178</ref>

Nearly a year of constant live performances and recordings, along with a [[hedonistic]] lifestyle, damaged the band. This behaviour culminated during a gig in Los Angeles in September 1994, leading to an inept performance by Liam during which he made offensive remarks about American audiences and hit Noel with a tambourine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grundy|first=Gareth|title=Born To Feud|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher|work=The Guardian|date=30 August 2009|access-date=27 February 2013|archive-date=29 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229011850/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/30/oasis-split-liam-noel-gallagher|url-status=live}}</ref> Upset, Noel temporarily quit the band and flew to San Francisco (it was from this incident the song "[[Talk Tonight]]" was written). He was tracked down by Creation's Tim Abbot and they made a trip to Las Vegas. Once there, he was persuaded to continue with the band. He reconciled with Liam and the tour resumed in [[Minneapolis]].<ref>Harris, pg. 189</ref> The group followed up with the fourth single from ''Definitely Maybe'', "[[Cigarettes & Alcohol]]", and the Christmas single "[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]", issued in December 1994, which entered the British charts at number three.<ref>Harris, pg. 213</ref>

===1995–1996: ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', international success, and peak popularity===
In April 1995, "[[Some Might Say]]" became their first number-one UK single. At the same time, McCarroll was ousted from the band. He said he was "unlawfully expelled from the partnership" for what he called a "personality clash" with the brothers. The Gallaghers were critical of McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: "I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn't have been able to drum the new songs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/entertainment/music_feature/news/52861/Almost_famous.html|title=Supanet entertainment music feature|publisher=Supanet.com|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622220353/https://www.supanet.com/entertainment/music_feature/news/52861/Almost_famous.html|archive-date=22 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/288881.stm|title=£550,000 for sacked Oasis drummer|work=BBC News|date=3 March 1999|access-date=3 February 2008|archive-date=30 June 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030630093536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/288881.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]], formerly of [[Starclub]] and brother of [[Steve White (drummer)|Steve White]], who was recommended to Noel by [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]].

Oasis began recording material for their second album that May in [[Rockfield Studios]] near [[Monmouth]].<ref name=":2">Harris, pg. 226</ref> During this period, the British press seized upon a supposed rivalry between Oasis and another [[Britpop]] band, [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. Previously, Oasis had not associated with the Britpop movement and were not invited to perform on the [[BBC]]'s ''Britpop Now'' programme introduced by Blur's singer, [[Damon Albarn]]. On 14 August 1995, Blur and Oasis released singles on the same day, setting up the [[Britpop#"The Battle of Britpop"|"Battle of Britpop"]] that dominated the national news.<ref>{{cite news |title=When Blur beat Oasis in the battle of Britpop |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/blur-beat-oasis-in-chart-battle/ |access-date=17 September 2019 |work=The Telegraph |archive-date=25 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325233841/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/blur-beat-oasis-in-chart-battle/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Blur's "[[Country House (Blur song)|Country House]]" outsold Oasis's "[[Roll with It (Oasis song)|Roll with It]]" 274,000 copies to 216,000 during the week.<ref>Harris, pg. 235</ref> Oasis's management argued that "Country House" had sold more because it was less expensive (£1.99 vs £3.99) and because there were two versions of the "Country House" single, with different B-sides, forcing fans to buy two copies.<ref>Harris, pg. 233</ref> Creation said there were problems with the barcode on the "Roll with It" single case, which did not record all sales.<ref>Author unknown.

McGuigan briefly left Oasis in September 1995, citing nervous exhaustion. He was replaced by [[:simple:Scott McLeod|Scott McLeod]], formerly of the Ya Ya's, who was featured on some of the tour dates as well as in the "Wonderwall" video before leaving abruptly while on tour in the US. McLeod contacted Noel, saying he felt he had made the wrong decision. Noel replied: "I think you have, too. Good luck signing on."<ref name=":1">{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/glastonbury2004/story/0,,1242267,00.html|title=Not here now|work=The Guardian|date=19 June 2004|last=Robinson|first=John|access-date=9 March 2008|location=London|archive-date=2 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002042228/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/jun/19/glastonbury2004.popandrock|url-status=live}}</ref>  After McLeod's departure Arthurs briefly shifted to [[bass guitar]] before McGuigan was convinced to rejoin. The band's appearance on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' was as a foursome with Arthurs on bass.

Although a softer sound initially led to mixed reviews, Oasis's second album, ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', was a worldwide commercial success, selling over four million copies and becoming the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|fifth-best-selling album]] in UK chart history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-60-official-biggest-selling-albums-of-all-time-revealed__15551/|title=The UK's 60 official biggest selling albums of all time revealed|last=Copsey|first=Rob|date=4 July 2016|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709012251/http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-60-official-biggest-selling-albums-of-all-time-revealed__15551/|archive-date=9 July 2016|url-status=live|access-date=11 May 2018}}</ref> By 2008, it had sold up to 22 million copies globally, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6151050.stm|title=Queen head all-time sales chart|work=BBC News|date=16 November 2006|access-date=9 March 2008|archive-date=4 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204064437/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6151050.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> The album produced two more singles, "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]" and "[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]", which reached numbers two and one.

The song reached number one on the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. In November 1995, Oasis played on back-to-back nights at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] in London, the biggest ever indoor gigs in Europe at the time. Noel played a customised Sheraton guitar emblazoned with a [[Union Jack]], commercially released by [[Epiphone]] as the "Supernova".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mason |first1=Tom |last2=Randall |first2=Lucian |title=Noel Gallagher - The Biography |date=2012 |publisher=John Blake |isbn=9781782190912 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zatDwAAQBAJ&dq=Noel+Gallagher+-+Epiphone+Sheraton+guitar+Union+Jack&pg=PT91}}</ref>

| quote =What Oasis has done in Britain, unifying an entire country under the banner of a single pop act, a band could no longer achieve in a country like the US. In Britain the band reigns unchallenged as the most popular act since the Beatles, there is an Oasis CD in roughly one of every three homes there. Last month, the band drew 250,000 people to Knebworth for the biggest outdoor concerts in the country's history.

Oasis were due to record an episode of ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] but Liam pulled out, citing a sore throat. He watched the performance from a balcony with beer and cigarettes, heckling Noel's singing between songs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Haydon|first=John|title=The List: Liam Gallagher's worst moments|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/17/list-liam-gallaghers-worst-moments/|work=The Washington Times|access-date=27 February 2013|archive-date=4 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804001215/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/17/list-liam-gallaghers-worst-moments/|url-status=live}}</ref> Four days later the group left for a tour of American arenas but Liam refused to go; the band decided to continue the tour with Noel on vocals.<ref>Harris, pg. 310</ref> Liam rejoined the tour on 30 August and on 4 September 1996, Oasis performed "Champagne Supernova" at the [[1996 MTV Video Music Awards]] at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City.<ref name="MTVAwards">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1996/|title=1996 MTV Video Music Awards|publisher=MTV|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-date=12 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612185016/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1996/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Liam made gestures at Noel during his guitar solo, then spat beer all over the stage before storming off.<ref name="MTVAwards"/> A few weeks later Noel flew home without the band, who followed on another flight.<ref>Harris, pg. 312</ref> This event prompted media speculation that the group were splitting up.

===1996–1999: ''Be Here Now'' and ''The Masterplan''===
Oasis spent the end of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997 at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London and Ridge Farm Studios in [[Surrey]] recording their third album. Quarrels between the Gallagher brothers plagued the recording sessions. ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' was released in August 1997. Preceded by the UK number&nbsp;one single "[[D'You Know What I Mean?]]", the album was their most anticipated effort, and as such became the subject of considerable media attention. Footage of excited fans clutching copies made ''[[ITV News at Ten]]'', leading anchorman [[Trevor McDonald]] to intone the band's phrase "mad for it".<ref name="Lynskey"/> By the end of the first day of release, ''Be Here Now'' had sold 424,000 units and first week sales reached 696,000, making it the fastest-selling album in British history until [[Adele]] released ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]'' in 2015.<ref name="Lynskey"/><ref>Harris, pg. 342.</ref> The album debuted at number&nbsp;two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US, but its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924518/live_forever|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715015259/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924518/live_forever|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 July 2007|title=Rolling Stone news article|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=28 September 2014}}</ref> Predominantly written by Noel Gallagher during a holiday with [[Kate Moss]], [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Mick Jagger]], Gallagher has since expressed regret over the writing process of ''Be Here Now'', adding it doesn't match up to the standard of the band's first two albums:

{{blockquote|In the studio it was great, and on the day it came out it was great. It was only when I got on tour that I was thinking, "It doesn't fucking stand up."&nbsp;... People are prepared to have stand-up rows with me in the street: "I fucking love that album!" And I'm like, "Mate, look, I wrote the fucking thing. I know how much effort I put into it. It wasn't that much."<ref>{{cite news |title=Noel Gallagher has a lot of regrets about 'Be Here Now' |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallagher-oasis-be-here-now-regret-2153551 |access-date=5 April 2020 |work=NME |archive-date=20 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020062702/https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallagher-oasis-be-here-now-regret-2153551 |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

{{Quote box
| quote =For a little while, ''Be Here Now'' demanded superlatives. Its path was paved with five-star reviews, like petals thrown beneath a Roman emperor's feet. No album in history has experienced such a swift and dramatic reversal of fortune. ''Be Here Now'' was reframed first as a disappointment and then as a disaster. It burned out quickly, falling well short of the sales achieved by 1995's ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'', with many copies ending up in secondhand racks. Noel himself quickly disowned it, dismissing it in the 2003 Britpop documentary ''[[Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop|Live Forever]]'' as "the sound of five men in the studio, on coke, not giving a fuck".

Noel had been ambivalent about the album in pre-release interviews, telling ''[[NME]]'', "This record ain't going to surprise many people." However, there was nobody around him to echo his reservations. "Everyone's going: 'It's brilliant!'" he later said. "And right towards the end, we're doing the mixing and I'm thinking to myself: 'Hmmm, I don't know about this now.'"<ref name="Lynskey"/> When the album was released Oasis were woven into Britain's cultural fabric like no other band since the Beatles, and according to their former press officer Johnny Hopkins: "There were more hangers-on, constantly telling them they were the greatest thing. That tended to block out the critical voices."<ref name="Lynskey"/> Dorian Lynskey writes, "If it couldn't be Britpop's zenith, then it must be the nadir. It can't be just a collection of songs – some good, some bad, most too long, all insanely overproduced – but an emblem of the hubris before the fall, like a dictator's statue pulled to the ground by a vengeful mob."<ref name="Lynskey"/>

After the conclusion of the [[Be Here Now Tour]] in early 1998, amidst much media criticism, the group kept a low profile. Later in the year, Oasis released a compilation album of fourteen B-sides, ''[[The Masterplan (Oasis album)|The Masterplan]]''. "The really interesting stuff from around that period is the B-sides. There's a lot more inspired music on the B-sides than there is on ''Be Here Now'' itself, I think," said Noel in an interview in 2008.<ref>[http://www.thewavemag.com/pagegen.php?pagename=article&articleid=26083 Wave Magazine News article].

===1999–2001: Line-up change and ''Standing on the Shoulder of Giants''===
In early 1999, the band began work on their fourth studio album. First details were announced in February, with [[Mark Stent]] revealed to be taking a co-producing role. Things were not going well and the shock departure of founding member [[Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs]] was announced in August. This departure was reported at the time as amicable, with Noel stating Arthurs wanted to spend more time with his family. Arthurs' statement clarified his leaving as "to concentrate on other things".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/415855.stm|title=Gallagher shrugs off Oasis departure|work=BBC News|date=10 August 1999|access-date=9 March 2008|archive-date=12 November 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112142225/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/415855.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> However, Noel has since offered a contradicting version: that a series of violations of Noel's "no drink or drugs" policy (imposed by Noel so that Liam could sing properly) for the album's sessions resulted in a confrontation between the two.<ref name="book">{{Cite book| author=St. Michael, Mick | title=Oasis: In Their Own Words | publisher=Omnibus Pr | year=1996 | isbn=0-7119-5695-2}}</ref> Two weeks later the departure of bassist [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul McGuigan]] was announced.

After the completion of the recording sessions, the band began searching for replacement members. The first new member to be announced was new lead/rhythm guitarist [[Gem Archer|Colin "Gem" Archer]], formerly of [[Heavy Stereo]], who later claimed to have been approached by Noel Gallagher only a couple of days after Arthurs' departure was publicly announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mad4gem.tripod.com/biography.htm|title=tripod.com|publisher=Mad4gem.tripod.com|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-date=30 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730165249/http://mad4gem.tripod.com/biography.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Finding a replacement bassist took more time and effort: the band were rehearsing with David Potts, but he quickly resigned, and they brought in [[Andy Bell (Welsh musician)|Andy Bell]], former guitarist/songwriter of [[Ride (band)|Ride]] and [[Hurricane No. 1|Hurricane #1]] as their new bassist. Bell had never played bass before and had to learn to play it (with Noel since saying, "I was amazed that Andy was up for actually playing the bass y'know, cos he's such a good guitarist"), along with a handful of songs from Oasis's back catalogue, in preparation for a scheduled US tour in December 1999.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Randall |first1=Lucian |title=Noel Gallagher – The Biography |date=2012 |publisher=Kings Road Publishing}}</ref>

With the folding of [[Creation Records]], Oasis formed their own label, [[Big Brother Recordings|Big Brother]], which released all of Oasis's subsequent records in the UK and Ireland. Oasis's fourth album, ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'', was released in February 2000 to good first-week sales. It reached number one on the British charts and peaked at number&nbsp;24 on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref>[http://www.oasisinet.com/site.php?site=album&atype=0&country=172&idx=19 Oasis – Official Website – Discography] retrieved on 15 December 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011005304/http://www.oasisinet.com/site.php?site=album&atype=0&country=172&idx=19 |date=11 October 2007 }}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=oasis|chart=all}} Billboard.com – Discography – Oasis – Standing on the Shoulders of Giants]{{dead link|date=February 2011}} retrieved on 15 December 2007</ref> Four singles were released from the album: "[[Go Let It Out]]", "[[Who Feels Love?]]", "[[Sunday Morning Call]]" and "[[Where Did It All Go Wrong?]]", of which the first three were top five UK singles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/|title=Top 40 Singles|publisher=Thetop40charts.co.uk|access-date=28 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016220614/http://www.thetop40charts.co.uk/top40/|archive-date=16 October 2015}}</ref>  The "Go Let It Out" music video was shot before Bell joined the group and therefore featured the unusual line-up of Liam on rhythm guitar, Archer on lead guitar and Noel on bass. With the departure of the founding members, the band made several small changes to their image and sound. The cover featured a new "Oasis" logo, designed by Gem Archer, and the album was also the first Oasis release to include a song written by [[Liam Gallagher]], entitled "Little James". The songs also had more experimental, psychedelic influences.<ref name="allmusicstanding">[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r466450|pure_url=yes}} Standing on the Shoulders of Giants > Overview ].

To support the record the band staged an eventful world tour. While touring in [[Barcelona]] in 2000, Oasis were forced to cancel a gig when an attack of [[tendinitis]] caused [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan White]]'s arm to seize up, and the band spent the night drinking instead. After a row between the two brothers, Noel declared he was quitting touring overseas altogether, and Oasis were supposed to finish the tour without him.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/760729.stm|title=Oasis Noel quits tour|work=BBC News|date=23 May 2000|access-date=15 December 2007|archive-date=1 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901184211/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/760729.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> Noel eventually returned for the Irish and British legs of the tour, which included two major shows at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

===2001–2003: ''Heathen Chemistry''===
[[File:Oasis-band-concert-Montreal-Canada-Aug2002.jpg|thumb|Oasis performing in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2002]]
Throughout 2001, Oasis split time between sessions for their fifth studio album and live shows around the world. Gigs included the month-long [[Tour of Brotherly Love]] with [[the Black Crowes]] and [[Spacehog]] and a show in Paris supporting [[Neil Young]]. The album, ''[[Heathen Chemistry]]'', Oasis's first album with new members Andy Bell and Gem Archer, was released in July 2002. The album reached number&nbsp;1 in the UK and number&nbsp;23 in the US,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2113780.stm|title=Elvis and Oasis enjoy chart success|work=BBC News|date=7 July 2002|access-date=14 December 2007|archive-date=3 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203133228/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2113780.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r595973|pure_url=yes}} Heathen Chemistry > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums].

The record blended the band's sonic experiments from their last albums, but also went for a more basic rock sound.<ref name="allmusicheathen"/> The recording of ''Heathen Chemistry'' was much more balanced for the band, with all of the members, apart from White, writing songs. [[Johnny Marr]] provided additional guitar as well as backup vocals on a couple of songs.

After the album's release, the band embarked on a successful world tour that was once again filled with incidents. In August 2002, while the band were on tour in the US, Noel, Bell and touring keyboardist [[Jay Darlington]] were involved in a car accident in Indianapolis. While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result. In December 2002, the latter half of the German leg of the band's European tour had to be postponed after Liam Gallagher, Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage were arrested after a violent brawl at a [[Munich]] nightclub. The band had been drinking heavily and tests showed that Liam had used cocaine.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3685545.stm|title=Brawling Oasis singer 'on drugs'|work=BBC News|date=5 May 2004|access-date=9 March 2008|archive-date=20 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620041739/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3685545.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> Liam lost two front teeth and kicked a police officer in the ribs, while Alan suffered minor head injuries after getting hit with an [[ashtray]].<ref name="Scotsman">{{cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2383329|title=Oasis singer could face jail for bar brawl|work=The Scotsman|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-date=17 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817034301/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2383329|url-status=live}}</ref> Two years later Liam was fined around £40,000.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20041123/ai_n12823072 Independent News article] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217191717/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20041123/ai_n12823072 |date=17 December 2007 }}.

Starkey played publicly for the first time at [[The Lighthouse (Poole)|Poole Lighthouse]].

A few days later, Oasis, with Starkey, headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival]] for the second time in their career and performed a largely greatest hits set, which included two new songs—Gem Archer's "A Bell Will Ring" and Liam Gallagher's "The Meaning of Soul".

After much turbulence, the band's sixth album was finally recorded in Los Angeles–based Capitol Studios from October to December the same year. Producer [[Dave Sardy]] took over the lead producing role from Noel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kathyszaksite.com/oasis20042.html|title=Zak Starkey fan site|publisher=Kathyszaksite.com|access-date=28 September 2014|archive-date=21 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121110849/http://www.kathyszaksite.com/oasis20042.html|url-status=live}}</ref> who decided to step back from these duties after a decade of producing leadership over the band. In May 2005, after three years and as many scrapped recording sessions, the band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'', fulfilling their contract with [[Sony BMG]].

In May 2005, the band's new line-up embarked on a large scale world tour. Beginning on 10 May 2005 at the [[London Astoria]], and finishing on 31 March 2006 in front of a sold-out gig in [[Mexico City]], Oasis played more live shows than at any time since the Definitely Maybe Tour, visiting 26 countries and headlining 113 shows for over 3.2&nbsp;million people. The tour passed without any major incidents and was the band's most successful in more than a decade. The tour included sold-out shows at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] and LA's [[Hollywood Bowl]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/06/04/bmoasis2.xml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011190141/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2005%2F06%2F04%2Fbmoasis2.xml|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 October 2007|title=Back in anger (...continued)|work=The Telegraph|date=4 June 2005|last=McLean|first=Craig|access-date=9 March 2008|location=London}}</ref> A [[rockumentary]] film made during the tour, entitled ''[[Lord Don't Slow Me Down]]'' directed by [[Baillie Walsh]] was released in October 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oasis announce details of 'Lord Don't Slow Me Down' DVD |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/news/oasis-announce-details-of-lord-don-t-slow-me-down-dvd-60702/ |access-date=1 September 2024 |work=Uncut}}</ref>

===2007–2009: ''Dig Out Your Soul''===
[[File:Noel Gallagher playing Champagne Supernova.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Noel Gallagher playing live at the [[Bell Centre]], Montreal in 2008]]
The band's resurgence in popularity since the success of ''Don't Believe the Truth'' was highlighted in February 2008 when, in a poll to find the fifty greatest British albums of the last fifty years conducted by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine and [[HMV]], two Oasis albums were voted first and second (''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' and ''[[(What's The Story) Morning Glory?]]'' respectively). Two other albums by the band appeared in the list – ''Don't Believe The Truth'' came in at number fourteen, and the album that has previously been heavily criticised by some of the media, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'', made the list at no. 22.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage3.htm#Q |title=Rocklist.net...Q Magazine Lists |publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |access-date=7 February 2011 |archive-date=5 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605073408/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage3.htm#Q |url-status=usurped }}</ref>

Oasis recorded for a couple of months in 2007 – between July and September – completing work on two new songs and demoing the rest. They then took a two-month break because of the birth of Noel's son. The band re-entered the studio on 5 November 2007 and finished recording around March 2008<ref>[http://www.oasisinet.com/site.php?site=news&idx=759 Oasis Net news article].

In May 2008, [[Zak Starkey]] left the band after recording ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'', the band's seventh studio album. He was replaced by former [[The Icicle Works|Icicle Works]] and [[the La's]] drummer [[Chris Sharrock]] on their tour but Chris was not an official member of the band and Oasis remained as a four-piece. The first single from the record was "[[The Shock of the Lightning]]" written by Noel Gallagher, and was pre-released on 29 September 2008. ''Dig Out Your Soul'', the band's seventh studio album, was released on 6 October and went to number&nbsp;one in the UK and number&nbsp;five on the ''Billboard'' 200. The band started touring for a projected 18-month-long tour expected to last till September 2009, with support from [[Kasabian]], [[The Enemy (UK rock band)|the Enemy]] and [[Twisted Wheel (band)|Twisted Wheel]].<ref name="tourdates">{{cite web|title=Oasis tour dates|url=http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/108/Oasis.html|access-date=3 January 2009|archive-date=20 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220220306/http://www.ents24.com/web/artist/108/Oasis.html|url-status=live}}</ref> On 7 September 2008, while performing at [[Virgin Festival]] in Toronto, a member of the audience ran on stage and physically assaulted Noel.<ref name="Attack!">Thompson, Robert.

Okereke visibly derived pleasure from informing the audience of the band's withdrawal from the festival, joking: "I guess by default, we are headlining." Bloc Party guitarist [[Russell Lissack]] also mockingly played the opening riff to the Oasis track "[[Supersonic (Oasis song)|Supersonic]]." Before playing the Bloc Party song "[[Mercury (song)|Mercury]]," Okereke told the audience: "I'd like to dedicate this next song to anyone who really wanted to see those inbred twins."

By early 2023, both Gallagher brothers expressed interest in reuniting the band if it was done on the right terms. During Liam's ''Definitely Maybe'' 30th anniversary tour in 2024, Liam reserved a seat for Noel at every gig. On 27 August 2024, almost 15 years to the date of their 2009 split, Oasis announced that they had reformed and would perform in the UK and Ireland in July and August 2025, stating: "The guns have fallen silent.

==Legal battles over songwriter credits==
Legal action has been taken against Noel Gallagher and Oasis for [[plagiarism]] on three occasions. The first was the case of [[Neil Innes]] (formerly of the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] and [[the Rutles]]) suing to prove the Oasis song "[[Whatever (Oasis song)|Whatever]]" borrowed from his song "How Sweet to Be an Idiot". Innes was eventually awarded royalties and a co-writer credit.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/06/oasis.accused.plagiarism.cliff.richard|title=Have Oasis plagiarised Cliff Richard?|author=Sean Michaels|work=The Guardian|date=6 October 2008|access-date=8 September 2015|archive-date=20 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920053949/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/06/oasis.accused.plagiarism.cliff.richard|url-status=live}}</ref> Noel Gallagher said in 2010 that the plagiarism was unintentional and he was unaware of the similarities until informed of Innes's legal case.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Incr7Z3kQ |title=Whatever – 'Time Flies...1994–2009' Clip |via=YouTube |date=19 May 2010 |access-date=7 February 2011 |archive-date=13 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713070936/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Incr7Z3kQ&feature=related |url-status=live }}</ref> In the second incident, Oasis were sued by [[Coca-Cola]] and forced to pay $500,000 in damages to [[the New Seekers]] after it was alleged that the Oasis song  "[[Shakermaker]]" had lifted words and melody from "[[I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (in Perfect Harmony)|I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing]]".<ref name="guardian" /> When asked about the incident, Noel Gallagher joked "Now we all drink [[Pepsi]]."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/oasis/news/artists/8865/55193/55218 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609014904/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/oasis/news/artists/8865/55193/55218 |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 June 2010 |title=Oasis &#124; Rolling Stone Music |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=7 February 2011}}</ref> On the third and final occasion, when promotional copies of ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' were originally distributed, they contained a previously unreleased bonus song called "Step Out".

==Legacy==
[[File:Oasis Liam and Noel.jpg|thumb|The Gallagher brothers in 2005]]
Despite originally parting ways in 2009, Oasis remain influential in British music and culture and are recognised as one of the biggest and most acclaimed bands of the 1990s. Yardbarker wrote, "Oasis was known as much for the antics and often volatile relationship between brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher as [it was for its] stellar alternative/pop rock sound. When the two were on, in sync, relatively sober, and not totally at each other's throats, Oasis was tough to beat. And when the tension was high, the band still delivered some of the best music of the 1990s."<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 January 2025 |title=The 25 most legendary bands to hail from England |url=https://www.yardbarker.com/entertainment/articles/the_25_greatest_english_rock_bands/s1__30317819#slide_14 |access-date=10 February 2025 |website=Yardbarker}}</ref>

Additionally, the band are recognised as one of the spearheads of [[Britpop]], which has claimed a prominent place in British music.<ref name="allmusic.com"/> With their high record sales, concerts, sibling disputes, and their [[Britpop#"The Battle of Britpop"|high-profile chart battle]] with Britpop rivals [[Blur (band)|Blur]], Oasis were a major part of 1990s UK pop culture, an era dubbed

The band's success also helped local businesses. Pete Caban, owner of Bandwagon Music Supplies in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland, which closed in 2020 after 37 years in business, said: "The highlight years were the mid-90s to the early 2000s. That was the peak period. The Oasis period, as I call it, where everyone wanted to buy a guitar. That was the game changer for music and for me here in Perth. I was shovelling guitars out the door at the point. So hurrah for Noel Gallagher."<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1485442/photo-and-council-update-perth-music-shop-to-shut-after-four-decades-as-owner-blames-years-of-delayed-works-at-city-centre-landmark/ "Perth music shop to shut after four decades as owner blames years of delayed works at city centre landmark"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210128162304/https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1485442/photo-and-council-update-perth-music-shop-to-shut-after-four-decades-as-owner-blames-years-of-delayed-works-at-city-centre-landmark/ |date=28 January 2021 }} – ''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 4 August 2020</ref>

In 2023, an unofficial music project by the name of AISIS was the first full-length album to use [[Artificial intelligence]] (AI) vocals. The project attracted more than half a million views within six weeks of publication, including newspaper articles written about it,{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}} and brought Breezer, the band that created the project, out of obscurity and landed them live dates.<ref>{{Cite news |title='We got bored waiting for Oasis to re-form': AIsis, the band fronted by an AI Liam Gallagher |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/18/oasis-aisis-band-fronted-by-an-ai-liam-gallagher |access-date=2 June 2023 |date=18 April 2023 }}</ref> Bobby Geraghty and his Breezer bandmates wrote original Oasis-style songs and then used AI to create [[audio deepfake]]s based on Liam Gallagher's voice alongside their original instrumentation. Liam himself approved of the album, saying that he "sounded mega".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Reilly |first=Nick |date=19 April 2023 |title=Liam Gallagher responds to AI Oasis album: 'I sound mega!' |url=https://www.rollingstone.co.uk/music/news/liam-gallagher-responds-to-ai-oasis-album-i-sound-mega-28580/ |access-date=2 June 2023 |magazine=Rolling Stone UK}}</ref>

Oasis received a nomination for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on their sixth year of eligibility in February 2024. Initially, the members included in the nomination were the Gallagher brothers, McGuigan, White, Arthurs, McCarroll, Archer, and Bell. Liam Gallagher feels that the organisation is not authentic when it comes to rock music.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Legaspi |first1=Althea |title=Liam Gallagher Slams Rock Hall of Fame After Oasis Nomination: 'There's Something Very Fishy About Those Awards' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/liam-gallagher-oasis-roll-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nomination-reaction-1234966803/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=12 February 2024 |access-date=11 October 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/oasis |title=Oasis Biography |website=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=10 February 2024}}</ref>

=== Cultural and academic impact ===
Music sociologist Andy Bennett describes Oasis as "the sonic voice of Northern pride in a time of cultural centralization".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bennett |first=Andy |title=Cultures of popular music |location=Buckingham, England; Philadelphia |publisher=Open University Press |year=2001 |isbn=9780335202515}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2025}} Their use of regional accents, lyrical themes, and public personas resonated with disaffected youth, especially in industrial cities. The band's fashion—parkas, trainers, and mod haircuts—helped solidify a subcultural identity later studied in fashion sociology.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Woodward |first=Sophie |date=2009-03-01 |title=The Myth of Street Style |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175174109X381355 |journal=Fashion Theory |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=83–101 |doi=10.2752/175174109X381355 |issn=1362-704X|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

Academic analyses have also focused on their gender performance and stage dynamics. Neil Nehring suggests that Liam Gallagher's performance style mixed rebellion and introspection, presenting a hybrid form of postmodern masculinity.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Neil |first=Nehring |title=Popular music, gender, and postmodernism : anger is an energy |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif. |publisher=Sage Publications |year=1997 |isbn=9781506339207}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2025}} Meanwhile, Noel Gallagher's songwriting has been the subject of literary analysis, with researchers noting his use of anthemic choruses and nostalgic lyricism as devices of collective memory.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shuker |first=Roy |url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781134564804 |title=Understanding Popular Music |date=2013-01-11 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-56480-4 |edition=0 |language=en |doi=10.4324/9780203188019}}</ref>

Historian Keith Gildart contends that Oasis embodied the voice of post-industrial, working-class youth in Britain. Their music captured everyday realities and aspirations, fostering a deep cultural resonance that contributed to the band's enduring nostalgic value for a generation that came of age during significant social and economic transformation.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Keith |first=Gildart |title=Images of England Through Popular Music: Class, Youth and Rock 'n' Roll |date=16 October 2013 |location=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=9780230019690}}</ref> Their albums—especially ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?''—are often cited in academic literature about emotional resonance and branding in music.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Simon |first=Frith |title=Performing Rites: On the Value of Popular Music |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780674661967}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2025}}
