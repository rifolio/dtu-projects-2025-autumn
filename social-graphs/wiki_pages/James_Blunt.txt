In 1999, Blunt volunteered to join a [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of the [[Blues and Royals]] who deployed with [[NATO]] to [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|Kosovo]].<ref>{{cite news |title=NATO Occupies Tense Kosovo Capital |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/kosovo061399.htm |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=6 December 2015 |date=13 June 1999 |first=Michael |last=Dobbs}}</ref> Initially assigned to carry out [[reconnaissance]] of the [[North Macedonia|Macedonia]]–[[Serbia and Montenegro|FR Yugoslavia]] border, Blunt's [[troop]] worked ahead of the front lines, locating and targeting [[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Serbian]] forces for the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing campaign]]. On 12 June 1999, the troop led the 30,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force from the Macedonia border towards [[Pristina International Airport]]. However, [[Incident at Pristina Airport|a Russian military contingent had moved in and taken control of the airport]] before his unit's arrival.

While still in the army, Blunt would write songs during his time off. A backing vocalist and songwriting collaborator suggested he contact [[Elton John]]'s manager, Todd Interland, with whom she used to share a house. Interland told [[HitQuarters]] that he listened to Blunt's demo while driving home and, after hearing the track "Goodbye My Lover", pulled over and called the mobile number written on the CD to set up a meeting.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_InterlandT.html |title=Interview with Todd Interland |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=29 August 2005 |access-date=24 June 2012}}</ref>

Blunt left the British Army in 2002 so that he could pursue his musical career.<ref name="GW 2006"/> He started using the stage name "[[I, James Blunt|James Blunt]]" in part to make it easier for others to spell; "Blount" is pronounced the same way, and remains his legal last name.<ref name = "RS Feb06">{{cite magazine |first=Austin |last=Scaggs |title=Q&A |magazine=Rolling Stone |page=28 |date=9 February 2006}}</ref> Shortly after leaving the army he was signed to [[EMI]] [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishers]] and to Twenty-First Artists management.<ref name = "Billboard 2007">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Poletta |title=James Blunt – Beautiful and the Beat |work=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] |pages=26–29 |date=21 July 2007}}</ref> A [[record contract]] remained elusive, with label executives pointing to his [[wikt:posh|posh]] speaking voice as a barrier in class-divided Britain.<ref name = "PS Blunt"/> [[Linda Perry]], who was just launching her own label [[Custard Records]] in early 2003, heard Blunt's promotional tape when visiting London, and soon after heard him perform live at the [[SXSW|South by Southwest Music Festival]].<ref name="Grdn2020"/> She made an offer to him the same night,<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_LindaPerry.html |title=Interview with Linda Perry |work=HitQuarters.com |access-date=5 January 2006}}</ref> and within a few days he signed a recording contract with her.

===2003–2006: ''Back to Bedlam''===
{{Main|Back to Bedlam}}
[[File:James-Blunt2.jpg|thumb|upright|Blunt performing in the United States, 2008]]
Blunt recorded ''[[Back to Bedlam]]'' in 2003 with Rothrock as producer in [[Conway Recording Studios]] at Rothrock's home studio in Los Angeles, playing many instruments himself.<ref name="PS Blunt"/><ref name="Album">[[Back to Bedlam]] album liner notes, Atlantic Records, October 2004</ref> During recording, he lodged with actress [[Carrie Fisher]]. Fisher contributed in naming the album, and he recorded the song "[[Goodbye My Lover]]" in her bathroom.<ref name = "Telegraph"/> ''Back to Bedlam'' was released in the UK in October 2004.

Blunt's debut single in the UK was "[[High (James Blunt song)|High]]" (co-written with [[Ricky Ross (musician)|Ricky Ross]] of [[Deacon Blue]]). This song initially peaked below the Top 100 of the [[UK Singles Chart]]; after the subsequent success of "[[You're Beautiful]]" it made the Top 75 before being re-released.<ref name = "Billboard 2005">{{cite news |first=Margo |last=Whitmire |author2=Emmanuel Legrand |title=Blunt's Journey |work=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] |page=31 |date=17 September 2005}}</ref> The song was chosen to appear in a [[Vodafone]] commercial in Italy, and was a Top 10 hit in that country.<ref name="Billboard 2007"/>

The debut album from the unknown Blunt initially attracted little critical attention; there were no published reviews from major UK music journals. His live performances, mainly in support of better-known musicians, received generally favourable reviews. His lack of performing experience and inconsistent approach with audiences was commented upon, while his music was likened to that of [[Damien Rice]] and [[David Gray (British musician)|David Gray]].<ref name="Rescue Rooms">{{cite web |last=Allcock |first=Anthony |title=James Blunt at Rescue Rooms |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) |date=7 November 2004 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2004/11/08/entertainment_music_event_reviews_2004_11_james_blunt_feature.shtml |access-date=10 February 2008}}</ref><ref name="93 Feet East">{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Mugan |title=James Blunt, 93 Feet East, London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/james-blunt-93-feet-east-london-486079.html |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=10 January 2005 |access-date=10 February 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Blunt's third single, "You're Beautiful", was his break-out hit.<ref name="Grdn2020"/> The song debuted at number 12 in the UK, and reached number one six weeks later.

The song was released to radio stations in the autumn of 2005 and climbed into the Top 10 in three radio formats: [[Adult Contemporary Music]], [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks]], and [[Adult album alternative]].<ref name = "Billboard 2007"/>

Blunt became the first British artist to top the American singles chart in nearly a decade when "You're Beautiful" reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 2006; the last British artist to do so had been [[Elton John]] in 1997 with the song "[[Candle in the Wind 1997]]".<ref name="Billboard 2007"/>
"Goodbye My Lover" was released as the fourth UK single from the album in December 2005, and the second US single. The songs "High" and "Wisemen" were subsequently re-released in 2006. Blunt began 2006 celebrating five [[Brit Award]] nominations, and went on to win Best British male solo artist and Best pop act categories, having already started an 11-month world tour.<ref name="NME Jan06">{{cite web |title=Kaiser Chiefs lead Brit Award nominations |work=NME |location=UK Magazine |publisher=IPC Media |date=10 January 2006 |url=https://www.nme.com/news/kaiser-chiefs/21923 |access-date=12 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104020802/http://www.nme.com/news/kaiser-chiefs/21923 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=4 January 2008}}</ref> On 31 August 2006, he won two awards at the [[2006 MTV Video Music Awards]], with "You're Beautiful" winning the award for Best Male Video.<ref>{{cite web |title=Video Music Awards Winners By Category |url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/archive/winners-by-category.jhtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130717231149/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/archive/winners-by-category.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 July 2013 |website=MTV Video Music Awards |access-date=9 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2006/mtvvmas.htm |last=Rock on the Net |title=2006 MTV Video Music Awards |year=2022 |access-date=15 January 2022}}</ref>

In late 2005, Blunt made appearances on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' and as a musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Eight of the songs on the album were featured in television shows (''[[The O.C.]]'', ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' and many more), films (''[[Undiscovered (film)|Undiscovered]]''), and advertising campaigns ([[Hilton Hotels]], [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] telecommunications) throughout 2005 and 2006.<ref name = "Billboard 2007"/> He performed "You're Beautiful" at the [[49th Grammy Awards]] in February 2007, dedicating the song to the late [[Ahmet Ertegün]] of [[Atlantic Records]], but he did not win in any of the five categories for which he had received nominations (including [[Best New Artist]], won by [[Carrie Underwood]]).<ref name="Grammy">{{cite web |title=49th Annual Grammy Awards Winners List |publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences |date=11 February 2007 |url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx |access-date=12 February 2008 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20091108091302/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx |archive-date=8 November 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2005, Blunt performed 90 live shows, mainly across the UK and Europe, and supported [[Jason Mraz]] in a North American tour. The "Back to Bedlam World Tour" started off in January 2006, covering cities in Europe, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, as well as three separate headline tours in North America, ending in November of that year.<ref name="tour"/> Not including promotional appearances, he performed over 140 live shows in 2006.

The videos for all of Blunt's singles from ''Back To Bedlam'' feature symbolism and dark imagery. In the first video for "High", he is buried in a desert. In the first video for "Wisemen", he is kidnapped and taken hostage. In the video for "You're Beautiful", he alludes to suicide by jumping off a cliff into the sea. In the "[[Goodbye My Lover]]" video, he is the outsider in a love triangle, imagining the couple, a man and woman (played by [[Matt Dallas]] of ''[[Kyle XY]]'' and [[Mischa Barton]] of ''[[The O.C.]]'') together. The re-release video for "High" features Blunt running in a forest. The re-release video for "Wisemen" has him burning identification papers, and then walking through a forest while he is on fire.

Blunt appeared on an episode of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' which aired on 14 November 2007, singing about triangles to the tune of "You're Beautiful".<ref name="LiveDaily">{{cite web |title=LiveDaily Interview: James Blunt |website=LiveDaily.com |publisher=[[IAC/InterActiveCorp|IAC]] |date=27 September 2007 |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/12879.html |access-date=1 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027004249/http://www.livedaily.com/news/12879.html |archive-date=27 October 2008}}</ref> A parody of "You're Beautiful" titled "[[You're Pitiful]]" was recorded by [[Weird Al Yankovic]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Stephen |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5482774 |title=Free 'Weird Al' Yankovic! |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=13 June 2006 |access-date=29 April 2012}}</ref> According to Yankovic, Blunt gave his personal permission for the parody to be included on a Weird Al album before it was formally recorded,<!-- in the source, permission is described first, and then the company blocked the release "after Yankovic finished recording the parody". --> but [[Atlantic Records]], Blunt's label, stepped in to forbid the commercial release of the song.

While Blunt's first album received little critical attention, critics from every major music publication, and newspapers around the world, weighed in on ''All the Lost Souls''.<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web |title=''All the Lost Souls'' aggregated reviews |publisher=Metacritic |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/bluntjames/allthelostsouls |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003085146/http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/bluntjames/allthelostsouls |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 October 2007 |access-date=21 June 2008}}</ref> The album was met with generally mixed to positive reviews, and received a 53/100 rating at [[Metacritic]].<ref name="Metacritic" /> Eric Danton, of the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' and ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' wrote that the album is "a collection so bland, it makes [[hardtack]] seem sumptuous".

The first single from ''All the Lost Souls'', "1973", was inspired by Blunt's nights out at [[Pacha Group|Pacha]], an [[Ibiza]] club, which opened in that year.

Blunt collaborated twice during this album cycle. In late 2007, he worked with French rapper [[Sinik]]. They released "Je Réalise", which took elements of Blunt's song "I'll Take Everything", which hit the top three in France. On 14 November 2008, "[[Primavera in anticipo]]", [[Laura Pausini]]'s new album, was released. The title track is a duet with Blunt. The album reached the Number one in Italy.

Throughout 2007 and 2008, Blunt went on his second world tour, including a performance in London's [[The O2 (London)|O2 Arena]]. In July and August 2008, he supported [[Sheryl Crow]] on a 25-date tour along with [[Toots and the Maytals]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://people.com/celebrity/sheryl-crow-preps-for-life-on-the-road-with-baby-wyatt/ |title=Sheryl Crow Preps for Life on the Road with Baby Wyatt |website=People |access-date=23 September 2023}}</ref> On 24 November 2008, ''All The Lost Souls'' was re-released as a deluxe edition, with new album artwork, new single "[[Love, Love, Love (James Blunt song)|Love, Love, Love]]" and the documentary ''[[James Blunt: Return to Kosovo]]''.
