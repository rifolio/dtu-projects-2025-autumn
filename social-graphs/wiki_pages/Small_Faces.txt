'''Small Faces''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[London]], founded in 1965. The group originally consisted of [[Steve Marriott]], [[Ronnie Lane]], [[Kenney Jones]] and [[Jimmy Winston]], with [[Ian McLagan]] replacing Winston as the band's [[keyboardist]] in 1966.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|title=The Small Faces Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5461/biography|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2011-01-28}}</ref> The band were one of the most acclaimed and influential [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] groups of the 1960s,<ref name="acesandeighths">{{cite web|title=Influential Rock Musicians 1962–1969 British Invasion|publisher=Aces and Eighths|url=http://www.acesandeighths.com/Rock_performers62_69.html#faces|access-date=2011-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222013426/http://www.acesandeighths.com/Rock_performers62_69.html#faces|archive-date=22 February 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="rollingstone">{{cite magazine|title=Faces Biography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/faces/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114141601/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/faces/biography|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 January 2012|access-date=2011-01-29}}</ref> recording [[Chart-topper|hit songs]] such as "[[Itchycoo Park]]", "[[Lazy Sunday (Small Faces song)|Lazy Sunday]]", "[[All or Nothing (Small Faces song)|All or Nothing]]" and "[[Tin Soldier (song)|Tin Soldier]]", as well as their [[concept album]] ''[[Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake]]''.

When Marriott left to form [[Humble Pie]], the remaining three members collaborated with [[Ronnie Wood]], Wood's older brother [[Art Wood]], [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Kim Gardner]], briefly continuing under the name Quiet Melon, and then, with the departure of Art Wood and Gardner, as the [[Faces (band)|Faces]].<ref name="allmusic2">{{cite web|title=Faces Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4218/biography|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2011-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Buckley|page=351|year=2003|title=The rough guide to rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haEfq-nKqjgC&q=small+faces++1975+rough+guide+to+rock&pg=PR7-IA297|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=9781572308268}}</ref> In North America, the Faces' debut album was credited to Small Faces.

==History==

===Origins (1965)===
[[File:Small Faces 1965.JPG|left|thumb|Small Faces in 1965 (left to right) Marriott, Lane, Jones and Winston]]

==== Meeting of Lane and Marriott (1965) ====
Lane and Marriott met in 1965, while Marriott was working at the J60 Music Bar in [[Manor Park, London]].<ref name="makingtime">{{cite web|title=Small Faces Story Part 2|publisher=Making Time – Guide to British Music of the 1960s|url=http://www.makingtime.co.uk/rfr/story2.htm|access-date=2011-01-30}}</ref> Lane came in with his father Stan to buy a bass guitar, struck up a conversation with Marriott, bought the bass and went back to Marriott's house after work to listen to records.<ref name="makingtime"/> They recruited friends Kenny Jones and Jimmy Winston who switched from guitar to the organ.<ref name="makingtime"/> They rapidly progressed from rehearsals at The Ruskin Arms public house (which was owned by Winston's parents) in Manor Park, London, to ramshackle pub gigs, to semi-professional club dates. The group chose the name, "Small Faces", because of the members' small physical stature<ref name="makingtime"/> and a "face" was somebody special; more than just a snappy dresser, he was someone in mod circles as a leader, someone to look up to. A face had the sharpest clothes, the best records, and always was seen with the prettiest girl on his arm.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hellier|first=John|title=Here Come the Nice: A Small Faces Songbook|year=2005|publisher=Helter Skelter|isbn=1-905139-12-8|pages=7}}</ref>

==== Early stage performances (1965) ====
The band's early song set included R&B/soul classics such as "[[Jump Back]]", [[James Brown]]'s "Please Please Please", [[Smokey Robinson]]'s "[[You've Really Got a Hold on Me]]" and [[Ben E. King]]'s "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]".<ref name="makingtime"/> The band also performed two Marriott/Lane original compositions, a fast and loud "Come on Children" and the "[[speed (drug)|speed]] enhanced" song "E too D", in which Marriott would display his considerable vocal abilities in the style of his heroes and role models, [[Otis Redding]] and [[Bobby Bland]]. "E too D", which appears on their first album, ''[[Small Faces (1966 album)|Small Faces]]'', is named after the guitar chord structure. On US compilation albums the track is titled "Running Wild".<ref name="makingtime"/> Marriott's unique and powerful voice attracted rising attention. Singer [[Elkie Brooks]] was struck by Marriott's vocal prowess and stage presence, and recommended them to a local club owner, Maurice King. Impressed, King began finding them work in London and beyond.<ref name="makingtime"/><ref name="makingtime2">{{cite web|title=Small Faces Story Part 3|publisher=Making Time – Guide to British Music of the 1960s|url=http://www.makingtime.co.uk/rfr/story3.htm|access-date=2011-01-30}}</ref> Their first out-of-London concert was at a [[working men's club]] in [[Sheffield]].<ref name="makingtime2"/> Since the crowd was mainly made up of [[Teddy boy]]s and hard-drinking workers, the band were paid off after three songs.<ref name="makingtime2"/> Despondent, they walked into the mod-orientated [[King Mojo Club]] nearby (then owned by [[Peter Stringfellow]]) and offered to perform for free.<ref name="bib">{{cite web|title=Small Faces|publisher=British Invasion Bands|url=http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/small-faces/|access-date=2011-01-30|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214152726/http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/small-faces/|archive-date=14 February 2011}}</ref> They played a set that left the local mods wanting more. During a crucial residency at Leicester Square's Cavern Club, they were supported by [[Sonny & Cher]], who were living in London at the time.<ref name="bbc3">{{cite news|title=The Small Faces – the Band|work=[[BBC Online]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A9370415|access-date=2011-01-30}}</ref>

=== Decca years (1965–67) ===

====Signing to Decca and first two singles (1965)====
{{Main|Whatcha Gonna Do About It|I've Got Mine}}
The band signed a management contract with management impresario [[Don Arden]], and they were in turn signed to [[Decca Records]] for recording.<ref name="allmusic"/> They released a string of high-energy mod/soul singles on the label. Their debut single was in 1965 with "[[Whatcha Gonna Do About It]]", a Top 20 [[UK singles chart]] hit.<ref name="allmusic"/> Marriott and Lane are credited with creating the instrumental to the song, "borrowing" the guitar [[riff]] from the [[Solomon Burke]] record "[[Everybody Needs Somebody to Love]]".<ref name="allmusic"/> The lyrics were co-written by the Drifters band member [[Ian Samwell]] (who wrote one of the first British [[rock'n'roll]] records, "[[Move It]]") and [[Brian Potter (musician)|Brian Potter]].<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Hewitt, Hellier|pages=93–94|year=2004|title=All Too Beautiful|publisher=Helter Skelter Publishing|title-link=Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...}}</ref>

The group failed to capitalise on the success of their first single with the follow-up, which was written by Marriott/Lane, the hard-edged mod number "[[I've Got Mine]]".<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="bbc3"/> The band appeared as themselves in a 1965 [[crime film]] titled ''[[Dateline Diamonds]]'' starring [[Kenneth Cope]] as the band's manager and it featured the band playing their second single release.<ref name="movie">{{cite web|title=Dateline Diamonds |publisher=The Spinning Image|url=http://www.thespinningimage.co.uk/cultfilms/displaycultfilm.asp?reviewid=1318|access-date=2011-01-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Muise|page=90|year=2002|title=Gallagher, Marriott, Derringer & Trower: their lives and music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JI4LHXgz7YEC&q=Dateline+Diamonds++Small+Faces&pg=PA90|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9780634029561}}</ref><ref name="radio">{{cite web|title=Dateline Diamonds|publisher=Radio London|url=http://radiolondon.co.uk/rl/scrap60/fabforty/65fabs/april66/datelinediamonds.html|access-date=2011-01-30}}</ref> Arden thought the band's song would receive publicity from the film; however, the film's UK release was delayed, and "I've Got Mine" subsequently failed to chart despite receiving good reviews.

Shortly thereafter, Jimmy Winston left the band for an acting and music solo career. He went on to succeed as an actor in TV, film and became a successful business man.<ref name="ianmclagan2">{{cite web|title=Small Faces Talk to You: The Story of the Small Faces in their own Words – Four Small Faces|publisher=Ian McLagan Official Site|url=http://www.ianmclagan.com/sf/four.htm|access-date=2011-01-31|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114134258/http://www.ianmclagan.com/sf/four.htm|archive-date=14 November 2010}}</ref><ref name="allmusic3">{{cite web|title=Jimmy Winston Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p139105/biography|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2011-01-31}}</ref> In a 2000 interview, Kenney Jones said the reason Winston was fired from the band was because "He (Winston) got above his station and tried to compete with Steve Marriott."<ref name="officialfaces">{{cite web|title=Kenney Jones Interview|publisher=the Official Faces Homepage|url=http://www.the-faces.com/kenney/kenint1.htm|access-date=2011-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610215336/http://www.the-faces.com/kenney/kenint1.htm|archive-date=10 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Winston subsequently said he left the group over conflicts between Arden and Winston's brother.<ref>[http://www.wappingwharf.com/winston.htm] {{dead link|date=June 2025}}</ref>

==== ''Small Faces'' and further hit singles (1966) ====
{{Main|Small Faces (1966 album)}}
[[File:SmallFaces1966.png|thumb|Small Faces in 1966]]
Winston was replaced by Ian McLagan, whose keyboard talents and diminutive stature fit with the groove of the band perfectly.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="ianmclagan2"/> McLagan played his first performance with the band on 2 November 1965.<ref>{{Cite book|title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years|last=Tobler|first=John|publisher=Reed International Books Ltd.|year=1992|location=London|page=152|id=CN 5585}}</ref>
The new Small Faces line-up hit the charts with their third single, "[[Sha-La-La-La-Lee]]", released on 28 January 1966.<ref name="allmusic"/> It was written for the group by [[Mort Shuman]] (who wrote many of [[Elvis Presley]]'s biggest singles, including "[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]") and popular English entertainer and singer [[Kenny Lynch]]. The song was a big hit in Britain, peaking at number three in the UK singles chart.<ref name="allmusic"/> Their first album, ''[[Small Faces (1966 album)|Small Faces]]'', released on 6 May 1966, was also a considerable success.<ref name="bbc3"/><ref name="allmusic4">{{cite web|title=The Small Faces Review|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r49569/review|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2011-01-31}}</ref> They rapidly rose in popularity with each chart success, becoming regulars on British pop TV shows such as ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and toured incessantly in the UK and Europe. Their popularity peaked in August 1966, when "[[All or Nothing (Small Faces song)|All or Nothing]]", their fifth single, hit the top of the UK charts.<ref name="bbc3"/> According to Marriott's mother Kay, he is said to have written the song about his breakup with his ex-fiancée Susan Oliver. On the success of "All or Nothing" they were set to tour America with [[the Lovin' Spoonful]] and [[the Mamas & the Papas]], but these plans were shelved by Don Arden after details of Ian McLagan's recent drug conviction were leaked.<ref>{{cite book|author=Twelker, Schmitt|page=42|year=2002|title=The Small Faces & Other Stories|publisher=Bobcat Books}}</ref>

By 1966, despite being one of the highest-grossing live acts in the country and scoring many successful singles, including four UK Top 10 chart hits, the group still had little money. After a confrontation with Arden who tried to face down the boys' parents by claiming that the whole band were using drugs, they broke with both Arden and Decca.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muise|page=91|year=2002|title=Gallagher, Marriott, Derringer & Trower: their lives and music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JI4LHXgz7YEC&q=Small+Faces+Don+Arden&pg=PA89|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9780634029561}}</ref>

===Immediate label years (1967–69)===

==== "Here Come the Nice" and eponymous second album (1967) ====
{{Main|Here Come the Nice|Small Faces (1967 album)}}
They were almost straight away offered a deal with the newly established [[Immediate Records|Immediate]] label, formed by ex-[[Rolling Stones]] manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]].<ref name="allmusic" /> Given a virtual open account at [[Olympic Studios]] in [[Barnes, London]], the band progressed rapidly, working closely with engineer [[Glyn Johns]].<ref name="ianmclagan3">{{cite web|title=Small Faces Talk to You: The Story of the Small Faces in their own Words – Small Faces as Musicians|publisher=Ian McLagan Official Site|url=http://www.ianmclagan.com/sf/musicians.htm|access-date=2011-02-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206130808/http://www.ianmclagan.com/sf/musicians.htm|archive-date=6 February 2011}}</ref> Their first Immediate single was the daring "[[Here Come the Nice]]", which was clearly influenced by their drug use, and managed to escape censorship despite the fact that it openly referred to the dealer who sold drugs.<ref>{{cite book|author=Muise|page=92|year=2002|title=Gallagher, Marriott, Derringer & Trower: their lives and music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JI4LHXgz7YEC&q=%22Here+Come+the+Nice%22+Small+Faces&pg=PA92|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9780634029561}}</ref> A second self-titled album, ''[[Small Faces (Immediate)|Small Faces]]'', followed, which, if not a major seller, was very highly regarded by other musicians and would exert a strong influence on a number of bands both at home and abroad.<ref name="bbc3" />

Three weeks before, their old label, Decca, released the album ''[[From the Beginning (Small Faces album)|From The Beginning]]'', combining old hits with a number of previously unreleased recordings.<ref name="allmusic5">{{cite web|title=From The Beginning Review|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r18281/review|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2011-02-02}}</ref> It included earlier versions of songs they re-recorded for Immediate, including "[[My Way of Giving#Small Faces version|My Way of Giving]]", which they had demoed for [[Chris Farlowe]], and "[[(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me?]]", which they had given to [[Apostolic Intervention]].<ref name="allmusic6">{{cite web|title=Apostolic Intervention Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p385473/biography|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2011-02-04}}</ref><ref name="makingtime3">{{cite web|title=Immediate Mod Box Set|publisher=Making Time – Guide to British Music of the 1960s|url=http://www.makingtime.co.uk/cdrev32005.html|access-date=2011-02-04}}</ref> The album also featured their stage favourite "[[Baby Don't You Do It]]", featuring Jimmy Winston on lead vocals and guitar.<ref name="makingtime3"/>

The band's following single "[[Itchycoo Park]]", released on 11 August 1967, was the first of the band's two charting singles in the United States, reaching No. 16 in January 1968. The single was a bigger hit in Britain, peaking at No. 3.<ref name="bib"/> "Itchycoo Park" was the first British single to use [[flanging]], the technique of playing two identical master tapes simultaneously but altering the speed of one of them very slightly by touching the "flange" of one tape reel, which yielded a distinctive comb-filtering effect.<ref>{{cite book|author1=B.

It stayed at No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart for six weeks, but reached only No. 159 in the US.<ref name="allmusic7"/><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sexton |first=Paul|title=UK Rock Acts Fete Small Faces on Nice charity Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgcEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22UK+Rock+Acts+Fete+Small+Faces+on+Nice+charity+Set%22&pg=PA13|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=108 |date=September 1996 |page=13}}</ref>

The two-act concept album consisted of six original songs on side one and a whimsical [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] [[fairy tale]] on side two relating the adventures of "Happiness Stan" and his need to find out where the other half of the moon went when it waned. It was narrated by [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|Stanley Unwin]], after original plans to have [[Spike Milligan]] narrate the album went awry when he turned them down.<ref name="allmusic7"/><ref name="ianmclagan5">{{cite web|title=Small Faces Talk to You: The Story of the Small Faces in their own Words – Ogden's Nut Gone Flake|publisher=Ian McLagan Official Site|url=http://www.ianmclagan.com/sf/ogdens.htm|access-date=2011-02-09|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206173338/http://www.ianmclagan.com/sf/ogdens.htm|archive-date=6 February 2011}}</ref>

Critics were enthusiastic, and the album sold well, but the band were confronted by the practical problem that they had created a studio masterpiece, which was virtually impossible to recreate on the road. ''Ogdens''' was performed as a whole just once, and memorably, live in the studio on the BBC television programme ''[[Colour Me Pop]]''.<ref name="ianmclagan5"/>

====Breakup and ''The Autumn Stone'' (1969)====
{{Main|The Autumn Stone}}
Marriott officially quit the band at the end of 1968, walking off stage during a live New Year's Eve gig yelling "I quit".<ref name="rough"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Muise|page=95|year=2002|title=Gallagher, Marriott, Derringer & Trower: their lives and music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JI4LHXgz7YEC&q=New+Year%27s+Eve++Steve+Marriott&pg=PA95|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9780634029561}}</ref> Citing frustration at their failure to break out of their pop image and their inability to reproduce the more sophisticated material properly on stage, Marriott was already looking ahead to a new band, [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]], with [[Peter Frampton]].<ref name="rough"/> On the subject of the group's breakup, [[Kenney Jones]], in an interview with John Hellier (2001), said:

{{blockquote|I wish we had been a little bit more grown up at the time. If we had have [''sic''] played Ogdens' live it would have boosted our confidence so much. We were labelled as a pop band, which definitely got up Steve's nose more than we realised. I wish we had been more like The Who in the fact that when they have problems they stick together until they've overcome them. Steve just thought well how do we top Ogdens' and he was off. Ogdens' was a masterpiece if we had played it live we would have gone to even greater things. I reckon we were on the verge of crossing the great divide and becoming a heavier band.<ref name="wapping">{{cite web|title=An interview with Kenney Jones|publisher=Wapping Wharf.com|url=http://www.wappingwharf.com/kenney.htm|access-date=2011-02-09}}</ref>}}

After fulfilling outstanding live performance commitments, including a European tour in January, Small Faces' dissolution was formally announced in March 1969, and Marriott and Frampton's plans to form a new group together were unveiled (although the band were already formed and had been rehearsing together since January).<ref>Hewitt, Paulo and Hellier, John. ''[[Steve Marriott – All Too Beautiful...]]'' Helter Skelter (2005). {{ISBN|1-900924-44-7}}</ref> 

A posthumous album, ''[[The Autumn Stone (album)|The Autumn Stone]]'', was released later in 1969, and included the major Immediate recordings, a rare live concert performance, and a number of previously unreleased tracks recorded for their intended fourth LP, ''1862'', including the classic Swinging Sixties instrumental "Wide Eyed Girl on the Wall" and "Donkey Rides, A Penny, A Glass", co-written by Ian McLagan.<ref name="allmusic8">{{cite web|title=The Autumn Stone|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r711499/review|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2011-02-17}}</ref> The final single, "[[Afterglow (Of Your Love)]]", was released in 1969 after the band had ceased to exist and the single only reached No. 36 in the UK Singles Charts.<ref name="bib"/>

===Hiatus: 1969–75===

==== Faces (1969–75) ====
{{Main|Faces (band)}}
After Small Faces split, Lane, Jones and McLagan joined forces with two former members of [[the Jeff Beck Group]], singer [[Rod Stewart]] and guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]],<ref name="allmusic2"/> along with [[Art Wood]] and [[Kim Gardner]], to form Quiet Melon. Four singles were recorded before the lineup minus Art Wood and Gardner, became the [[Faces (band)|Faces]].<ref name="allmusic2"/><ref name="mclagan2000p153">{{cite book|title=All the Rage|last=McLagan|first=Ian|publisher=Pan Books|year=2000|isbn=0-330-37673-X|page=153|edition=revised}}</ref> However, hoping to capitalize on Small Faces' earlier success, record company executives wanted the band to keep their old name. The band objected, arguing the personnel changes resulted in a group altogether different from Small Faces.

As a compromise, the new line-up's first album in the UK was credited as ''First Step'' by the Faces, while in the US the same album was released as ''First Step'' by Small Faces.<ref name="flnotes">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Definitive Rock Collection|others=[[Faces (band)|Faces]]|year=2007|publisher=[[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]]}}</ref> The album was only a mild commercial success, and the record companies perceived no further need to market this new line-up as the "Small Faces". Accordingly, all subsequent albums by this incarnation of the band appeared under the new name, "Faces", on both sides of the Atlantic. However, all North American LP, cassette and CD reissues of ''First Step'' still credit the band as Small Faces.<ref>Liner notes in the Faces' ''The Definitive Rock Collection'', [[Rhino Records]], 2007.</ref>

Jones and McLagan stayed with the Faces until their breakup in 1975.<ref name="allmusic2"/> Lane exited the Faces slightly earlier, in 1973.<ref name="allmusic2"/> With his backing band, Slim Chance, Lane then released several singles and albums from 1973 to 1976, including the 1974 UK hit "[[How Come (Ronnie Lane song)|How Come]]".<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|last=Roberts|first=David|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|year=2005|isbn=1-904994-00-8|pages=57|title-link=British Hit Singles & Albums}}</ref>

==== Humble Pie (1969–75) ====
{{Main|Humble Pie}}
Marriott's first post-Small Faces venture was with the rock group [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]], formed with the former [[The Herd (UK band)|Herd]] member [[Peter Frampton]].<ref name="allmusic9">{{cite web|title=Steve Marriott|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p19169/biography|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=2011-02-18}}</ref> Initially, the group was a huge hit in the US and the UK,<ref name="allmusic9"/> but Humble Pie split in 1975 due to lack of later chart success.

===Reunion: 1975–78===
Following the breakup of the Faces in 1975, the original Small Faces line-up reformed briefly to film videos miming to the reissued "Itchycoo Park" which hit the charts again.<ref name="ianmclagan">{{cite web|url=http://www.ianmclagan.com/sf/reunions.htm|title=Small Faces Talk to You: The Story of the Small Faces in their own Words – Reunions|publisher=Ian McLagan Official Site|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041019235857/http://www.ianmclagan.com/sf/reunions.htm|archive-date=19 October 2004|access-date=2011-01-29}}</ref><ref name="billboard1">{{cite magazine|title=Small Faces Feted With Debut Album Reissue|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73052/small-faces-feted-with-debut-album-reissue|access-date=2011-03-03}}</ref> The group tried recording together again but Lane left after the first rehearsal due to an argument.<ref name="ianmclagan"/> Unknown to the others, he was just beginning to show the symptoms of [[multiple sclerosis]], and his behaviour was misinterpreted by Marriott and the others as a drunken tantrum.<ref name="ianmclagan"/>

Nevertheless, McLagan, Jones and Marriott decided to stay together as Small Faces, recruiting ex-[[Roxy Music]] bassist [[Rick Wills]] to take Lane's place.<ref name="ianmclagan"/> This iteration of Small Faces recorded two albums, ''[[Playmates album|Playmates]]'' (1977) and ''[[78 in the shade|78 in the Shade]]'' (1978), released on [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="ianmclagan"/> Guitarist [[Jimmy McCulloch]] also briefly joined this line-up after leaving [[Wings (band)|Wings]].<ref name="rollingstone"/> When McCulloch phoned [[Paul McCartney]], who had found him increasingly difficult to work with, to announce he was joining Marriott, McCartney reportedly said "I was a little put out at first, but, well, what can you say to that?"<ref>{{cite book|author=Carlin|page=[https://archive.org/details/paulmccartneylif00carl/page/248 248]|year=2009|title=Paul McCartney: A Life|url=https://archive.org/details/paulmccartneylif00carl|url-access=registration|quote=McCartney Jimmy McCulloch faces.|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]}}</ref> McCulloch's tenure with the band lasted only for a few months in late 1977.

== Influence ==
Small Faces were an early influence on seminal British [[Punk rock|punk]] band the [[Sex Pistols]], who regularly covered them in live shows.{{Sfn|Gracyk|2001|p=7}} [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]] changed lyrics like "I want you to know that I love you baby, want you to know that I care" in "Whatcha Gonna Do About It" to "I want you to know that I ''hate'' you baby, want you to know I ''don't'' care".{{Sfn|Smith|2018|pp=22–23}}

Small Faces and other 1960s mod bands resurged in interest with the [[mod revival]] of the late-1970s, led by [[the Jam]].{{Sfn|Hawkins|2017|pp=19–20}} [[Paul Weller]] of the Jam said: "The Small Faces are a massive influence on me. It's everything for me: they looked great, their music was great, their attitude was great. It was the most complete band for me."<ref>{{Cite web |title=The VH1 Interview |url=http://www.wellerworld.co.uk/vh1int.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240706032617/http://www.wellerworld.co.uk/vh1int.htm |archive-date=6 July 2024 |access-date=30 December 2024 |website=wellerworld.co.uk}}</ref>

Small Faces were one of the 1960s British pop groups that highly influenced the [[Britpop]] movement of the 1990s; Professors Andy Bennett and [[Jon Stratton]] place them among [[the Beatles]] and [[the Kinks]] in this regard.{{Sfn|Bennett|Stratton|2016|p=1}}
