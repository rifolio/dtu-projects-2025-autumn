'''Jefferson Starship''' is an American rock band from [[San Francisco]] formed in 1974 by a group of musicians including former members of [[Jefferson Airplane]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kurtz |first=Warren |date=April 8, 2024 |title=Jefferson Starship members on band's 50th anniversary and celebrated music |url=https://www.goldminemag.com/columns/jefferson-starship-members-on-bands-50th-anniversary-and-celebrated-music |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240423132006/https://www.goldminemag.com/columns/jefferson-starship-members-on-bands-50th-anniversary-and-celebrated-music |archive-date=April 23, 2024 |access-date=April 23, 2024 |website=Goldmine Magazine: Record Collector & Music Memorabilia |language=en}}</ref> Between 1974 and 1984, they released eight [[RIAA certification|gold]] or [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]-selling studio albums, and one gold-selling compilation.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=jefferson+starship&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section|title=Jefferson Airplane/Starship Gold and Platinum Selling Certifications |website=Recording Industry Association of America|access-date=June 24, 2019|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229230700/https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=jefferson+starship&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH |archive-date=December 29, 2019 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The album ''[[Red Octopus]]'' went double-platinum and was No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in 1975.<ref name="Billboard_200">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/jefferson-starship/chart-history/tlp/|title=Jefferson Starship Billboard 200 Chart History|magazine=Billboard|access-date=October 31, 2021|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201118051328/https://www.billboard.com/music/jefferson-starship/chart-history/TLP|archive-date=November 18, 2020|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The band went through several major changes in personnel and genres through the years while retaining the Jefferson Starship name. The band name was retired in 1984, but it was picked up again in 1992 by a revival of the group led by [[Paul Kantner]], which continued after his death in 2016.

The group was formed by former Jefferson Airplane members Kantner and [[Grace Slick]], and evolved from several solo albums they had recorded. They were joined by [[David Freiberg]], [[Craig Chaquico]], [[John Barbata]], [[Pete Sears]], and [[Papa John Creach]]. Former Airplane frontman [[Marty Balin]] subsequently joined the group in 1975, and the following year's album ''[[Spitfire (Jefferson Starship album)|Spitfire]]'' was a top five hit.<ref name="Billboard_200"/> Slick and Balin both left the group in 1978, leaving the remaining members to recruit [[Mickey Thomas (singer)|Mickey Thomas]] as their replacement. In 1981 Slick rejoined the group, which continued with minor chart success. Kantner quit in 1984 and took legal action towards using the name; the remaining members became [[Starship (band)|Starship]]. Kantner reformed the group as Jefferson Starship: The Next Generation in 1992, which toured regularly throughout that decade and into the 21st century. After Kantner's death, the group continued with new members. Craig Chaquico filed a lawsuit against them in 2016 for continuing to use the name, and the suit was subsequently settled.

==History==
===1970–1974: Origins===
In 1970, while [[Jefferson Airplane]] was on break from touring, singer-guitarist [[Paul Kantner]] recorded ''[[Blows Against the Empire]]''. It is a concept album featuring an ad hoc group of musicians (centered on Kantner, [[Grace Slick]], [[Joey Covington]], and [[Jack Casady]] of Jefferson Airplane; [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]]; and [[Grateful Dead]] members [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Mickey Hart]], and [[Bill Kreutzmann]]) credited on the LP as Paul Kantner and "Jefferson Starship", marking the first use of that name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/music/album/paul-kantner-jefferson-starship/blows-against-the-empire/8d6kgx512wh2|title=Blows Against the Empire|website=Microsoft.com|access-date=July 5, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023164225/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/music/album/paul-kantner-jefferson-starship/blows-against-the-empire/8d6kgx512wh2|archive-date=October 23, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="BATE-AllMusic">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/blows-against-the-empire-mw0000024441|title=Blows Against the Empire |last=Ruhlmann |first=William |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=September 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509080517/https://www.allmusic.com/album/blows-against-the-empire-mw0000024441|archive-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This agglomeration was informally known as the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra, a moniker later used on a Kantner album in the early 1980s.<ref name="PERRO-AllMusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/planet-earth-rock-and-roll-orchestra-mw0000855723|title=Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220301031500/https://www.allmusic.com/album/planet-earth-rock-and-roll-orchestra-mw0000855723|archive-date=March 1, 2022|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On ''Blows Against the Empire'', Kantner and Slick sang about a group of people escaping Earth in a hijacked starship. In 1971, the album was nominated for the prestigious science fiction prize, the [[Hugo Award]], a rare honor for a musical recording.  Kantner and Slick were a couple during this period. Slick was pregnant during the recording of the album.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=231|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> Their daughter, [[China Kantner|China]], was born shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nu8gAAAAIBAJ&pg=5269,3520946&dq=paul+kantner&hl=en|title=Daughter Born To Pop Singer|date=January 26, 1971|publisher=The Day|access-date=December 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222164448/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nu8gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vnMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5269,3520946&dq=paul+kantner&hl=en|archive-date=December 22, 2015|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Kantner and Slick with the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra released two follow-up albums: ''[[Sunfighter]]'', an environmentalism-tinged album released in 1971 to celebrate China's birth, and 1973's ''[[Baron von Tollbooth & the Chrome Nun]]'', titled after the nicknames [[David Crosby]] had given to the couple. Bassist/keyboardist/vocalist [[David Freiberg]] was given equal billing alongside Kantner and Slick on the latter album. A founding member of [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], Freiberg had known and played with Kantner on the folk circuit in the early 1960s and sang background vocals on ''Blows Against the Empire''. Following a marijuana arrest that resulted in his departure from Quicksilver in 1971, he joined Jefferson Airplane as a vocalist for their 1972 tour, documented on the live album ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Winterland]]'' (1973).<ref name=Freiberg-AM>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-freiberg-mn0000638153/biography |title=David Freiberg |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |website=[[Allmusic]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011021453/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-freiberg-mn0000638153/biography |archive-date=October 11, 2017 |url-status=live |language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="TSOW-AllMusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/thirty-seconds-over-winterland-mw0000204694|title=Thirty Seconds Over Winterland|last=Planer|first=Lindsay|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621195522/http://www.allmusic.com/album/thirty-seconds-over-winterland-mw0000204694|archive-date=June 21, 2012|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Kantner was introduced to the teenage guitarist [[Craig Chaquico]] through his friend and fellow musician, Jack Traylor, during this time. Chaquico, a high school English student of Traylor's and a member in his band Steelwind, played guitar on the song "Earth Mother" from ''Sunfighter''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=251|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> Chaquico would go on to perform with Kantner and Slick on their subsequent album collaborations, then with Jefferson Starship, and finally with Starship until 1990.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jefferson-starship-mn0000840050/biography |title=Jefferson Starship: Artist Biography |last=Ruhlmann |first=William |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=August 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625213447/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jefferson-starship-mn0000840050/biography|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="AllMusicStarshipBio">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/starship-mn0000748168/biography|title=AllMusic Starship Biography |last=Ruhlmann|first=William |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620102219/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/starship-mn0000748168/biography|archive-date=June 20, 2018|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Early in 1974, Slick released ''[[Manhole (album)|Manhole]]'', her first solo album.<ref name="Manhole-AllMusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/manhole-mw0000015080|title=Manhole|last=Viglione|first=Joe|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619200955/http://www.allmusic.com/album/manhole-mw0000015080|archive-date=June 19, 2012|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Appearing along with Slick on ''Manhole'' were Kantner, Freiberg, Chaquico, Jack Casady, David Crosby, and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].<ref name="Manhole-AllMusic"/> It was on that album that Kantner, Slick, and Freiberg next worked with bassist and keyboard player [[Pete Sears]] (who had first played on [[Papa John Creach]]'s first solo album). Sears, was co-producing a [[Kathi McDonald]] album in the same studio. Sears wrote the music to Slick's lyrics for the song "Better Lying Down," and also played bass on the song "Epic #38". It was during this session at Wally Heider studios in San Francisco that Kantner and Slick first approached Sears about playing in what would eventually become Jefferson Starship.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=270|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> Sears would eventually join Jefferson Starship in June 1974, replacing [[Peter Kaukonen]].<ref name="allmusic"/>

In early 1974, with guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and bass player Jack Casady having moved on to their band [[Hot Tuna]] full-time, Kantner decided to put together a touring band without them. The musicians on ''Baron von Tollbooth & the Chrome Nun'' formed the core of a new lineup that was formally reborn as Jefferson Starship. They appropriated the name from Kantner's ''Blows Against the Empire'', with manager [[Bill Thompson (manager)|Bill Thompson]] convincing the group that keeping the connection to Jefferson Airplane made sense from a business standpoint.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=267|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> It included the other five remaining members of Jefferson Airplane, including Kantner on rhythm guitar and vocals; Slick on vocals and percussion, David Freiberg on vocals and keyboards, [[John Barbata]], who had played with [[the Turtles]] and Crosby, Stills and Nash, on drums and Papa John Creach, from Hot Tuna, on electric violin. Jorma Kaukonen's brother, Peter (who had appeared on the albums ''Blows Against the Empire'' and ''Sunfighter''), was on bass. On lead guitar was Craig Chaquico who had played on three of Kantner and Slick's solo albums, as well as in the band Steelwind. The band began rehearsals in January 1974 and opened its first tour in Chicago on March 19. By April, it was decided that the band would go into the studio to record an album. British veteran Pete Sears, who had worked on Slick's solo album, ''Manhole'', and played with Rod Stewart, was selected to replace Peter Kaukonen as the band's bass player.<ref name="allmusic"/>

In 1974, after touring as "Jefferson Starship," Kantner, Slick, Freiberg, Chaquico, Pete Sears, Papa John Creach, and John Barbata recorded the album ''[[Dragon Fly (album)|Dragon Fly]]''. Jorma Kaukonen's brother Peter had played bass during the group's spring tour in 1974, but was replaced by [[Pete Sears]] who, like Freiberg, played bass and keyboards. Kantner collaborated with [[Marty Balin]] on the song "Caroline" during the recording sessions, for which Balin sang vocals on the album.<ref name="allmusic"/> ''Dragon Fly'' was certified gold, and included the single "Ride the Tiger" (No. 84 [[Billboard Hot 100|US Billboard]]) and its [[B-side]] "Hyperdrive".<ref name="RIAA"/><ref name="Billboard-H100">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/jefferson-starship/chart-history/hsi/|title=Jefferson Starship Chart History|magazine=Billboard|access-date=June 24, 2019|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229230847/https://www.billboard.com/music/jefferson-starship/chart-history/hot-100|archive-date=December 29, 2019|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Balin then appeared on-stage with the band to perform the song "Caroline" for a show at the Winterland ballroom in November 1974.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="BestClassicBands">{{cite web |url=https://bestclassicbands.com/marty-balin-joins-jefferson-starship-onstage-11-21-15/ |title=Nov 21, 1974: Marty Balin Joins Jefferson Starship Onstage |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|publisher=Best Classic Bands |date=November 21, 2015|access-date=August 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820074615/https://bestclassicbands.com/marty-balin-joins-jefferson-starship-onstage-11-21-15/|archive-date=August 20, 2018|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Their followup album, 1975's ''[[Red Octopus]]'', had even greater success. Marty Balin, who had contributed and sung the ballad "Caroline" on the previous album, officially returned to the Jefferson fold as a full-time member in January 1975 and stayed with the group for nearly the remainder of the decade.<ref name="BestClassicBands"/> The Balin penned single "[[Miracles (Jefferson Starship song)|Miracles]]” peaked at No. 3 on the chart, and along with the single “Play on Love” (No. 49 US Billboard Chart), helped to propel the album to eventual multiple-platinum status and topping the [[Billboard 200]] chart.<ref name="RIAA"/><ref name="Billboard-H100"/><ref name="Billboard_200"/> It would be the biggest selling album of the band's career.

The next album, ''[[Spitfire (Jefferson Starship album)|Spitfire]]'', was released in June 1976 and went platinum.<ref name="allmusic"/> It spent six weeks at No. 3 on the Billboard charts, and included the singles "With Your Love" (No. 12 US Billboard Chart) and "St. Charles" (No. 64 US Billboard Chart).<ref name="RIAA"/><ref name="Billboard-H100"/><ref name="Billboard_200"/> Regardless of this success, the band considered the album's sales to be relatively disappointing compared to its predecessor and requested an audit from [[RCA Records]], distributor of their Grunt label.<ref name="Rolling-Stone-Jefferson-Starship-1978">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jefferson-starship-strange-times-at-the-launching-pad-53857/ |title=Jefferson Starship: Strange Times on the Launching Pad|date=May 18, 1978|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|volume=58|access-date=August 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827110405/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jefferson-starship-strange-times-at-the-launching-pad-53857/|archive-date=August 27, 2018|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all }}</ref> RCA subsequently put a reported $500,000 into the next Jefferson Starship project. ''[[Earth (Jefferson Starship album)|Earth]]'' was released in February 1978 and also went platinum.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album featured the singles "Count on Me" (No. 8 US Billboard Chart), "Runaway" (No. 12 US Billboard Chart), and "Crazy Feelin'" (No. 54 US Billboard Chart).<ref name="Billboard-H100"/> Tours of the U.S. and Europe would soon follow.

Balin's reluctance to tour had kept the band off the road for over a year, and Slick's alcoholism increasingly became a problem, which led to two consecutive nights of disastrous concerts in West Germany in June 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://popshifter.com/2008-03-30/wasted-the-top-five-most-inebriated-performances-tours-in-no-particular-order/|title=Wasted!

===1979–1984: Changing personnel and sound===

In early 1979, the band regrouped.

[[File:Jefferson Starship 22.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Pete Sears and Craig Chaquico of Jefferson Starship in Central Park in 1981]]
In 1979, the band released their first album without Marty Balin or Grace Slick, the gold-selling ''[[Freedom at Point Zero]]''.<ref name="RIAA"/> The album was produced by [[Ron Nevison]], who would also produce two of the band's following three albums. The single "[[Jane (Jefferson Starship song)|Jane]]" (Freiberg, McPherson, Chaquico and Kantner) peaked at No. 14 on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'' and spent three weeks at No. 6 on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' Top 100.<sup>[[Freedom at Point Zero#cite note-3|[3]]]</sup><ref name="Billboard-H100"/> The new lineup toured, augmented by saxophonist Steve Schuster. Schuster, along with horn player David Farey, had previously played on Jefferson Starship's 1978 tour, and he had also appeared on ''Freedom at Point Zero''.

In early 1981, Grace Slick returned to the band, rejoining in time to sing on one song, "Stranger," (No. 48 on the ''Billboard Hot 100'' chart), on the group's next album, ''[[Modern Times (Jefferson Starship album)|Modern Times]]'' (1981).<ref name="Billboard-H100"/> ''Modern Times'', which also went gold, included the song "Find Your Way Back" (No. 29), as well as the humorous "Stairway to Cleveland", in which the band defended the numerous changes it had undergone in its musical style, personnel, and even name.<ref name="RIAA"/><ref name="Billboard-H100"/> ''Modern Times'' also featured the promo single, "Save Your Love", (No. 104).

Paul Kantner's 1983 solo album, ''[[Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra (album)|Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra]]'', included the track "Circle of Fire", which had been recorded by Jefferson Starship during the ''Winds of Change'' sessions in 1982.

Around this time, the band began enthusiastically embracing the rock-video age, making elaborate videos typical of the era's superstar bands. They would appear frequently on [[Music Television|MTV]] and other music-oriented television shows such as ''Solid Gold'', and 1984's ''Super Night of Rock and Roll'', giving the band a high visibility in the MTV era. Their next album, ''[[Nuclear Furniture]]'' (1984), reached No. 28 and was also certified gold.<ref name="RIAA"/><ref name="Billboard_200"/> It featured the singles "No Way Out" (a [[Top 40]] hit, reaching No. 23), "Layin' It On the Line" (No. 66), and "Sorry Me, Sorry You".<ref name="Billboard-H100"/>

===1984-1985: Kantner departs and transition to Starship===
While Balin and Slick had come and gone over the years, in June 1984, after the release of ''Nuclear Furniture'', Kantner, the last remaining founding member of Jefferson Airplane, left the band due to disputes over the group's artistic direction. "I think we would be terrible failures trying to write pop songs all the time. … The band became more mundane and not quite as challenging and not quite as much of a thing to be proud of," said Kantner.<ref name="UCR_Giles">{{Cite web|title=How Jefferson Airplane Became Jefferson Starship – And Then Just Starship|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/jefferson-airplane-jefferson-starship-starship/|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|first=Jeff|last=Giles|date=August 15, 2014|access-date=December 25, 2015|publisher=[[Loudwire]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929212932/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/jefferson-airplane-jefferson-starship-starship/|archive-date=September 29, 2017|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In October 1984, Kantner took legal action over money he claimed he was owed and to prevent the remaining members from continuing to use the name Jefferson Starship. The lawsuit was settled in March 1985. Kantner received a cash settlement, the name Jefferson Starship became the property of Grace Slick (51%) and Bill Thompson (49%), and all parties agreed to not use the name "Jefferson" going forward.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=330|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> The remaining members renamed themselves [[Starship (band)|Starship]], and continued to tour and record music. David Freiberg was dismissed from the band shortly after the lawsuit was settled. Pete Sears departed in 1987. Grace Slick left Starship in early 1988, going on to join the reformed Jefferson Airplane for an album and tour in 1989. Craig Chaquico departed in 1990. The band has been billed as "Starship featuring Mickey Thomas" since 1992.<ref name="UCR_Giles"/><ref name="AllMusicStarshipBio"/>

Shortly after leaving Jefferson Starship, Kantner formed the [[KBC Band]] with (among others) his former bandmates Marty Balin and Jack Casady. They released an [[KBC Band (album)|eponymous album]] in 1986, but soon broke up after Balin lost interest. In 1988, Kantner toured with Casady in [[Hot Tuna]]. This led to a full Jefferson Airplane reunion in 1989, which also resulted in an [[Jefferson Airplane (album)|eponymous album]] and subsequent tour. In 1991, Kantner toured with an acoustic ensemble called "Paul Kantner's Wooden Ships," a trio that included [[Slick Aguilar]] and [[Tim Gorman]] from the KBC Band.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-10-28-ca-352-story.html |title=Pop Music Reviews: Kantner's Idealism Still Flies |last=Hochman|first=Steve|date=October 28, 1991 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 15, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230115071215/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-10-28-ca-352-story.html|archive-date=January 15, 2023|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

After the first couple of years, the band dropped the use of "The Next Generation", and began to perform as simply Jefferson Starship. In 1995 they released ''[[Deep Space / Virgin Sky]]'', a live album recorded at the House of Blues in West Hollywood, California on January 21, 1995. The album featured eight new and seven classic tunes. Grace Slick joined the band for five songs, "Lawman", "Wooden Ships", "[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]" and "[[White Rabbit (Jefferson Airplane song)|White Rabbit]]" and "[[Volunteers (song)|Volunteers]]". In 1999 Jefferson Starship released the studio album ''[[Windows of Heaven (album)|Windows of Heaven]]'', which featured Slick on background vocals on one song, "I'm On Fire".<ref name=WOH-AllMusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/windows-of-heaven-mw0000047535 |title=Windows of Heaven - Jefferson Starship|first=Michael B.|last=Smith|website=allmusic.com |access-date=July 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627023354/http://www.allmusic.com/album/windows-of-heaven-mw0000047535 |archive-date=June 27, 2014 |url-status=live |language=en-US |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2007, Jefferson Starship began working with corporate sponsors. The owners of the name Jefferson Starship, Grace Slick along with manager Bill Thompson, objected. They sued Kantner for the sponsorship and for touring under the Jefferson Starship name, citing their initial separation agreement in 1985.
