==History==
===Formative years (1991–1993)===
[[Image:Raine Maida 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Raine Maida co-founded the band with Mike Turner in 1992.]]
In late 1991, guitarist [[Mike Turner (musician)|Mike Turner]] placed an ad in Toronto-based ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now newspaper]]'' in search of musicians. [[Raine Maida|Michael Maida]], a [[criminology]] student at the [[University of Toronto]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/artists/our-lady-peace#biography|title=Biography|publisher=NME|access-date=September 17, 2009}}</ref> was the first to reply. The two formed a band called As If, inviting Jim Newell as drummer and Paul Martin to play bass. After they played a number of shows in [[Oshawa]] with a mix of original and cover material, Martin departed, and the band placed an ad for a replacement bassist. Chris Eacrett replied and was accepted after auditioning. During that time, Turner and Maida met songwriter and producer [[Arnold Lanni]], the owner of Arnyard Studios. The band, with Lanni, commenced writing and recording some material under the As If name.

Soon after, the band changed their name to Our Lady Peace, after a [[Mark Van Doren]] poem of the same name. Lanni encouraged them to perform some shows in Eastern Ontario and [[Montreal]] with [[The Tea Party (band)|The Tea Party]]. During this time, Maida began using the stage name "Raine".{{cn|date=May 2024}}

[[File:Jer-Dec-2002.jpg|left|thumb|125px|Jeremy Taggart joined the band as drummer in April 1993.<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706215620/http://www.ourladypeace.cc/bandology.htm Our Lady Peace bandology]}} – ''Ourladypeace.cc''. Retrieved March 29, 2010.</ref>]]
An independent music video of the band's debut song, "Out of Here", was created in February 1992 by Sam Siciliano, who produced, edited, and directed the video. The video was aired on the [[MuchMusic]] ''Indie'' show. After returning to Arnyard Studios to continue writing and recording, Newell departed the band. Writing and recording continued with session drummer John Bouvette.

With managers Rob Lanni and Eric Lawrence of Coalition Entertainment representing the band, short showcases were arranged with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music Canada]], [[EMI|EMI Canada]], and [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Canada]]. Sony Music Canada head of [[Artist and repertoire|A&R]] Richard Zuckerman saw the potential of the band, its producer, and management. The band signed a record and publishing deal with Sony Music Canada in April 1993, and began writing for their debut album. Around the same time, [[Jeremy Taggart]] joined the band as permanent drummer.

===Early success (1994–2000)===
After writing and recording over the next year or so, OLP released its debut album, ''[[Naveed (album)|Naveed]]'', in Canada in March 1994, through Sony Music Canada.<ref name="Inc.1996">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=Sony Music Takes on the World|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62|date=June 22, 1996|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=62–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The first single from the album, "[[The Birdman (song)|The Birdman]], was released in January 1994 but did not obtain enough airplay to chart on the Canadian RPM Top 100 Singles Chart. Maida would later say "The Birdman" was chosen as the lead single because its non-commercial sound would likely appeal to university campus radio on which OLP hoped to develop "a buzz", and that waiting a few months to release a more commercial song gave them time to tour with other bands in order to improve their live show.<ref name=LeBlanc>LeBlanc, Larry.

''Naveed'' picked up and released in the United States in March 1995 by a Sony Music indie label, [[Relativity Records]], after which the band toured as the opening act for [[Van Halen]]'s Balance summer tour as well as opening shows for Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. "[[Starseed (song)|Starseed]]" was a significant hit in United States reaching Nos. 7 and 11 on the Billboard Modern and Mainstream Rock Charts, respectively.<ref name="US-2">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/our-lady-peace-p169679/charts-awards/billboard-singles|title=Our Lady Peace > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision|access-date=August 13, 2010}}</ref> Touring behind the album resumed in 1996 with time spent opening for [[Alanis Morissette]]. A remix of "Starseed" would later be added to the ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' film soundtrack.  In early 1997, Our Lady Peace was offered (and the band accepted) an American signing with [[Columbia Records]], expanding their horizons within Sony Music. After touring for the album ''Naveed'' concluded, the band began work on their second studio album. As the writing process ensued, bassist Chris Eacrett left the band due to musical differences. [[Duncan Coutts]], a [[Ridley College (Ontario)|Ridley College]] alumnus and former classmate of Raine Maida, joined the band during the recording of that second album. Coincidentally, Duncan Coutts and Mike Turner both studied at the [[University of Western Ontario]] and lived in [[Saugeen–Maitland Hall]].

Our Lady Peace's second album, ''[[Clumsy (Our Lady Peace album)|Clumsy]]'', was released in January 1997. The album cover is based on an abandoned song called "Trapeze", which was initially intended to be the title of the album. The albums's lead single, the guitar-driven "[[Superman's Dead]]", quickly rose to No. 2 for five weeks on Canada's Alternative Rock Songs chart pushing the album to debut at No. 1 on the Canadian Album Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com:80/damn/1999/19990929.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030725060252/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/1999/19990929.html|url-status=usurped|archive-date=July 25, 2003|title=TWO IN A ROW: OUR LADY PEACE DEBUT AT #1 IN CANADA!|publisher=[[Chart Attack]]|access-date=January 21, 2019}}</ref> The second single, "[[Clumsy (Our Lady Peace song)|Clumsy]]", was just as successful, topping the Canadian RPM Singles chart<ref name="auto"/> while also reaching No. 2 on the Alternative Rock Chart. Subsequent singles "[[Automatic Flowers]]" and "[[4 AM (Our Lady Peace song)|4 AM]]", the band's first ballad released as a single, also made the Top 10 on the Alternative Rock chart establishing Our Lady Peace as a leading band in the Canadian rock scene. The most-listened to alternative rock station in Canada, Toronto's CFNY, listed ''Clumsy'' as the No. 1 album for 1997, based on sales, listener requests for songs, and listener votes for the year's top album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spiritofradio.ca/Charts.asp#1997|title=CFNY Hit Lists|website=Spiritofradio.ca|access-date=July 20, 2021}}</ref> In February 2001, Clumsy was certified Diamond (1 million copies) in sales in Canada. Between 1996 and 2017, ''Clumsy'' was the best-selling album by a Canadian band in Canada and the eight best-selling album by a Canadian artist overall in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://musiccanada.wordpress.com/2017/06/30/top-150-canadian-albums/|title=Top 150 Canadian Albums|website=musiccanada.wordpress.com|date=July 2017 |access-date=January 1, 2020}}</ref>  In the US, both "Superman's Dead" and "Clumsy" made the Top 15 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, while peaking at No. 11 and No. 5, respectively, on the Alternative Rock Tracks Chart.  ''Clumsy'' reached the Top 80 on the Billboard Album Chart and was certified Platinum for sales of 1 million units in the US.

In 1999, Our Lady Peace released their third album, titled ''[[Happiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch]]''. The album included such hits as "[[Thief (Our Lady Peace song)|Thief]]", a song about a young girl the band met named Mina Kim, who had cancer, as well as "[[One Man Army (song)|One Man Army]]" and "[[Is Anybody Home?]]". Legendary jazz drummer [[Elvin Jones]] was featured on the song "Stealing Babies". Multi-instrumentalist Jamie Edwards was brought in for the 1996 sessions for the album (he remained an unofficial member of the band until 2001, when he was asked to officially join the band to finish the ''[[Gravity (Our Lady Peace album)|Gravity]]'' album). Later that year, the band played an eleven-song set at [[Woodstock 1999]].

[[File:Mike-Sept.10-2001.jpg|right|125px|thumb|The exact circumstances surrounding former lead guitarist Mike Turner's 2001 departure are disputed.]]
In 2000, the band recorded and released ''[[Spiritual Machines]]'', a [[concept album]] inspired by [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s book ''[[The Age of Spiritual Machines]]''. During the recording of the album, drummer Jeremy Taggart was sidelined with an ankle injury; [[Soundgarden]] and [[Pearl Jam]] drummer [[Matt Cameron]], played drums on "Right Behind You (Mafia)" and "Are You Sad?" in his place. The album featured the singles "[[In Repair (Our Lady Peace song)|In Repair]]", "Life" and "Right Behind You (Mafia)". "Life" was also featured in the soundtrack for the Canadian sports comedy film ''[[Men with Brooms]]''. ''Spiritual Machines'' was less commercially successful than its predecessors.

===Line-up and stylistic changes (2001–2005)===
By the early 2000s, the band was becoming restless, feeling a "numbness" with their popularity as well as the "over-saturation" of their songs on Canadian radio.  The band almost broke up after completing their ''Spiritual Machines'' tour.<ref name="Durham">Durham, Victoria.

Its second single, "Innocent", was also very popular, peaking at No. 2 in Canada, and regained popularity in 2008 after a cover performance on ''[[American Idol]]''. Gravity proved to be more successful than Spiritual Machines in both America and Canada, due to the success of the singles; it reached No. 2 in Canada and No. 9 in the US, their highest charting album in the US. In between their fifth and sixth albums, OLP released their first live album, titled simply ''[[Live (Our Lady Peace album)|Live]]'', which contains a selection of the band's hits from their first five albums as played throughout tours in various Canadian cities.

In August 2005, the band released their sixth album, ''[[Healthy in Paranoid Times]]'', which included the singles "[[Angels/Losing/Sleep]]", "Will the Future Blame Us", and "Where Are You?" According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', it took 1165 days to create it, and its twelve tracks were chosen from forty-five that the band had written and produced.  Maida has since criticized ''Healthy in Paranoid Times'', saying that "(the) record was total excess, total bullshit in the sense of, we finally had succumbed to a label: making us record that many songs, trying to find the right singles for American radio and MTV."<ref name="preferMC">{{cite web|access-date=July 17, 2008|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=529733b0-3e18-45b7-81ed-6b61bb12a36c|work=Montreal Gazette|title=interview with Raine Maida|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611090329/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/arts/story.html?id=529733b0-3e18-45b7-81ed-6b61bb12a36c|archive-date=June 11, 2008}}</ref> After nearly breaking up during the recording of ''Healthy in Paranoid Times''<ref name="sales" /> the band took a prolonged hiatus.

===Compilations, hiatus, and ''Burn Burn'' (2006–2009)===
In November 2006, Columbia Records released a greatest hits compilation titled ''[[A Decade]],'' following the band's departure from the label. There were two previously unreleased songs on the album, "Kiss on the Mouth" and "Better Than Here". Steve Mazur wrote in a blog on the band's fan club that the new songs on the disc were two unreleased songs from the ''[[Healthy in Paranoid Times]]'' sessions. The collection also included a bonus DVD containing live concert footage and exclusive interviews at the [[Massey Hall]] concert. The single "Kiss on the Mouth", the first off ''A Decade'', has received play on radio stations across Canada.  Lead vocalist Raine Maida began work on his first [[solo album]], ''[[The Hunters Lullaby]]'', released in 2007, while the remaining members of the band pursued other personal endeavours. The hiatus would result in the longest time gap between OLP studio albums to date.

The band began working on ''[[Burn Burn (album)|Burn Burn]]'', their seventh studio album, in February 2007.  On March 31, 2009, [[Legacy Recordings]] released OLP's second compilation album, ''[[The Very Best of Our Lady Peace]]'' as part of the Playlist series. The album includes the popular singles "[[Naveed (song)|Naveed]]" and "[[Somewhere Out There (Our Lady Peace song)|Somewhere Out There]]", as well as lesser-known songs such as "Car Crash" and "Stealing Babies".  That same month, the band completed the new material, with Raine calling the new album "huge", and noted it as being a "proper rock album again", featuring a return to the raw originality of the band's first album ''[[Naveed (album)|Naveed]]'', though a "little more [[maturity (psychological)|mature]]".<ref name="OLP">{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Lowdown/2008/05/13/5551481-ca.html|title=interview with Raine Maida|publisher=Canoe|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110524163703/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Lowdown/2008/05/13/5551481-ca.html|archive-date=May 24, 2011|url-status=usurped|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref> Maida produced the album himself, noting his excitement over "not (having had) anybody intrude on (recording) sessions".<ref name="OLP" /> The album was released in North America on July 21, 2009, to mixed reviews, though the album later received Gold status in Canada.<ref name="Release">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090509164741/http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/2309071 Our Lady Peace set to release their seventh studio album July 21] – ''Tradingmarkets.com''.

In December 2009, the band announced a new tour.  In a tour that ran from March to May 2010, and spanned Canada and select U.S. cities, the band "recreated" both their 1997 album ''[[Clumsy (Our Lady Peace album)|Clumsy]]'' and their 2000 album ''[[Spiritual Machines]]'' in their entirety.<ref name="OLP2010">[http://ourladypeace.net/EWOLP/#D847 An Evening with Our Lady Peace] — ''Ourladypeace.net''.

In 2012, the band released a song titled "Fight the Good Fight" in reaction to the [[Occupy Wall Street]] events that took place across North America in late 2011 for ''[[Occupy This Album]]''.

===Taggart's departure and ''Somethingness'' (2014–2018)===
A planned tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ''Naveed'' was cancelled in early 2014 due to "scheduling conflicts". In June 2014, speculation began that longtime drummer Jeremy Taggart was no longer part of the band; this was confirmed in statements by both Taggart and Our Lady Peace on June 30, 2014. Canadian drummer Jason Pierce (ex-touring drummer for [[Paramore]] and current touring drummer for [[Treble Charger]]) filled in during live shows, and Jason Boesel of Rilo Kiley handled recording duties.<ref name="riffyou.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.riffyou.com/interview-raine-maida-talks-new-our-lady-peace-music-taggarts-exit/|title=Interview: Raine Maida Talks New Our Lady Peace Music, Taggart's Exit - Riffyou.com|work=Riffyou.com|date=July 21, 2014 |access-date=October 25, 2015}}</ref>

==Musical style and themes==

Our Lady Peace is mainly described as [[post-grunge]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/our-lady-peace/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214061610/http://www.mtv.com/artists/our-lady-peace/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 14, 2012|title=Our Lady Peace|work=MTV Artists|access-date=October 28, 2015}}</ref> and [[alternative rock]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/our-lady-peace-emc/|title=Our Lady Peace|author=Steve McLean|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=October 28, 2015}}</ref>

In the band's early years, especially on ''[[Naveed (album)|Naveed]]'' and ''[[Clumsy (Our Lady Peace album)|Clumsy]]'', their overall sound was often compared to alternative rock and grunge bands including [[Soundgarden]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], and [[Pearl Jam]].<ref name="NvdReview"/> The band's [[melody|melodic structure]] was also said to echo that of bands such as [[The Beatles]] and [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref name="NvdReview" /> Lead singer [[Raine Maida]] expresses much admiration for vocalist [[Mike Patton]] and his versatility, calling him "by far one of the best singers and best showmen in rock", while also naming the song "[[Everything's Ruined]]" by his band [[Faith No More]] among his favorites.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=March 12, 2021|url=https://ink19.com/2001/11/magazine/interviews/our-lady-peace|publication-date=November 5, 2001|title=The Soul in the Machine: An Interview with Raine Maida of Our Lady Peace|first=Gail |last=Worley|website=Ink19.com}}</ref> Maida's voice was called "erratic" and "truly unrivaled" in his field.<ref name="NvdReview" /> In albums ''Naveed'' through ''[[Spiritual Machines]]'', Maida sang in a [[countertenor]] vocal register and was known for his frequent use of [[falsetto]]. This singing method, in combination with the band's melody structure, often gave many songs a [[surrealism|surreal]] sound and effect.

The band's song "Whatever" was used as professional wrestler [[Chris Benoit]]'s [[WWE]] theme song from 2002 until his death in 2007. Our Lady Peace had not performed the song live for a number of years prior to the [[Chris Benoit murder-suicide|murder-suicide of Benoit and his family in 2007]]. In a 2012 interview, the band stated that they would never play the song live again due to the circumstances of Benoit's death.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chattman |first=Jon |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-chattman/asides-with-jon-chattman-_13_b_1418159.html |title=Our Lady Peace Throws a Curve, Discusses the Late Chris Benoit |date=April 12, 2012 |access-date=August 2, 2014 |publisher=[[Huffington Post]]}}</ref> In 2025, the band resumed playing the song as part of their 30th Anniversary Tour<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sescoops.com/news/wwe/our-lady-peace-performs-chris-benoits-wwe-theme-whatever-after-15-year-ban/|title=Our Lady Peace Performs Chris Benoit’s WWE Theme ‘Whatever’ After 15-Year Ban|first=Michael|last=Reichlin|publisher=SEScoops|publication-date=February 20, 2025|access-date=February 20, 2025}}</ref> and released a re-recorded version of the song.<ref name="WhateverRedux" />
