'''The Strokes''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[New York City]] in 1998. The band is composed of lead singer and primary songwriter [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarists [[Nick Valensi]] and [[Albert Hammond Jr.]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. They were a leading group of the early-2000s [[garage rock revival]] and [[post-punk revival]] movements.

The release of their debut EP ''[[The Modern Age]]'' in early 2001 sparked a [[bidding war]] among minor labels, with the band eventually signing to [[RCA Records]]. That summer, they released their debut album, ''[[Is This It]]'', to widespread critical acclaim and strong sales. It has since appeared on numerous "greatest albums" lists. It was followed by ''[[Room on Fire]]'' (2003) and ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' (2005), both of which sold well but failed to match ''Is This It'' in immediate critical success, despite positive reviews nonetheless.

Following a five-year hiatus, they released ''[[Angles (The Strokes album)|Angles]]'' (2011) and ''[[Comedown Machine]]'' (2013) to generally positive receptions but dwindling sales. Following the end of their initial contract with RCA, they released the ''[[Future Present Past]]'' EP (2016) through Casablancas' label [[Cult Records|Cult]]. The band were relatively inactive throughout the rest of the decade, making infrequent live appearances and directing most media attention to individual projects.

In 2020, they released their first studio album in seven years, ''[[The New Abnormal]]'', produced by [[Rick Rubin]] and released through Cult and RCA. The album received highly positive reviews and was considered a return to form by critics. It went on to win [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] at the [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/the-strokes-win-best-rock-album-at-2021-grammys/|title=The Strokes Win Best Rock Album at 2021 Grammys|author=Madison Bloom|publisher=Pitchfork|date=March 14, 2021|access-date=2021-03-14}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and ''The Modern Age'' EP (1998–2001)===
{{See also|The Modern Age}}
Lead singer-songwriter [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarist [[Nick Valensi]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]] started playing together as teenagers while all of them were attending [[Dwight School]] in Manhattan, and formed an informal band in 1997. They later added bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]] to their ranks, a close childhood friend of Casablancas who had attended the [[Lycée Français de New York]] with him. At the end of 1998, the group invited guitarist [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]] to play with them.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Goodman|first=Lizzy|title=[[Meet Me in the Bathroom (book)|Meet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001–2011]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]/Dey St.|year=2017|isbn=978-0-06-223309-7|location=New York|pages=109–118|chapter=These Guys All Go So Far Back}}</ref> He had just moved to New York City and reconnected with Casablancas, whom he knew from their brief stints at the private boarding school [[Institut Le Rosey]], near [[Nyon]], Switzerland. At this point, he was the last member to join the band. The two soon became roommates not long after reconnecting, with Hammond remarking that "two weeks later, we were sharing a flat."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Simpson |first=Dave |last2=Simpson |first2=Interview by Dave |date=2015-03-24 |title=The Strokes: how we made Is This It |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/24/how-we-made-is-this-it-the-strokes |access-date=2024-11-02 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In the following two years, the band practiced and performed tirelessly in New York City. Many of their contemporaries have credited the band's earliest successes to their dedication and hustle, as well as their engaging personalities.<ref name=":0" /> They practiced most nights, with many rehearsals taking place in [[The Music Building]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. They played their first show as the Strokes on September 14, 1999, at The Spiral.<ref name=":0" /> They soon frequented Manhattan's rock clubs including HiFi Bar and the [[Luna Lounge]] on the Lower East Side of New York, and later Manhattan's popular [[Mercury Lounge]]. A young booker for the Mercury Lounge, [[Ryan Gentles (music manager)|Ryan Gentles]], eventually quit his job to become the band's manager.<ref>Bush, B. (August 2002). The strokes. Music Connection, 26, 32–35.</ref>

The band began rehearsing a 14-song set (an early blueprint of the Strokes' 2001 debut, ''Is This It''), including "Alone, Together", "Barely Legal", "[[Last Nite]]", "The Modern Age", "New York City Cops", "Soma", "[[Someday (The Strokes song)|Someday]]", "Take It or Leave It", and "This Life" (an early version of "Trying Your Luck"). Most of these songs now feature different lyrics. The band connected with producer [[Gordon Raphael]] in 2000 following a show at Luna Lounge and made a demo, [[The Modern Age|''The Modern Age'' EP]], with him. The band sent the demo to the newly reformed [[Rough Trade Records]] in the UK, sparking interest there, and leading to their first release (via the website of the UK magazine, ''[[NME]],'' who gave away a free MP3 download of "[[Last Nite]]" a week prior to the physical release as part of ''The Modern Age'' EP in 2001). The EP sparked a bidding war among record labels, the largest for a rock band in years.<ref name="MTV">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=4690|title=The Strokes: "We Just Do Our Own Thing"|website=MTVe.com|access-date=January 23, 2007|year=2001|author=Joe D'Angelo|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211070125/http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=4690|archive-date=February 11, 2007}}</ref> In August 2001, the Strokes made their first appearance on the cover of the publication ''[[The Fader]]'' in its ninth issue.<ref>{{cite magazine

===''Is This It''  (2001–2002) ===
{{Main|Is This It|label1=''Is This It''}}
[[File:The Strokes by Roger Woolman.jpg|thumb|right|The Strokes in 2002]]
The Strokes released their debut album, ''[[Is This It]],'' in Australia in July 2001, and in Japan and the UK in August 2001 before the release of a subsequent US version in October 2001. The Australia, Japan and UK dates coincided with promotional tours in the respective countries.  These included the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] at which the band were moved up the billing twice due to rapidly growing interest, shifted from being due to play on a tented stage to a slot on the main stage,<ref>BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1505773.stm on August 23, 2001 </ref> that attracted their largest audiences up to this point.

The album was produced by Gordon Raphael, as was their follow-up album ''[[Room On Fire]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/music/the-strokes-producer-gordon-raphael-on-the-chances-of-the-band-celebrating-20-years-of-is-this-it-2887243 |title=The Strokes Producer Gordon Raphael on the Chances of the Band Celebrating 20 Years of ''Is This It'' |magazine=[[NME]] |access-date=May 14, 2023}}</ref> [[RCA Records]] delayed the North American (US) release over concerns with the album's cover and lyrics. The internationally released cover features a black-and-white photo of a gloved hand on a woman's naked backside, shown in semi-profile (photographer Colin Lane's then-girlfriend)<ref>The strokes: Never mind the buttocks ... (August 12, 2006). ''NME'' – ''New Musical Express'', 27.</ref> while the North American version replaced it with a photo of particle collisions in the [[Big European Bubble Chamber]]. RCA replaced the track "New York City Cops" with "When It Started", as the former featured potentially inflammatory lyrics in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. The track "New York City Cops"—featuring the refrain, "New York City Cops, they ain't too smart"—was listed as No. 12 on ''New York'' magazine's "Ultimate New York Playlist" on March 1, 2010. Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), ''Is This It'' received critical acclaim—among other accolades, four stars from ''Rolling Stone'', and a 9.1 from [[Pitchfork Media]]. The album made many critics' top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by ''Entertainment Weekly'' and ''Time'', and (in an article previewing summer concerts) ''[[NME]]'' urged readers to attend The Strokes' shows—as they were touring some of the "best pop songs ever". While critics noted the influence of [[CBGB]] stalwarts [[Television (band)|Television]], Casablancas and bandmates said they had never heard the band, instead citing [[the Velvet Underground]] and [[the Doors]] as reference points.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5933812/the_strokes_of_genius/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401170454/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5933812/the_strokes_of_genius|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 1, 2010|title=The Strokes of Genius|last=Eliscu|first=Jenny|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=April 11, 2002|access-date=November 20, 2009}}</ref>

After the release of ''Is This It'', the band toured around the world—including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and North America (the band opened for the [[Rolling Stones]] on numerous occasions during the North American leg of their tour). The self-made mini-documentary "In Transit" was filmed during the summer tour of Europe. In August 2002, the band headlined the UK's [[Carling Weekend]] festivals for the second time, subsequently playing at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]] on a bill with [[the White Stripes]]. [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] joined The Strokes on stage to perform the guitar solo on "New York City Cops". During that period, the band also appeared as musical guests on numerous late-night talk shows. ''Is This It'' yielded several singles and music videos, all of which were directed by [[Roman Coppola]].

''Is This It'' has had an enduring impact on fans and critics alike. In 2009, ''NME'' named ''Is This It'' as the Greatest Album of the Decade (2000s).<ref>{{cite web|last=Fullerton|first=Jamie|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-strokes-174-1308681 |title=The Strokes' 'Is This It' tops NME albums of the decade list |work=NME |date=November 17, 2009 |access-date=January 9, 2023}}</ref> The album placed second on a similar list compiled by ''Rolling Stone'' (the same issue featured a list of the '100 Best Songs of the 00s', featuring "[[Hard to Explain]]" and "[[Last Nite]]"  at Nos.&nbsp;59 and&nbsp;16, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|last=Singh |first=Amrit |url=https://stereogum.com/105081/rolling_stones_100_best_albums_songs_of_the_00s/list/ |title=Rolling Stone's 100 Best Albums, Songs of The '00s |website=Stereogum |date=December 10, 2009 |access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref> In January 2011, Rolling Stone surveyed their Facebook fans to determine the top ten debut albums of all time.

The group began recording their follow-up in 2002 with producer [[Nigel Godrich]] (best known for his work with [[Radiohead]]), but later split with him in favor of Gordon Raphael, the producer of ''Is This It''. Recordings with Godrich were never revealed.<ref>Molenda, M. (2003, 12). Electric warriors: The strokes' albert hammond, jr. and nick valensi play it like it is.

The band also played [[Paul Anka]]'s "My Way" with Japanese lyrics. The Strokes released their second album ''[[Room on Fire]]'' in October 2003. It received praise from critics but was less commercially successful, although it still went gold. The album's sound maintained The Strokes' familiar reference points,<ref name="spinrca"/> while also evoking groups such as [[the Cars]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mitchum |first1=Rob |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7538-room-on-fire/ |title=The Strokes: Room on Fire |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=October 26, 2003 |access-date=June 25, 2019}}</ref> [[Bob Marley]],<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Tyrangiel |first1=Josh |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,524476,00.html |title=Different Strokes? |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |date=October 19, 2003 |access-date=June 25, 2019 |archive-date=December 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222181605/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,524476,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]].<ref name="spinrca">{{cite magazine|last1=Milner |first1=Greg |url=https://www.spin.com/2003/11/strokes-room-fire-rca/ |title=The Strokes, 'Room on Fire' (RCA) |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=November 21, 2003 |access-date=June 25, 2019}}</ref> In the process, they made the cover of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin Magazine]]'' for the second time, with each member receiving his own cover. They also made the cover of ''Rolling Stone'' for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress [[Drew Barrymore]], which ended in January 2007. The first single taken from ''Room on Fire'' was the song "[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]", which used distinct keyboard-like sounds produced by Valensi's guitar. The video was also directed by Roman Coppola, and was inspired by the futuristic look of the 1980s film ''[[Tron]]''. This consisted of a mainly black scene, with instances of glowing picton blue and riptide.

In November 2003, The Strokes played on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', performing "[[Reptilia (song)|Reptilia]]", "What Ever Happened", "Under Control" and "I Can't Win".<ref>DeRogatis, J.

While on tour, Spektor and The Strokes recorded the song "[[Modern Girls & Old Fashion Men]]", released as a B-side on the "Reptilia" single. Also during the tour, the band included [[the Clash]]'s "Clampdown" as a cover, which was released as the B-side for "[[The End Has No End]]".

In late 2004, The Strokes revealed plans to release a live album. The ''Live in London'' LP was planned for release in October 2004, but was abandoned, reportedly due to recording quality problems. The chosen gig was one held at the legendary [[Alexandra Palace]] in North London.

=== ''First Impressions of Earth'' and hiatus (2005–2007) ===

In late September 2005, "[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]", the first single from The Strokes' then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single's release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. "Juicebox" became The Strokes' second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 The Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world. Their third album, ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'', was released on January 3, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/first-impressions-of-earth-mw0000339306 |title=First Impressions of Earth - The Strokes |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> It received mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the U.S. and number one in the UK, the latter being a first for the band. In Japan, it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was "like a scientific breakthrough". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' playing "Juicebox" and "[[You Only Live Once (song)|You Only Live Once]]". The album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne.<ref>Marchese, D. (January 2006).

The Village Voice, 51, C81.</ref> Despite its initial strong sales, ''First Impressions of Earth'' received the worst reception, both commercially and critically, of all their albums.

In 2006, the band played eighteen sold-out shows during their UK tour. In February 2006, The Strokes won "Best International Band" at the NME Awards. In March, the band returned to the U.S. with their longest tour yet. The second single off ''First Impressions of Earth'', "Heart in a Cage", was released in March 2006. During the summer of 2006, The Strokes played several festival dates in Europe, including the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark, the [[Oxegen Festival]] in Ireland, the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, the FIB ([[Festival Internacional de Benicàssim]]), [[Fuji Rock Festival]] and headlined the [[Pentaport Rock Festival]] in South Korea. They then toured Australia and Mexico in late August and early September, followed by the second leg of the United States tour. While in the U.S., The Strokes opened for [[Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers]] for five shows during their Highway Companion tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2006/07/tom-petty-adds-sept-dates-strokes-frank-black/ |title=Tom Petty Adds Sept.

During this final tour, Casablancas stated to fans that the band would be taking an extensive break after it finished. An e-mail was sent out soon afterwards by Strokes manager [[Ryan Gentles (music manager)|Ryan Gentles]], confirming that "much needed break". A new band website went online in May 2007 along with the release of an alternate video to their single "You Only Live Once" directed by [[Warren Fu]]. The video also featured a brief interlude with "Ize of the World", also from ''First Impressions of Earth''. The song "You Talk Way Too Much" was used in a commercial for the Ford Sync. Aleksandra Cisneros became The Strokes' assistant manager in late 2007.

This album would be different from the first three due to the fact that the music for the album would also be written by the other four Strokes, rather than Casablancas writing a majority share of the material once again: "It's supercollaborative, and it sounds different," said Valensi, "but it has a Strokes vibe to it."<ref>Scaggs, A.
