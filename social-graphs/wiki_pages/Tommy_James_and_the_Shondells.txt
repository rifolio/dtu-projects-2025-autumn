'''Tommy James and the Shondells''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Niles, Michigan]], in 1964.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Patricia Romanowski|author2=Holly George-Warren|author3=John Pareles|title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uU9AAQA6kAMC|date=November 8, 2001|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=9780743201209|page=483}}</ref> The band has had two [[chart-topper|No. 1]] [[single (music)|singles]] in the U.S.: "[[Hanky Panky (Tommy James and the Shondells song)|Hanky Panky]]" (1966), the band's only RIAA Certified Gold record, and "[[Crimson and Clover]]" (1969). The band also charted twelve other [[top 40]] hits, including five in the Hot 100's Top 10: "[[I Think We're Alone Now]]" (1967), "[[Mirage (Tommy James and the Shondells song)|Mirage]]" (1967), "[[Mony Mony]]" (1968), "[[Sweet Cherry Wine]]" (1969), and "[[Crystal Blue Persuasion]]" (1969).<ref>{{cite book|title=Top Pop Singles|author=Joel Whitburn|publisher=Record Research|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/349 349–350]|isbn=0-89820-155-1|url=https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/349}}</ref>

==History==

===Origins===

[[File:Tommy James and the Shondells.png|thumb|right|250px|Tommy James and the Shondells in 1967. Left to right: Ron Rosman, Peter Lucia, Tommy James, Mike Vale and Eddie Gray]]
The band The Echoes formed in 1959 in [[Niles, Michigan]], then evolved into Tom and the Tornadoes, with 12-year-old [[Tommy James]] (then known as Tommy Jackson) as lead singer. While attending [[Niles High School]] in Niles, Michigan, the group released its first single, "Long Pony Tail", in 1962.<ref name="Shondells 2006">Tommy James and the Shondells. ''40 Years: The Complete Singles Collection (1966–2006)''. CD booklet. Aura Records, 2008.</ref>

In 1964, James renamed the band the Shondells<ref name="AllMusic" /> because the name "sounded good" and in honor of nearby [[Fort Wayne]]'s own [[Troy Shondell]], famous for his 1961 release "[[This_Time_(Thomas_Wayne_song)|This Time]]". At this time, the band included Tommy James (vocals and guitar), Larry Coverdale (lead guitar), Larry Wright (bass), Craig Villeneuve (keyboards) and Jim Payne (drums). In February 1964 the band recorded the [[Jeff Barry]]–[[Ellie Greenwich]] song "[[Hanky Panky (Tommy James and the Shondells song)|Hanky Panky]]" (originally a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] by [[the Raindrops]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/hanky-panky-mt0030108954 |title=Hanky Panky: The Raindrops &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |website=AllMusic |date=2008-08-25 |access-date=2015-08-19}}</ref>). As James could often be found playing at Niles High School events, his popularity locally continued to grow. James' version of "Hanky Panky" sold respectably in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, but Snap Records, the label under which "Hanky Panky" was originally released, had no national distribution. The band toured the eastern Midwest, but no other market took to the song. The single failed to [[record chart|chart]] nationally and the Shondells disbanded in 1965 after its members graduated from high school.

After first considering taking a job outside of music, James decided to form a new band, the Koachmen, with Shondells guitarist Larry Coverdale and members of a rival group called the Spinners (not [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the hit-making group from Detroit]]). The Koachmen played a circuit of clubs in the Midwest through the summer and fall of 1965, but returned to Niles in February 1966, after the gigs dried up, to plot their next move.

===Hanky Panky===

Meanwhile, in 1965, [[Pittsburgh]] dance promoter Bob Mack had unearthed the forgotten single "Hanky Panky", playing it at various dance parties, and radio stations there touted it as an "exclusive". Listener response encouraged regular play and demand soared. Bootleggers responded by printing 80,000 black market copies of the recording, which were sold in Pennsylvania stores.

James first learned of all of this activity in April 1966, after getting a telephone call from Pittsburgh disc jockey "Mad Mike" Metro(vich), who asked him to come and perform the song. James attempted to contact other members of the Shondells, but they had all moved away, joined the service or gotten married and left the music business altogether. There remains disagreement over the role of Metrovich in the recording. In his book, ''Me, The Mob and the Music'', James credits Pittsburgh dance promoter Bob Mack and never mentions Metrovich.

In April 1966, James went by himself to make promotional appearances in Pittsburgh in nightclubs and on local television. Bob Mack made his dance club bands available to James for promotional appearances, but nothing seemed to fit until a guitarist from one of the bands took James to the Thunderbird Lounge in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]], where he recruited a quintet that was playing there called the Raconteurs – Joe Kessler (guitar), Ron Rosman (keyboards), George Magura (saxophone and piano), Mike Vale (bass) and Vincent Pietropaoli (drums) – as the new Shondells.<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tommy-james-the-shondells-mn0000520975/biography|title=Tommy James & the Shondells Biography|first=Mark|last=Deming|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> "I had no group, and I had to put one together really fast," recalled James. "I was in a Greensburg, PA club one night, and I walked up to a group that was playing that I thought was pretty good and asked them if they wanted to be the Shondells. They said yes, and off we went."<ref>{{cite book | last = Bronson | first = Fred | author-link = Fred_Bronson | title = The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, Fifth Edition | page = 203 | publisher = Billboard Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0823076776 | oclc = 52727714}}</ref>

With a touring group to promote the single, James went to New York City, where he sold the [[master recording|master]] of "Hanky Panky" to [[Roulette Records]], at which time he changed his last name to James. With national promotion, the single became a No. 1 hit in July 1966. He signed with [[Leonard Stogel]] and Associates for management. In 1967, Kessler and Pietropaoli were forced to leave after a dispute when planned monies were not remitted to them by Roulette, a label closely associated with organized crime, and whose head, [[Morris Levy]], was the inspiration for the [[Herman "Hesh" Rabkin]] character on ''[[The Sopranos]]''. They were replaced by Eddie Gray (guitar) and Peter Lucia (drums); Magura departed as well.<ref name="AllMusic"/>

===Tommy James and the Shondells===
At first, Tommy James and "his" Shondells played straightforward rock and roll, but they soon became associated with the budding [[Bubblegum pop|bubblegum music]] genre. James disputes this, saying that [[Super K Productions]] "bubblegum" producers [[Jerry Kasenetz]] and [[Jeffry Katz]] approached his record company (run by [[Morris Levy]]) looking for songwriting jobs. Levy spurned Kasenetz and Katz, so they went elsewhere and became successful with such bands as the [[1910 Fruitgum Company]]. [[Bubblegum music|Bubblegum]] is generally traced to the success of the 1968 Fruitgum Company hit "Simon Says". Tommy rejects the "bubblegum" label for his music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BORYPYU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1|title=Me, the Mob, and the Music: One Helluva Ride with Tommy James & The Shondells|first=Tommy|last=James|date=16 February 2010|access-date=12 June 2021|website=Amazon.com}}</ref> In early 1967 songwriter [[Ritchie Cordell]] gave them the No. 4 hit "[[I Think We're Alone Now]]" and the No. 10 hit "[[Mirage (Tommy James and the Shondells song)|Mirage]]". In 1968, James had a No. 3 hit with "[[Mony Mony]]". Co-written by James, Cordell, Cordell's writing partner [[Bo Gentry]], and [[Bobby Bloom]], "Mony Mony" reached No. 3 in the US and was a British No. 1 in 1968. The title was inspired by a flashing sign for '''M'''utual '''O'''f '''N'''ew '''Y'''ork visible from James's apartment balcony in New York.<ref name="Shondells 2006"/> He followed it with "[[Do Something to Me]]". The ''[[Crimson & Clover (album)|Crimson & Clover]]'' album marked the start of the band's psychedelic style.<ref name=Ruhlmann/>

The group toured with Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] during his 1968 [[presidential campaign]], for which Humphrey showed his appreciation by writing the liner notes for their next album ''Crimson & Clover'', which was released in December 1968.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tommyjames.com/biography.php|title=Tommy James & the Shondells Official Website|publisher=Tommyjames.com|access-date=October 28, 2009}}</ref> From late 1968, the group began writing their own songs, with James and Lucia penning the psychedelic-tinged classic "[[Crimson and Clover]]", which was recorded and mixed by Bruce Staple, with James tackling vocal duties and playing many of the instruments himself, and featured the creative use of studio effects such as delay and tremolo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun10/articles/classictracks_0610.htm |title=Tommy James & The Shondells 'Crimson & Clover' - Classic Tracks |last=Buskin |first=Richard |publisher=SOS Publications Group |date=June 2010 |website=Sound On Sound |access-date=7 July 2015}}</ref>

Further hits included "[[Sweet Cherry Wine]]", "[[Crystal Blue Persuasion]]", and "[[Ball of Fire (song)|Ball of Fire]]", all from 1969. They also produced "Sugar on Sunday", later covered by [[The Clique (Texas band)|the Clique]]. As the band embraced the sounds of psychedelia, they were invited to perform at [[Woodstock]], but declined. [[Image:Tommy James and the Shondells 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 2000s edition of Tommy James and the Shondells plays a 2010 free outdoor concert in [[Manalapan Township, New Jersey]]]]

The group continued until 1970.<ref>{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| pages= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/206 206, 224, 242 & 262]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/206}}</ref>

=== Hog Heaven ===
At a concert in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in March 1970, an exhausted James collapsed after coming off stage from a reaction to drugs and was pronounced dead. He was not dead, however, and decided to move to the country to rest and recuperate, and left the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://djallyn.org/archives/437 |title=Djallyn.org |publisher=Djallyn.org |access-date=2011-03-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122003321/http://djallyn.org/archives/437 |archive-date=2010-11-22 }}</ref> His four bandmates carried on for a short while under the name Hog Heaven, recording two albums (one "self-titled" on Roulette Records in March 1971 and the second recorded in 1971, but unreleased until 2008), and landing one Hot 100 hit, "[[Happy (Hog Heaven song)|Happy]]", at number 98, but disbanded soon afterwards.

In a 1970 side project, James wrote and produced the No. 7 hit single "Tighter, Tighter" for the group [[Alive N Kickin']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/tighter-tighter-mt0003155463 |title=Tighter, Tighter - Alive 'N Kickin' &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |website=AllMusic |access-date=2015-08-19}}</ref> James launched a solo career in 1970 that yielded two notable hits over a 10-year span, "[[Draggin' the Line]]" (1971) and "Three Times in Love" (1980).

===Covers by other artists===
During the 1980s, the group's songbook produced major hits for three other artists: [[Joan Jett & The Blackhearts]]' version of "Crimson and Clover" (No. 7 in 1982), [[Tiffany Darwish|Tiffany's]] "I Think We're Alone Now" and [[Billy Idol]]'s "Mony Mony" (back-to-back No. 1 singles in November 1987).<ref name="Grdn">{{cite news |last1=Simpson |first1=Dave |title=How we made I Think We're Alone Now: Tommy James and Tiffany on their shared hit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/30/tommy-james-shondells-tiffany-how-we-made-i-think-were-alone-now |access-date=20 September 2023 |publisher=The Guardian |date=30 July 2019}}</ref> Other Shondells covers have been performed by acts as disparate as psychobilly ravers [[the Cramps]], [[New wave music|new wave]] singer [[Lene Lovich]], country music veteran [[Dolly Parton]], and the [[Boston Pops]] orchestra.

===1980s and later===
In the mid-1980s, Tommy James began touring in oldies packages with other acts from the 1960s sometimes billed as Tommy James & the Shondells, although he is the group's only original member. A [[Greenwich Village]] nightclub appearance was filmed and released as ''Tommy James & the Shondells: Live! At [[The Bitter End]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/211726/Tommy-James-the-Shondells-Live-At-the-Bitter-End/overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226220826/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/211726/Tommy-James-the-Shondells-Live-At-the-Bitter-End/overview |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 26, 2009 |title=Tommy James & the Shondells: Live!

On January 6, 1987, original drummer Peter P. Lucia Jr. died of a heart attack while playing golf at the age of 39.

In 2008, "I'm Alive" was covered by [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and released on his ''24 Hours'' album.

In 2009, James and the surviving Shondells, Gray, Vale and Rosman, reunited to record music for a soundtrack of a proposed film based on James's autobiography, ''Me, the Mob, and the Music'', released in February 2010. 

In March 2011, the Tommy James song "I'm Alive" (co-written with Peter Lucia) became a top-20 hit in the Netherlands for UK singer [[Don Fardon]] after his version had been used in a [[Vodafone]] commercial. 

In 2012, "Crystal Blue Persuasion" was used in the eighth episode of Season 5 of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', "[[Gliding Over All]]", during a montage depicting the process involved to bring main character [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]]'s methamphetamine operation and its signature blue crystal meth to an international level.

In 2015, Gray, Vale, and Rosman decided to reunite and form their new group, The Crystal Blue Band. They recruited their longtime friend and drummer Mike Wilps to replace the late Peter Lucia.  That group disbanded in 2022.

==Recognition==
In 2008, Tommy James and The Shondells were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref name="michiganrockandrolllegends.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/90-tommy-james-and-the-shondells |title=Tommy James and the Shondells |website=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends |access-date=October 9, 2019}}</ref>
