'''Deftones''' is an American [[alternative metal]] band <!-- DON'T mention the Grammy Award in the first sentence -->formed in [[Sacramento, California]], in 1988. They were formed by frontman [[Chino Moreno]], lead guitarist [[Stephen Carpenter]] and drummer [[Abe Cunningham]], with bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] and keyboardist and turntablist [[Frank Delgado (American musician)|Frank Delgado]] joining the lineup in 1990 and 1999, respectively. The band's [[experimental rock|experimental]] nature has led some critics to describe them as "the [[Radiohead]] of metal".<ref name="insinginterview">{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Cherylene |title=Deftones' Abe Cunningham: "We just let things happen, for better or worse" |url=https://www.insing.com/feature/interview-deftones-abe-cunningham-we-just-let-things-happen-for-better-or-worse/id-d7743f00/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705235121/https://www.insing.com/feature/interview-deftones-abe-cunningham-we-just-let-things-happen-for-better-or-worse/id-d7743f00/ |archive-date=July 5, 2017 |access-date=May 4, 2018 |publisher=Insing.com |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="nmebeaumont" />

After the lineup settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with [[Maverick Records]], and subsequently released their debut album ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' in 1995. Extensive touring and [[word-of-mouth]] promotion of the album helped Deftones garner a dedicated fan base. Their second album, ''[[Around the Fur]]'' (1997), brought the band fame among the alternative metal scene and reached chart positions along with its singles. It became the band's first record to receive certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

The band found further success with their third album ''[[White Pony]]'' (2000), which marked a transition from their earlier, more aggressive sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single "[[Change (In the House of Flies)]]" is the band's most commercially successful single, and the track "[[Elite (song)|Elite]]" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]]; it was also the band's first of three albums to be certified platinum in the United States. Their [[Deftones (album)|self-titled fourth album]] was released in 2003. While the group's critical success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to ''White Pony''. Deftones' fifth studio effort, ''[[Saturday Night Wrist]]'' (2006), received similar praise, although the album's production was marred by creative tensions and personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material.

In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled ''[[Eros (Deftones album)|Eros]]'', Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a [[minimally conscious state]] until his death in 2013 of [[cardiac arrest]]. After Cheng's accident, Deftones halted production on ''Eros'' and recruited [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]] bassist [[Sergio Vega (bassist)|Sergio Vega]] until his departure in early 2021.{{efn|Despite appearing in promotional material during his tenure, Vega disputes his status as a full time member of the band, claiming that he was a member of the band only under contract.<ref name="Sergio Vega1">{{ Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/deftones-sergio-vega-quit-1318765/|title=Why Deftones Bassist Sergio Vega Quit: 'There Was No Opportunity for Growth'|first=Kory|last=Grow|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 9, 2022|access-date=February 13, 2024}}</ref><ref name="Sergio Vega2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/deftones-part-ways-with-longtime-bassist-sergio-vega/|title=Deftones Part Ways With Longtime Bassist Sergio Vega|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=March 9, 2022|access-date=March 9, 2022|language=en-US}}</ref>}} The band released the critically praised ''[[Diamond Eyes]]'' in 2010 and embarked on a [[Blackdiamondskye|triple-headline tour]] with [[Alice in Chains]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] throughout North America. Their seventh and eighth albums, ''[[Koi No Yokan]]'' (2012) and ''[[Gore (Deftones album)|Gore]]'' (2016) respectively, showcased the band's continued experimentation, while their ninth album, ''[[Ohms (album)|Ohms]]'' (2020), marked a return to the band's heavier sound. Their tenth album, ''[[Private Music (album)|Private Music]]'', was released on August 22, 2025.

===Early years (1988–1993)===
When [[Stephen Carpenter]] was 15 years old, he was hit by a car while [[skateboarding]].

Regarding the recording of the album, Cunningham said, "At the time we did the first record—which I really like and think is good—you can tell the band was really young.

Deftones' second album, ''[[Around the Fur]]'', was recorded at Studio Litho in [[Seattle, Washington]] and produced by Date. Released on October 28, 1997, the album was dedicated to Dana Wells, the late stepson of the singer [[Max Cavalera]] of [[Sepultura]], [[Soulfly]] and [[Cavalera Conspiracy]]. Cavalera also collaborated on "Headup", a tribute to Wells.<ref>Interview with Chino Moreno and Max Cavalera, ''[[Metal Hammer]]'', September 1997.</ref> Although not yet a member of the band, Delgado was credited as "audio" on five of the album's tracks.

"When we went in to make this record, we really didn't have a set idea of what we wanted to come out with", said Moreno in a 1998 interview with ''Chart'' magazine. However, he felt that the album "fell into place" once the band had settled into the studio.<ref name="chart">Bromley, Adrian.

An interview with the band in ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' described the recording process of ''White Pony''. After a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording it, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno said that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of "[[Change (In the House of Flies)]]" was the turning point where the band began working as a unit. Despite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time. Cheng explained, "We didn't feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make." Moreno did not have an overall lyrical theme in mind, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics: "I basically didn't sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things".<ref name="AP">Deftones&nbsp;– Ride On [interview]. ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', August 2000.</ref>

The album was originally released as an 11-track edition beginning with "Feiticeira" and ending with "Pink Maggit", and featuring gray cover art. A limited-edition print of 50,000 black-and-red jewel case versions of ''White Pony'' was released at the same time with a bonus twelfth track titled "The Boy's Republic".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Garrity|first1=Brian|date=June 10, 2000|title=Deftones have high hopes for ambitious third Maverick album|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mg8EAAAAMBAJ&q=white+pony+cover+art+releases&pg=PA14|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|volume=112|issue=24|pages=14|access-date=September 2, 2016}}</ref> Later, the band released "[[Back to School (Mini Maggit)]]", a rap-influenced interpretation of "Pink Maggit". The song was released as a single and included as the new opening track of a re-released ''White Pony'' on October 3, 2000. The new release still had "Pink Maggit" as the final track and featured altered white cover art. Not entirely happy with re-releasing the album, the band negotiated to have "Back to School" made available as a free download for anyone who had already bought the original album. Moreno noted that "Everybody's already downloaded our record before it came out anyway, otherwise I'd be kind of feelin' like, 'Man, why [are] we putting [out] all these different versions of the record?' [...] that's the best way we can actually get this song out to the people who already purchased this record, for free basically. And if they wanna buy the record again, it's cool".<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Lash, Jolie |date=September 16, 2000 |title=The Deftones Add New Single to "White Pony" |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/deftones/articles/story/5925471/the_deftones_add_new_single_to_white_pony |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=December 23, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510070709/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/deftones/articles/story/5925471/the_deftones_add_new_single_to_white_pony |archive-date=May 10, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>

On June 23, 2009, Deftones announced on their official website that ''Eros'' would be delayed indefinitely, saying, "As we neared completion on ''Eros'', we realized that this record doesn't best encompass and represent who we are currently as people and as musicians. And although those songs will see the light of day at some point, we collectively made the decision that we needed to take a new approach, and with Chi's condition heavy on our minds while doing so. We needed to return to the studio to do what we felt was right artistically". They also said, "The decision to hold off on releasing ''Eros'' has no connection with Chi's condition or anything associated. This was, and is, purely a creative decision by the band to write, record, and deliver an amazing product".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=426076934&blogId=496618043 |title=Deftones myspace blog entry for June 24, 2009 |date=June 24, 2009 |access-date=January 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808225931/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=426076934&blogId=496618043 |archive-date=August 8, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>

On March 15, Deftones debuted their first radio-ready single, "[[Diamond Eyes (song)|Diamond Eyes]]".

Teaming up with bands [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] and Alice in Chains, Deftones went on tour in the fall of 2010 in the United States and Canada.

The tour included a limited edition series of silk-screened art prints promoting each show individually, created by the poster artist [[Jermaine Rogers]].

And also making it sound dimensional. Giving the feeling off that it is raw and it is emotional, but it's not just connected with our personal story. It's not merely about our career and our lives, it's bigger than that.
