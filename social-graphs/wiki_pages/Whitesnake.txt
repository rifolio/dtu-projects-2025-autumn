'''Whitesnake''' are<!-- Per WP:ENGVAR, bands are treated plural in the British English criteria. Therefore, "are" should NOT be changed to "is". --> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1978. The group were originally put together as the backing band for singer [[David Coverdale]], who had recently left [[Deep Purple]]. Though the band quickly developed into their own entity, Coverdale is the only constant member throughout their history.

Following the ''[[Snakebite (album)|Snakebite]]'' EP in 1978, Whitesnake released the albums ''[[Trouble (Whitesnake album)|Trouble]]'' (1978) and ''[[Lovehunter]]'' (1979), which included the live staples "[[Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City]]" and "Walking in the Shadow of the Blues". Whitesnake soon began to make a name for themselves across the UK, Europe and Japan, with their subsequent albums ''[[Ready an' Willing]]'' (1980), ''[[Live... in the Heart of the City]]'' (1980), ''[[Come an' Get It]]'' (1981) and ''[[Saints & Sinners (Whitesnake album)|Saints & Sinners]]'' (1982) all reaching the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. By the mid-1980s, Coverdale had set his sights on North America, where Whitesnake remained largely unknown. With the backing of American label [[Geffen Records]], Whitesnake released ''[[Slide It In]]'' in 1984, featuring the singles "[[Love Ain't No Stranger]]" and "[[Slow an' Easy]]", which furthered the band's exposure through heavy airplay on [[MTV]]. In 1987, Whitesnake released their [[eponymous]] album, titled ''[[Whitesnake (album)|1987]]'' in the UK, their biggest success to date, selling over eight million copies in the [[United States]] and spawning the hit singles "[[Here I Go Again]]", "[[Is This Love (Whitesnake song)|Is This Love]]" and "[[Still of the Night (song)|Still of the Night]]". Whitesnake also adopted a more contemporary look, akin to the Los Angeles [[glam metal]] scene.

After releasing ''[[Slip of the Tongue]]'' in 1989, Coverdale decided to take a break from the music industry. Aside from a few short-lived reunions related to the release of ''[[Greatest Hits (Whitesnake album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1994) and ''[[Restless Heart (Whitesnake album)|Restless Heart]]'' (1997), Whitesnake remained mostly inactive until 2003, when Coverdale put together a new line-up to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary. Since then Whitesnake have released four more studio albums ''[[Good to Be Bad]]'' (2008), ''[[Forevermore (Whitesnake album)|Forevermore]]'' (2011), ''[[The Purple Album (Whitesnake album)|The Purple Album]]'' (2015), ''[[Flesh & Blood (Whitesnake album)|Flesh & Blood]]'' (2019) and toured extensively around the world.

Whitesnake's early sound has been characterised by critics as [[blues rock]], but by the mid-1980s the band slowly began moving toward a more commercially accessible hard rock style. Topics such as love and sex are common in Whitesnake's lyrics, which make frequent use of sexual innuendos and double entendres. Whitesnake have been nominated for several awards during their career, including Best British Group at the [[1988 Brit Awards]]. They have also been featured on lists of the greatest hard rock bands of all time by several media outlets,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=62184 |title=Ep. 036 &#124; 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock – Hour 1 &#124; The Greatest &#124; Episode Summary, Highlights, and Recaps |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605050813/http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=62184#moreinfo |url-status=dead |publisher=VH1.com |access-date=24 April 2014 |archive-date=5 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/09/21/top-25-hard-rock-acts-of-all-time-where-does-your-favorite-rank/ |title= Top 25 Hard Rock acts of all time: Where does your favorite rank? |publisher=The Mercury News |first1=Tony |last1=Hicks |first2=Jim |last2=Harrington |date=21 September 2015 |access-date=24 April 2014}}</ref> while their songs and albums have appeared on many "best of" lists by outlets, such as [[VH1]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2006/vh180s.htm |title=VH1: 100 Greatest Songs of the 80's |website=Rock on the Net |access-date=1 March 2021}}</ref><ref name="50Greatest">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-hair-metal-albums-of-all-time-162362/tesla-the-great-radio-controversy-1989-165437/ |title= 50 Greatest Hair Metal Albums of All Time |last1=Beaujour |first1=Tom |last2= Bienstock |first2=Richard |last3= Eddy |first3=Chuck |last4=Fischer |first4=Reed |last5=Grow |first5=Kory |last6=Johnston |first6=Maura |author6-link=Maura Johnston |last7=Weingarten |first7=Christopher R. |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=31 August 2019 |access-date=11 February 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |date=20 June 2012 |title=Readers' Poll: The Best Hair Metal Songs of All Time |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/readers-poll-the-best-hair-metal-songs-of-all-time-12979/9-whitesnake-here-i-go-again-256356/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=1 March 2021}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Formation, ''Snakebite'' and ''Trouble'' (1976–1978) ===
In March 1976, singer [[David Coverdale]] left the English hard rock group [[Deep Purple]]. He had joined the band three years prior and recorded three successful albums with them. After leaving Deep Purple, Coverdale released his solo album ''[[White Snake (album)|White Snake]]'' in February 1977.{{refn|group=nb|''[[White Snake (album)|White Snake]]'' was initially released by [[Polydor Records]] on 22 February 1977, followed by a re-release in May through [[Purple Records]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/david-coverdale-solo-albums-white-snake-northwinds | title= "I have to prove that I'm capable of doing it, and I wasn't just being done a favour by Deep Purple": the two forgotten David Coverdale solo albums that sowed the seeds for Whitesnake |first=Neil |last=Jeffries |website=Louder | date=5 May 2024 | access-date=27 October 2024 }}</ref>{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=17}}}} His second solo album ''[[Northwinds]]'' was released in March 1978.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=22}} Both combined elements of blues, soul and funk, as Coverdale had wanted to distance himself from the hard rock sound synonymous with Deep Purple.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|pp=14, 16, 19}} Both records featured former [[Snafu (band)|Snafu]] guitarist [[Micky Moody]], whom Coverdale had known since the late 1960s.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=15}} Moody was the first to join Coverdale's backing band, which he began assembling in London.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|pp=23{{ndash}}24}}<ref name="Early1">{{Cite web| url=https://whitesnake.com/early-years-part-1/ | title= Early Years Part 1 | website=Whitesnake Official Site | date=4 January 2016 | access-date=11 February 2021 }}</ref> As stated by Coverdale, "Whitesnake were actually formed to promote ''Northwinds'' on a one-off promotional tour".<ref name="Vain"/> Moody suggested bringing in a second guitarist, with the spot ultimately going to [[Bernie Marsden]], formerly of [[UFO]] and [[Paice Ashton Lord]].<ref name="Early1"/>{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=24}} With his help, the band were able to recruit bassist [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]], who had played with Marsden in [[Cozy Powell]]'s Hammer.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=26}} The group's initial line-up was rounded out by drummer [[Dave Dowle|Dave "Duck" Dowle]] and keyboardist Brian Johnson, who had played together in [[Streetwalkers]].{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=27}} Other early candidates for the band were drummers Cozy Powell and [[Dave Holland (drummer)|Dave Holland]], as well as guitarist [[Mel Galley]].{{sfn|Popoff|2015|pp=27{{ndash}}28}}

The band, dubbed David Coverdale's Whitesnake, played their first show at [[University of Lincoln|Lincoln Technical College]] on 3 March 1978.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://whitesnake.com/first-show-march-3-1978/ | title=40 Years Ago Today – Whitesnake's First Show |website=Whitesnake Official Site | date=3 March 2018 | access-date=21 February 2021 }}</ref><ref name="UCR">{{Cite web| url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/whitesnake-first-concert/ | title=When Whitesnake Played Their First Concert |website=Ultimate Classic Rock | date=3 March 2016 | access-date=21 February 2021 }}</ref> Their live debut had originally been scheduled for 23 February at the Sky Bird Club in Nottingham, but the show was cancelled.<ref name="UCR"/>{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=29}} Coverdale had originally wanted the group to be simply called Whitesnake, but was forced to use his own name as it still carried some clout as the former lead singer of Deep Purple.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=14}}<ref name="Trouble">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Trouble |title-link=Trouble (Whitesnake album) |others=Whitesnake |date=2006 |first=Geoff |last=Barton |author-link=Geoff Barton |pages=2{{ndash}}11 |type=booklet |publisher=EMI |id=0946 3 59688 2 8}}</ref><ref name="Mars">{{cite magazine |last=Oliver |first=Derek |date=March 2011 |title=Life on Mars |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] presents: Whitesnake – Forevermore (The Official Album Magazine) |pages=72{{ndash}}77 |publisher=Future plc |location=London, England}}</ref> In a 2009 interview with [[Metro (British newspaper)|''Metro'']], Coverdale jokingly stated that the name "Whitesnake" was a euphemism for his penis.

After completing a small UK club tour, the band adjourned to a rehearsal place in London's West End to begin writing new songs.<ref name="Early1"/> They soon caught the attention of [[EMI International]]'s Robbie Dennis, who wanted to sign the group. According to Bernie Marsden, however, his higher-ups were not ready to commit to a full album. Thus, the band entered London's Central Recorders Studio in April 1978 to record an EP.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|pp=29{{ndash}}30}} By this point, original keyboardist Brian Johnston had been replaced by Pete Solley.<ref name="Trouble"/> [[Martin Birch]], who had worked with Coverdale during his time in Deep Purple, was chosen to produce.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=29}}

=== ''Lovehunter'' and ''Ready an' Willing'' (1979–1980) ===
Whitesnake embarked on their first continental European tour on 9 February 1979 in Germany.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=41}} In April, they began recording their second album at [[Clearwell Castle]] in [[Gloucestershire]], where Coverdale had previously worked with Deep Purple.

Before the record's release, drummer Dave "Duck" Dowle was replaced by [[Ian Paice]], Coverdale and Lord's former Deep Purple bandmate.<ref name="Ready">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Ready an' Willing |title-link=Ready an' Willing |others=Whitesnake |date=2006 |first=Geoff |last=Barton |author-link=Geoff Barton |pages=2{{ndash}}9 |type=booklet |publisher=EMI |id=0946 359692 2 1}}</ref> There is some contention as to the nature of Dowle's departure. Coverdale has maintained that Dowle's lacking performance on the album and unwillingness to "take constructive criticism" led to his firing.<ref name="Ready"/><ref name="LouderLovehunter"/> Bernie Marsden, meanwhile, asserted that Dowle left because he didn't like being at Clearwell Castle and away from his family.<ref name="LouderLovehunter"/> The idea of Paice re-recording Dowle's drum parts was considered, but ultimately rejected by the band's management due to the alleged cost.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=55}} Paice's addition also spurred speculation from the British music press about Coverdale mounting a Deep Purple reunion, which he denied.<ref name="Ready"/> Coverdale later remarked how Paice joining the band felt like "truly the beginning of Whitesnake", where all the members were "performing at [their] absolute best" and "inspiring the best out of each other".<ref name="Early2"/>

''[[Lovehunter]]'', Whitesnake's second album, was released in October 1979,<ref name="LouderLovehunter"/> and it reached number 29 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/19791010/7502/ | title = Official Albums Chart Top 75: 10 October 1979 – 13 October 1979 | publisher = Official Charts | access-date =20 February 2021 }}</ref> ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' gave the record a positive review,<ref name="Lovehunter"/> while AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia was more mixed, commending many of the songs, but criticizing the band's studio performance as "strangely tame".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/lovehunter-mw0000193567 |title=Whitesnake – Lovehunter review |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |work=AllMusic |publisher=All Media Network |access-date=10 February 2021 }}</ref> The album's cover art, depicting a naked woman straddling a giant serpent, caused some controversy when the record was released. Whitesnake had already received criticism from the British music press for their alleged sexist lyrics. The cover art for ''Lovehunter'', done by artist [[Chris Achilleos]], was reportedly commissioned to "just piss [the critics] off even more".<ref name="Lovehunter"/><ref name="Early2"/> In North America, a sticker was placed on the cover to hide the woman's buttocks, while in Argentina the cover art was modified so that the woman wore a chain-mail bikini.<ref name="LouderLovehunter"/> Nevertheless, Whitesnake began a supporting tour for ''Lovehunter'' on 11 October 1979 in the UK, followed by dates in Europe.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=58}}

Later that year, they supported [[AC/DC]] in Europe.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=73}} With the benefit of a hit single, Whitesnake's audience in the UK began to grow.<ref name="Early2"/> Thus, the band recorded and released the double live album ''[[Live... in the Heart of the City]]''. The record combined new material recorded in June 1980 at the Hammersmith Odeon with the previously released ''Live at Hammersmith'' album.<ref name="Live"/> ''Live... in the Heart of the City'' proved to be an even bigger success than ''Ready an' Willing'', reaching number five in the UK.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/19801102/7502/ | title = Official Albums Chart Top 75: 02 November 1980 – 08 November 1980 | publisher = Official Charts | access-date =20 February 2021 }}</ref> It would later go [[Music recording certification|platinum]], with sales of over 300,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bpi.co.uk/award/3922-540-2 | title = Whitenake – Live In The Heart Of The City | access-date = 9 February 2021 | publisher = British Phonographic Industry}}</ref> In North America, the album was released as a single record version, excluding the live material from 1978.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=75}}

=== ''Come an' Get It'' and ''Saints & Sinners'' (1981–1982) ===
In early 1981, Whitesnake began recording their fourth studio album with producer Martin Birch at [[Ringo Starr]]'s [[Startling Studios]] in Ascot, Berkshire. After the success of ''Ready an' Willing'' and ''Live... in the Heart of the City'', Whitesnake were riding high with the atmosphere in the studio being described by Coverdale as "great" and "positive". The resulting record, ''[[Come an' Get It]]'', was released on 6 April 1981.<ref name="Come">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Come an' Get It |title-link=Come an' Get It |others=Whitesnake |date=2007 |first=Geoff |last=Barton |author-link=Geoff Barton |pages=4{{ndash}}11 |type=booklet |publisher=EMI |id=0946 3 81958 2 5}}</ref> Charting in seven countries, it gave the group their highest ever UK chart position at number two.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/19810412/7502/ | title = Official Albums Chart Top 75: 12 April 1981 – 18 April 1981 | publisher = Official Charts | access-date =20 February 2021 }}</ref> That same year, the album was certified gold.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bpi.co.uk/award/1456-540-2 | title = Whitenake – Come And Get It | access-date = 9 February 2021 | publisher = British Phonographic Industry}}</ref> The single "[[Don't Break My Heart Again]]" also charted at number seventeen in the UK.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19810503/7501/ | title = Official Singles Chart Top 75: 03 May 1981 – 09 May 1981 | publisher = Official Charts | access-date =20 February 2021 }}</ref> ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' magazine gave the album a positive review, which proclaimed: "[Whitesnake] has made its claim to rock history with ''Come an' Get It'', which even stands ahead of classic hard rock in the [[Free (band)|Free]] mold."<ref>{{cite magazine |date=31 August 1981 |title=Iron Maiden – Killers (Harvest) & Whitesnake – Come an' Get It (Mirage) |magazine=[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]] |publisher=Circus Enterprises Corporation |location=New York City, New York, United States}}</ref> Coverdale later named the record his favorite album of the band's early years, stating: "Even though we had some great songs on each album, I don't feel that we came as close as we did on [''Come an' Get It''], as far as consistency is concerned."<ref name="Come"/>

Whitesnake kicked off the supporting tour for ''Come an' Get It'' on 14 April 1981 in Germany.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=86}} During the tour, the band performed five nights at the Hammersmith Odeon and eight dates in Japan.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=86}}<ref>{{cite magazine |date=September 1981 |title= Year of the Snake |magazine=[[Kerrang!]] |issue=3 |pages=10{{ndash}}11 |first=Robbi |last=Millar | publisher=United Newspapers | location=London, England}}</ref> They also played the US in July, supporting [[Judas Priest]] with [[Iron Maiden]].{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=86}} At the 1981 [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at Castle Donington, Whitesnake were direct support for headliners AC/DC.<ref name="Come"/> The supporting tour for ''Come an' Get It'' lasted approximately five months.<ref name="Saints">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Saints & Sinners |title-link=Saints & Sinners (Whitesnake album) |others=Whitesnake |date=2007 |first=Geoff |last=Barton |author-link=Geoff Barton |pages=4{{ndash}}11 |type=booklet |publisher=EMI |id=0946 381961 2 9}}</ref>

In late 1981, Coverdale retreated to a small villa in southern Portugal to begin writing the band's next album. After returning to England, he and the rest of Whitesnake gathered at Nomis Studios in London to begin rehearsals. However, as Coverdale would later explain: "There wasn't that 'spark' that was usually in attendance. It felt more of an effort to be there."<ref name="Saints"/> Micky Moody later stated that by the end of 1981, the band had become tired, partially from "too many late nights, too much partying".<ref name="Last Hurrah">{{cite magazine |last=Myhre |first=Stig |year=1997 |title= Whitesnake: The Last Hurrah |url=http://www.whitesnake.f9.co.uk/Moody.html |magazine=Hard Roxx |issue=34 | location=London, England |access-date= 10 February 2021}}</ref> In an effort to lift their collective spirits, Whitesnake returned to [[Clearwell Castle]] in Gloucestershire, where they had recorded ''Lovehunter''. Though morale still remained low, the band were able to record the basic tracks for their next album. Guy Bidmead replaced producer Martin Birch, who was reportedly too ill to work at the time (Birch did eventually return when recording moved to [[Britannia Row Studios|Britannia Row]]).<ref name="Saints"/> This exacerbated the band's ever worsening mental state.<ref name="Charmer">{{cite magazine |date=2{{ndash}}15 December 1982 |title= Snake Charmer |magazine=[[Kerrang!]] |issue=30 |pages=22{{ndash}}27, 37 |first=Dante |last=Bonutto | publisher=United Newspapers | location=London, England}}</ref>

To make matters worse, the band were experiencing financial troubles with Moody recalling: "We weren't making nowhere near the kind of money we should have been making. Whitesnake always seemed to be in debt, and I thought 'What is this?, we're playing in some of the biggest places and we're still being told we're in debt, where is all the money going?'."<ref name="Last Hurrah"/> Eventually, Moody became fed up with the situation and left Whitesnake in December 1981.<ref name="Last Hurrah"/> The remaining band members blamed the group's management company Seabreeze, headed by Deep Purple's former manager [[John Coletta]], for their financial state.<ref name="Mars"/><ref name="Vain"/><ref name="Marsden">{{Cite web| url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/bernie-marsden-what-happened-the-day-i-left-whitesnake | title= Bernie Marsden: What happened the day I left Whitesnake |first=Bernie |last=Marsden |website=Louder |publisher=Classic Rock | date=21 November 2019 | access-date=10 February 2021 }}</ref> According to Bernie Marsden, the band set up a meeting to fire Coletta, but Coverdale failed to show. Instead, Marsden, Neil Murray and Ian Paice were informed that Whitesnake had been put on hold and that they had been fired.<ref name="Marsden"/> Marsden later remarked that "David [Coverdale] decided he would be king of Whitesnake".<ref name="Vain"/>

According to Coverdale, his decision to put the band on hold stemmed from his daughter contracting bacterial meningitis.<ref name="Saints"/><ref name="Q&A">{{cite magazine |last=Chirazi |first=Steffan |date=25 March 2011 |title=The Growing Pains Of Whitesnake's David Coverdale |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/whitesnake-jimmy-page-and-i-walked-through-manhattan-and-stopped-traffic |website=Louder |publisher=Classic Rock |access-date=15 February 2021}}</ref> This purportedly gave him the courage to cut ties with Coletta.

After waiting for his daughter to recuperate and severing ties with the band's management, record companies and publishers, Coverdale began putting Whitesnake back together.

Save for two tracks ("[[Crying in the Rain (Whitesnake song)|Crying in the Rain]]" and "[[Here I Go Again]]"), he characterised the rest of the record as generally mediocre.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=2{{ndash}}15 December 1982 |title= Whitesnake – 'Saints And Sinners' (Liberty LBG 30354) |magazine=[[Kerrang!]] |issue=30 |pages=14 |first=Chas |last=de Whalley | publisher=United Newspapers | location=London, England}}</ref> Conversely, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia, in a retrospective review, hailed ''Saints & Sinners'' as Whitesnake's "best album yet".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/saints-sinners-mw0000197526 |title=Whitesnake – Saints & Sinners review |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |work=AllMusic |publisher=All Media Network |access-date=10 February 2021 }}</ref>

By the time ''Saints & Sinners'' was released, Coverdale had signed a new recording contract with American label [[Geffen Records]], who would handle all future Whitesnake releases in North America. In Europe, the band remained with [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] (a subsidiary of EMI), while in Japan, they signed with [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony]].{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=104}}<ref>{{cite magazine |date=4{{ndash}}17 November 1982 |title= Mayhem! – Over a gargantuan tumbler of cognac a more than, uh, merry David Coverdale revealed that he has just signed a deal with the legendary Geffen Records... |magazine=[[Kerrang!]] |issue=28 |pages=10 | publisher=United Newspapers | location=London, England}}</ref> A&R executive [[John Kalodner]], who had been a long-time fan of Coverdale's, convinced [[David Geffen]] to sign the group.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=104}} Meeting Geffen and Kalodner had a major impact on Coverdale and his future vision for Whitesnake. He explained: "I'd been surrounded by a mentality if you make five pounds profit let's go to the pub. Whereas David Geffen said to me 'If you can make five dollars profit, why not 50? If 50, why not 500? Why not 50,000, why not five million?'" Coverdale soon set his sights on breaking through in North America with Kalodner advising him.<ref name="Q&A"/>{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=105}} Meanwhile, Whitesnake began a supporting for ''Saints & Sinners'' on 10 December 1982 in the UK.<ref name="Charmer"/><ref>{{cite magazine |date=18 November {{ndash}} 2 December 1982 |title= Hatchet Job! |first=Luke |last=Crampton |magazine=[[Kerrang!]] |issue=29 |pages=34 | publisher=United Newspapers | location=London, England}}</ref>

In August 1983, Whitesnake headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, England. The show was filmed and later released as the band's first long-form video, titled ''Whitesnake Commandos''. The band also premiered the new single "[[Guilty of Love (Whitesnake song)|Guilty of Love]]", which was released to coincide with the festival. The entire album had originally been slated for release three weeks prior to the Donington show, but failed to meet the deadline. The band were having problems adapting to Eddie Kramer's style of producing, particularly his method of mixing the record. Eventually things came to a head and Kramer was let go. Coverdale then rehired Martin Birch to complete the album.<ref name="SlideItIn"/> A new release date for the record was set for mid-November with a supporting tour scheduled to start in December.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=6{{ndash}}19 October 1983 |title= Mayhem! – Whitesnake head out on the road for another British tour during December... |magazine=[[Kerrang!]] |issue=52 |page=2 | publisher=United Newspapers | location=London, England}}</ref>

As Whitesnake finished up a European tour in October 1983, Micky Moody left the group. He later attributed his departure to a growing dissatisfaction working in the band, particularly with Coverdale: "Me and David weren't friends and co-writers anymore.

Coverdale and Sykes retreated to the South of France in early 1985 to begin writing the band's next album.

David Coverdale's original vision for Whitesnake was to create a [[blues]]-based, melodic [[hard rock]] band.<ref name="Vain"/> He wanted to combine elements of hard rock, [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and blues with "good commercial [[Hook (music)|hooks]]".{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=34}} Coverdale's earliest influences included [[The Pretty Things]] and [[The Yardbirds]], who combined blues and [[soul music|soul]] with electrified rock, a style Coverdale found more appealing to traditional twelve-bar blues structures. Another major influence on Whitesnake's sound was [[The Allman Brothers Band]], particularly their [[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|first album]].<ref name="Q&A"/> Whitesnake's other early influences included [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]], the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[Fleetwood Mac]] with [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], [[Jeff Beck]] (particularly the albums ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' and ''[[Beck-Ola]]''), [[Paul Butterfield]], and [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]] (particularly ''[[Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton|The Beano Album]]'').<ref name="Vain"/>

As the band began playing and writing together, their sound developed further into what has been described by music critics as their [[blues rock]] period, which encompasses roughly the first five Whitesnake studio albums.<ref name="Vain"/>{{sfn|Popoff|2015|pp=55, 110}} ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s Richard Bienstock described their early sound as "bloozy, sexed-up [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub-rock]]".<ref name="50Greatest"/> Dave Ling, writing for ''Classic Rock'', described "Walking in the Shadow of the Blues" as "a textbook fusion of blues, hard rock and melody".<ref name="LouderLovehunter"/> Micky Moody and Neil Murray have felt that Whitesnake didn't truly find their sound until ''Ready an' Willing''.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|pp=25, 32}} Coverdale has seconded this, stating that ''Ready an' Willing'' was the beginning of what Whitesnake should have sounded like from the start.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=64}}

Beginning with ''Slide It In'', Whitesnake's sound developed more into straightforward hard rock.<ref name="Vain"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/whitesnake-mn0000251595/biography |title=Whitesnake – Biography |last=Monger |first=James Christopher |work=AllMusic |publisher=All Media Network |access-date=10 February 2021 }}</ref> Neil Murray acknowledged that by 1983 the band's sound had become "repetitive" and "stale".<ref name="RockMilestones">{{cite AV media | date=8 January 2008 | title=Rock Milestones: Whitesnake – Slide It In | type=Documentary | publisher=Edgehill Publishing Ltd}}</ref> Coverdale later expressed his desire for the band's blues elements to "rock more".<ref name="Vain"/> Additionally, Murray attributed this shift partially to John Kalodner, who began pushing Whitesnake in a heavier, more guitar-based, "American-sounding" direction.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=143}} John Sykes also played a pivotal role in Whitesnake's evolution,<ref name="RockCandy"/><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Suter |first=Paul |date=19 April 1989 |title= Fatal Attraction |magazine=[[Raw (music magazine)|Raw]] |issue=17 |pages=50{{ndash}}53 |publisher=EMAP Publishing Limited | location=London, England}}</ref> with Murray remarking how Sykes wanted the band to be more "American style".{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=114}} Regardless, music journalist Jerry Ewing described the change as a "natural progression" from the band's previous albums.<ref name="RockMilestones"/>

The band's eponymous album saw Whitesnake moving towards a sound Coverdale described as "leaner, meaner and more electrifying".<ref name="Story"/> This later period of Whitesnake's career has been described by music critics as hard rock,{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=120}} [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]],{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=125}} and [[glam metal]].{{sfn|Popoff|2015|p=171}} Coverdale would later admit that by the late 1980s, Whitesnake had become a "heavy metal comic", stating: "If people confuse Whitesnake with [[Mötley Crüe]] or any of these things, looking at the pictures [...] you can understand why."<ref name="BBCSpecial">{{cite episode |title=Heavy Metal |series=Top Ten |network=BBC |season=1 |number=3 |date=6 March 1999 |last=Jupitus |first=Phill (presenter)}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|It is unclear from the statement whether Coverdale is referring to the magazine ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' or the style of music, when describing Whitesnake becoming a "heavy metal comic".}} Musically though, Coverdale has rejected the notion that Whitesnake were ever a heavy metal band.<ref>{{Cite web | url= https://noisecreep.com/david-coverdale-rejects-heavy-metal-tag-for-whitesnake/ | title=David Coverdale Says Whitesnake Were Never a Heavy Metal Band | website=Noisecreep | date=6 April 2011 | access-date=12 February 2021 }}</ref>

Since reforming the band in 2003, Coverdale has attempted to combine elements of Whitesnake's early sound with their later hard rock style on their most recent studio albums.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=McIver |first=Joel |date=March 2011 |title=Good To Be Bad (SPV/Steamhammer) |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] presents: Whitesnake – Forevermore (The Official Album Magazine) |page=129 |publisher=Future plc |location=London, England}}</ref> However, music critics have noted that Whitesnake's style has remained most consistent with their late 1980s output, with Philip Wilding of ''Classic Rock'' in his review for ''Flesh & Blood'' stating: "Those hoping that the new Whitesnake album record will recall Coverdale's smoky, ''Lovehunter'' past should look away now. [...] Coverdale understood American radio in the 80s, and that might be why he still writes for it."<ref name="Flesh"/>

Coverdale denied any notion of plagiarism, stating: "I don't know how accurate the comparison is. People shouldn't forget that I worked in Deep Purple for a number of years, so my pedigree in hard rock is quite strong. I understand that bands like Whitesnake, Purple and Led Zeppelin all play a solid powerful brand of rock, but I don't think we're coming from the same place musically."{{sfn|Popoff|2015|pp=141{{ndash}}142}} Neil Murray laid some of the blame on John Kalodner, who he claimed began pushing Whitesnake in a more Led Zeppelin-like direction.{{sfn|Popoff|2015|pp=136, 141}} As for the comparisons to Plant, Coverdale said they are "both from a similar school of influences and inspirations and singers [...] I can tell you precisely who Robert listened to to develop the voice he has, which is [[Steve Marriott|Stevie Marriott]] and [[Terry Reid]] and that screaming blues voice isn't copyrighted by Robert and that's something that I've grown up doing too".<ref name="RNZ2020"/>

Whitesnake and main lyricist Coverdale have been heavily criticised by the music press for their excessive use of [[double entendre]]s and [[sexual innuendo]]s, most egregiously on tracks such as "Slide It In", "Slow an' Easy" and "Spit It Out".<ref name="Sexcess"/><ref name="Englishman">{{cite magazine |last=Dome |first=Malcolm |author-link=Malcolm Dome |date=17 August {{ndash}} 4 September 1990 |title= An Englishman Abroad |magazine=[[Raw (music magazine)|Raw]] |issue=52 |pages=18{{ndash}}21 |publisher=EMAP Publishing Limited | location=London, England}}</ref> Such criticism began in the late 1970s and was further inflamed with the ''[[Lovehunter]]'' (1979) [[List of controversial album art|cover art]].<ref name="ClassicRock23">{{cite magazine |last=Ling |first=Dave |date=29 October 2023 |title="We are bathing in innuendo": Whitesnake's Lovehunter artwork was knee-jerk response to their critics, but the album itself was a game-changer |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/whitesnake-lovehunter |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |access-date=17 November 2023}}</ref> Micky Moody, Bernie Marsden and Jon Lord have expressed some discomfort over the band's lyrical content.<ref name="BBCSpecial"/> Coverdale has reiterated that some of his lyrics are meant to provoke laughter more than anything else, stating: "If I look at sex as an observer [...] there's humour also as well as the serious nitty-gritty stuff and I like to write about this as well." He also added that many of his songs are [[tongue-in-cheek]] and inspired by his own experiences, not uncommon to other people as well.<ref>{{cite interview |last1=Coverdale |first1=David |subject-link1=David Coverdale |interviewer=Anders Tengner |title=An Interview with David Coverdale |work=Metaljournalen |year=1984 |publisher=Sveriges Television }}</ref> The lyrics along with his stage personality "solidified an image of Coverdale: the [[preening]], tight-trousered [[lothario]]", according to ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Michael Hann, who also noted that although often ridiculed by the media, by 2015 "there's a certain affection for his magnificently preposterous persona".<ref name="TheG15">{{Cite news|last=Hann|first=Michael|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/22/david-coverdale-whitesnake-the-purple-album-deep-purple|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=David Coverdale: 'I amplify who I am 10 times when I'm on stage'|date=22 April 2015|access-date=13 November 2023}}</ref>
