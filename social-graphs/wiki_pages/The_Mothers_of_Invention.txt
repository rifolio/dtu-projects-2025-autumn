'''The Mothers of Invention''' (also known as '''the Mothers''') was an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[California]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dailybulletin.com/2015/05/08/frank-zappas-mothers-of-invention-formed-50-years-ago-in-pomona/amp/&ved=2ahUKEwie0-PAwaX2AhWKmmoFHY8LBpkQFnoECAQQBQ&usg=AOvVaw3MG1SIcQp6rH3cjN8KPujv |url-status=deviated |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221205064520/https://www.dailybulletin.com/2015/05/08/frank-zappas-mothers-of-invention-formed-50-years-ago-in-pomona/amp/ |archive-date=December 5, 2022 |title=Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention Formed 50 Years Ago in Pomona |website=The Daily Bulletin |access-date=March 2, 2022}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Formed in 1964, their work is marked by the use of sonic experimentation, innovative [[album art]], and elaborate live shows. Originally an [[R&B]] band called '''the Soul Giants''', the band's first lineup comprised [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]], David Coronado, Ray Hunt, [[Roy Estrada]], and [[Jimmy Carl Black]]. [[Frank Zappa]] was asked to take over as the guitarist when a fight between Collins and Hunt led to the latter's being fired. Zappa insisted they perform his original material—a decision that resulted in Coronado's leaving because he did not agree to the change—and on [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]] in 1965 the band changed its name to the Mothers. Record executives demanded the name be changed again, and so, "out of necessity", Zappa later said, "We became the Mothers of Invention", referring to the proverb "[[Necessity is the mother of invention]]".

After early struggles, the Mothers enjoyed substantial popular commercial success. The band first became popular playing in California's underground music scene in the late 1960s. With Zappa at the helm, it was signed to jazz label [[Verve Records]] as part of the label's diversification plans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-mothers-of-invention-mn0000405522/biography|title=The Mothers of Invention {{!}} Biography & History |website=AllMusic|access-date=August 8, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808195916/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-mothers-of-invention-mn0000405522/biography|archive-date=August 8, 2017}}</ref> Verve released the Mothers of Invention's début double album ''[[Freak Out!]]'' in 1966, recorded by Zappa, Collins, Black, Estrada and [[Elliot Ingber]]. During its original run, the band's ever-changing lineup also included [[Don Preston]], [[Bunk Gardner]], [[Billy Mundi]], [[Jim Fielder]], [[Ian Underwood]], [[Jim Sherwood|Jim "Motorhead" Sherwood]], [[Art Tripp]], [[Buzz Gardner]], and [[Lowell George]]. The Mothers released a series of critically acclaimed albums, including ''[[Absolutely Free]]'', ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', and ''[[Uncle Meat]]'', before being disbanded by Zappa in 1969. In 1970, he formed a new version of the Mothers that included Ian Underwood, [[Jeff Simmons (musician)|Jeff Simmons]], [[George Duke]], [[Aynsley Dunbar]] and singers [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]] (formerly of [[the Turtles]], but who for contractual reasons were credited in this band as [[Flo & Eddie|the Phlorescent Leech & Eddie or Flo & Eddie]] for short). Later replacing Simmons with another ex-Turtle, bassist [[Jim Pons]], this second incarnation of the Mothers endured through December 1971, when Zappa was seriously injured and almost killed by an audience member during a concert appearance in London.<ref>{{cite book |title=Real Frank Zappa Book |author1=Frank Zappa |author2=Peter Occhiogrosso |edition=reprinted |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-671-70572-5 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FB0O_HCpBy0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=FB0O_HCpBy0C&pg=PA114 Extract of page 114]</ref>

Zappa focused on big-band and orchestral music while recovering from his injuries, and in 1973 formed the Mothers' final lineup, which included Ian Underwood, George Duke, Ralph Humphrey, Sal Marquez, [[Bruce Fowler]], [[Tom Fowler (musician)|Tom Fowler]], and [[Ruth Underwood]]. [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] and [[Chester Thompson]] also joined the band later that year. The final non-archival album using the Mothers (of Invention) name, ''[[Bongo Fury]]'' (1975), featured [[Captain Beefheart]], as well as guitarist Denny Walley and drummer [[Terry Bozzio]], both of whom continued to play for Zappa on subsequent non-Mothers releases.

==History==
===Early years (1964–1965)===
The Soul Giants were formed in 1964. In early 1965, [[Frank Zappa]] was approached by [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]] who asked him to take over as the guitarist following a fight between Collins and the group's original guitarist.{{sfn |Bashe |George-Warren |Pareles |1995 |p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2020}} Zappa accepted, and convinced the other members that they should play his music to increase the chances of getting a record contract.{{sfn |Zappa |Occhiogrosso |1989 |pp=65–66}} Original leader David Coronado did not think that the band would be employable if they played original material, and left the band.{{sfn |Zappa |Occhiogrosso |1989 |pp=65–66}} Zappa soon assumed leadership and the role as co-lead singer, even though he never considered himself a singer.<ref name="HighTimes1980">{{cite magazine| last = Swenson| first = John | title = Frank Zappa: America's Weirdest Rock Star Comes Clean | date = March 1980 |magazine=High Times}}</ref>

The band was renamed the Mothers, coincidentally on [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]].{{sfn |Slaven |2009 |p=42}} The group increased their bookings after beginning an association with manager [[Herb Cohen]], while they gradually gained attention on the burgeoning [[Los Angeles]] [[underground music]] scene.{{sfn |Walley |1980 |p=58}} In early 1966, they were spotted by leading record producer, [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], when playing Zappa's "[[Trouble Every Day (song)|Trouble Every Day]]", a song about the [[Watts Riots]].{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=103}}<ref name=pc34>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19793/m1/ |title=Show 34 – Revolt of the Fat Angel: American musicians respond to the British invaders. [Part 2]}}</ref> Wilson had earned acclaim as the producer for singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]] and the folk-rock act [[Simon & Garfunkel]], and was notable as one of the few African Americans working as a major label pop music producer at this time.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Emergence of Rock and Roll: Music and the Rise of American Youth Culture |first1=Mitchell K. |last1=Hall |publisher=Routledge |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-135-05357-4 |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWeLAwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QWeLAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT86 Extract of page 86]</ref>

Wilson signed the Mothers to the [[Verve Records]] division of [[MGM Records]], which had built up a strong reputation in the [[music industry]] for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences. Verve insisted that the band officially rename themselves because "Mother" in slang terminology was short for "[[motherfucker]]"—a term that apart from its profanity, in a jazz context connotes a very skilled musical instrumentalist.<ref>
{{cite episode | people = Nigel Leigh | title = Interview with Frank Zappa | series = The Late Show | network=BBC2 | location = [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen]], Los Angeles, California |date=March 1993}}</ref> The label suggested the name "The Mothers Auxiliary", which prompted Zappa to come up with the name "The Mothers of Invention".

===Debut album: ''Freak Out!'' (1966)===
{{Main|Freak Out!}}
{{Listen|filename=Zappa_HungryFreaks.ogg|description=The opening track on ''Freak Out!'' The album has "consistently been voted as one of top 100 greatest albums ever made".{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=115}}<br />&nbsp;|title="Hungry Freaks Daddy"}}
With Wilson credited as producer, the Mothers of Invention, augmented by a studio orchestra, recorded the groundbreaking ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966) which, preceded by Bob Dylan's ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'', was the second rock double album of new material ever released. It mixed R&B, [[doo-wop]], musique concrète,{{sfn |Lowe |2006 |p=25}} and experimental [[sound collage]]s that captured the "freak" subculture [[Arts and culture of Los Angeles|of Los Angeles]] at that time.{{sfn |Walley |1980 |pp=60–61}} Although he was dissatisfied with the final product—in a late 1960s radio interview (included in the posthumous ''[[The MOFO Project/Object|MOFO Project/Object]]'' compilation) Zappa recounted that the side-long closing track "Return of the Son of Monster Magnet" was intended to be the basic track for a much more complex work which Verve did not allow him to complete—''Freak Out'' immediately established Zappa as a radical new voice in rock music, providing an antidote to the "relentless consumer culture of America".{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=115}} The sound was raw, but the [[arrangement]]s were sophisticated. While recording in the studio, some of the additional [[session musician]]s were shocked that they were expected to read the notes on sheet music from [[Chord chart|charts]] with Zappa conducting them, since it was not standard when recording rock music.{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=112}} The lyrics praised non-conformity, disparaged authorities, and had [[dada]]ist elements. Yet, there was a place for seemingly conventional love songs.{{sfn |Watson |2005 |pp=10–11}} Most compositions are Zappa's, which set a precedent for the rest of his recording career. He had full control over the arrangements and musical decisions and did most [[Overdubbing|overdubs]]. Wilson provided the industry clout and connections to get the group the financial resources needed.{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=123}}

===Absolutely Free===
{{Main|Absolutely Free}}
Wilson nominally produced the Mothers' second album ''[[Absolutely Free]]'' (1967), which was recorded in November 1966, and later [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in New York, although by this time Zappa was in ''de facto'' control of most facets of the production. It featured extended playing by the Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined Zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements.{{sfn |Lowe |2006 |p=5}} Examples are "Plastic People" and "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, but also of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfn |Lowe |2006 |pp=38–43}} As Zappa put it, "[W]e're satirists, and we are out to satirize everything."{{sfn |Miles |2004 |pp=135–138}}

===New York period (1966–1968)===
{{See also|We're Only in It for the Money|Cruising with Ruben & the Jets}}
The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the [[Garrick Cinema|Garrick Theater]] during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year.<ref>James, 2000, ''Necessity Is&nbsp;... '', pp. 62–69.</ref> As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York.{{sfn |Miles |2004 |pp=140–141}} Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa's famous hand signals.{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=147.}} Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a "[[gook]] baby".{{sfn |Zappa |Occhiogrosso |1989 |p=94}}

Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'' (released 1968).<ref>{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r22631|pure_url=yes}} | title = We're Only in It for the Money. Review | last= Huey| first = Steve | website=AllMusic |access-date=January 2, 2008}}</ref> It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. ''We're Only in It for the Money'' featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the [[hippie]] and [[flower power]] phenomena.{{sfn |Watson |2005 |p=15}}{{sfn |Walley |1980 |p=90}} The cover photo parodied that of [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'',<ref name="MoneyCover">As the legal aspects of using the Sgt Pepper concept were unsettled, the album was released with the cover and back on the inside of the gatefold, while the actual cover and back were a picture of the group in a pose parodying the inside of the Beatles album. {{harvnb |Miles |2004 |p=151}}</ref> its art provided by [[Cal Schenkel]] whom Zappa had met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.{{sfn |Watson |1995 |p=88}}

Reflecting Zappa's eclectic approach to music, the next album, ''[[Cruising with Ruben & the Jets]]'' (1968), was very different. It represented a collection of [[doo-wop]] songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute.{{sfn |Lowe |2006 |p=58}} Zappa has noted that the album was conceived in the way Stravinsky's compositions were in his neo-classical period: "If he could take the forms and clichés of the classical era and pervert them, why not do the same&nbsp;... to doo-wop in the fifties?"{{sfn |Zappa |Occhiogrosso |1989 |p=88}} A theme from Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' is heard during one song. The album and a single consisting of the songs "Deseri" and "Jelly Roll Gum Drop" were released under the alias '''[[Ruben and the Jets]]'''.<ref name=Eder/><ref>Frank Zappa, "Serious Fan Mail", ''Greasy Love Songs'', Zappa Records ZR20010, 2010.</ref>

===Return to Los Angeles and break up (1968–1969)===
{{See also|Uncle Meat|Burnt Weeny Sandwich|Weasels Ripped My Flesh}}
Zappa and the Mothers of Invention returned to Los Angeles in the summer of 1968. Despite being a success with fans in Europe, the Mothers of Invention were not faring well financially.{{sfn |Walley |1980 |p=116}} Their first records were vocally oriented, but Zappa wrote more instrumental jazz and classical oriented music for the band's concerts, which confused audiences. Zappa felt that audiences failed to appreciate his "electrical chamber music".{{sfn |Slaven |2009 |pp=119–120}}{{sfn |Miles |2004 |pp=185–187}} Recorded from September 1967 to September 1968 and released in early 1969, ''[[Uncle Meat]]'', the final release by the original Mothers, was a double album of varied music, intended as a soundtrack for a proposed film of the same name.

In November 1968, after Collins had left for the final time, Zappa recruited future [[Little Feat]] guitarist [[Lowell George]] to replace him.

In 1969, there were nine band members and Zappa was supporting the group himself from his publishing [[royalties]], whether they played or not.{{sfn |Walley |1980 |p=116}} 1969 was also the year Zappa, fed up with the label's interference, left MGM Records for Warner Bros.' [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] subsidiary, where Zappa/Mothers recordings would bear the Bizarre Records imprint.

In late 1969, Zappa broke up the band. He often cited the financial strain as the main reason,{{sfn |Zappa |Occhiogrosso |1989 |p=107}} but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort.{{sfn |Slaven |2009 |p=120}} Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some took it as a sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling.{{sfn |Miles |2004 |pp=185–187}} Others were irritated by "his [[Autocracy|autocratic]] ways",{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=123}} exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members.{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=116}} Several members would, however, play for Zappa in years to come. Zappa began recruiting new band members at this time, even asking [[Micky Dolenz]] from [[The Monkees]] to join. Zappa had appeared on the series and in the movie ''Head''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://somethingelsereviews.com/2014/08/27/oh-my-god-talk-about-a-redirection-micky-dolenz-on-his-most-interesting-post-monkees-job-offer/|title='Oh, my God – talk about a redirection': Micky Dolenz on his most interesting post-Monkees job offer |website=Something Else!|date=August 27, 2014|access-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513133420/http://somethingelsereviews.com/2014/08/27/oh-my-god-talk-about-a-redirection-micky-dolenz-on-his-most-interesting-post-monkees-job-offer/|archive-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref>{{sfn |Miles |2004 |pp=158–159}} Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on ''[[Burnt Weeny Sandwich]]'' and ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]'' (both released in 1970).

George and Estrada formed [[Little Feat]] with [[Richie Hayward]] and [[Bill Payne]] after the Mothers disbanded.

===Rebirth of the Mothers and filmmaking (1970)===
{{See also|Fillmore East – June 1971|Just Another Band from L.A.}}
[[File:Mark-Volman.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Volman]] performing with the Mothers in 1971.]]
Later in 1970, Zappa formed a new version of the Mothers (from then on, he mostly dropped the "of Invention"). It included British drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]], jazz keyboardist [[George Duke]], [[Ian Underwood]], [[Jeff Simmons (musician)|Jeff Simmons]] (bass, rhythm guitar), and three members of [[the Turtles]]: bass player [[Jim Pons]], and singers [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]], who, due to persistent legal and contractual problems, adopted the stage name "The Phlorescent Leech and Eddie", or "[[Flo & Eddie]]".{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=201}}

This version of the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album ''[[Chunga's Revenge]]'' (1970),{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=205}} which was followed by the [[200 Motels (soundtrack)|double-album soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[200 Motels]]'' (1971), featuring the Mothers, the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Theodore Bikel]], and [[Keith Moon]]. Co-directed by Zappa and [[Tony Palmer (director)|Tony Palmer]], it was filmed in a week at [[Pinewood Studios]] outside London.{{sfn |Watson |1995 |p=183}} Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting.{{sfn |Watson |1995 |p=183}} The film deals loosely with life on the road as a rock musician.{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=207}} It was the first feature film photographed on [[videotape]] and transferred to [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]], a process which allowed for novel visual effects.{{sfn |Starks |1982 |p=153}} It was released to mixed reviews.{{sfn |Lowe |2006 |p=94}} The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.{{sfn |Zappa |Occhiogrosso |1989 |pp=119–137}}

After ''200 Motels'', the band went on tour, which resulted in two live albums, ''[[Fillmore East – June 1971]]'' and ''[[Just Another Band from L.A.]]''; the latter included the 20-minute track "[[Billy the Mountain]]", Zappa's satire on rock opera set in Southern California. This track was representative of the band's theatrical performances in which songs were used to build up sketches based on ''200 Motels'' scenes as well as new situations often portraying the band members' sexual encounters on the road.{{sfn |Miles |2004 |pp=203–204}}<ref>During the June 1971 Fillmore concerts Zappa was joined on stage by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]. This performance was recorded, and Lennon released excerpts on his album ''[[Some Time in New York City]]'' in 1972. Zappa later released his version of excerpts from the concert on ''[[Playground Psychotics]]'' in 1992, including the jam track "Scumbag" and an extended avant-garde vocal piece by Ono (originally called "Au"), which Zappa renamed "A Small Eternity with Yoko Ono".</ref>

===Accident, attack and their aftermath (1971–1972)===
{{See also|The Grand Wazoo}}
[[File:Frank Zappa Mothers of Invention 1971.JPG|thumb|The Mothers of Invention in 1971]]
In December 1971, there were two serious setbacks. While performing at [[Montreux Casino|Casino de Montreux]] in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino.{{sfn |Zappa |Occhiogrosso |1989 |pp=112–115}} Immortalized in [[Deep Purple]]'s song "[[Smoke on the Water]]", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album ''Swiss Cheese/Fire!'', released legally as part of Zappa's ''[[Beat the Boots II]]'' compilation. After a week's break, the Mothers played at the [[Rainbow (London)|Rainbow Theatre]], London, with rented gear. During the encore, an audience member pushed Zappa off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit. The band thought Zappa had been killed—he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed [[larynx]], which ultimately caused his voice to drop a [[Major third|third]] after healing.{{sfn |Zappa |Occhiogrosso |1989 |pp=112–115}} This accident resulted in him using a wheelchair for an extended period, forcing him off the road for over half a year. Upon his return to the stage in September 1972, he was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed "shorter than the other" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs "Zomby Woof" and "Dancin' Fool"), resulting in chronic back pain.{{sfn |Zappa |Occhiogrosso |1989 |pp=112–115}} Meanwhile, the Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.

After releasing a solo jazz-oriented album ''[[Waka/Jawaka]]'', and following it up with a Mothers album, ''[[The Grand Wazoo]]'', with large bands, Zappa formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included [[Ian Underwood]] (reeds, keyboards), [[Ruth Underwood]] (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] (sax, flute and vocals), [[Bruce Fowler]] (trombone), [[Tom Fowler (musician)|Tom Fowler]] (bass), [[Chester Thompson]] (drums), [[Ralph Humphrey (drummer)|Ralph Humphrey]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Ralph_Humphrey.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406202738/http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Ralph_Humphrey.html | archive-date=April 6, 2013 | title=Ralph Humphrey - DRUMMERWORLD }}</ref> (drums), [[George Duke]] (keyboards, vocals), and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] (violin).

Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album ''[[Apostrophe (album)|Apostrophe (')]]'' (1974), which reached a career-high No.&nbsp;10 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] pop album charts<ref>{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p74796|pure_url=yes}} | title= Frank Zappa > Charts and Awards > Billboard Albums | website=AllMusic |access-date=January 3, 2008}}</ref> helped by the chart single "[[Don't Eat the Yellow Snow]]".<ref>{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r53148|pure_url=yes}} | title= Apostrophe ('). Review | last= Huey| first = Steve | website=AllMusic |access-date=January 3, 2008}}</ref> Other albums from the period are ''[[Over-Nite Sensation]]'' (1973), which contained several future concert favorites, such as "Dinah-Moe Humm" and "[[Montana (Frank Zappa song)|Montana]]", and the albums ''[[Roxy & Elsewhere]]'' (1974) and ''[[One Size Fits All (Frank Zappa album)|One Size Fits All]]'' (1975) which feature ever-changing versions of a band still called the Mothers, and are notable for the tight renditions of highly difficult [[jazz fusion]] songs in such pieces as "[[Inca Roads]]", "Echidna's Arf (Of You)" and "Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)".{{sfn |Lowe |2006 |pp=114–122}} A live recording from 1974, ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2]]'' (1988), captures "the full spirit and excellence of the 1973–75 band".{{sfn |Lowe |2006 |pp=114–122}}

Zappa released ''[[Bongo Fury]]'' in 1975, which featured live recordings from a tour that same year which had reunited him with [[Captain Beefheart]] for a brief period.{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=248}} They later became estranged for a period of years, but were in contact at the end of Zappa's life.{{sfn |Miles |2004 |p=372}} ''Bongo Fury'' was the last new album to be credited to the Mothers.

In 1993, Zappa released ''[[Ahead of Their Time]]'', an album of a 1968 live performance by the original Mothers of Invention lineup.
