'''The Cure''' are<!-- This article is written in British English, in which band names take the plural verb form; do not change "are" to "is". See WP:ENGVAR. --> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Crawley]] in 1976 by [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] (vocals, guitar) and [[Lol Tolhurst]] (drums). The band's current line-up comprises Smith, [[Simon Gallup]] (bass), [[Roger O'Donnell]] (keyboards), [[Perry Bamonte]] (guitar and keyboards), [[Jason Cooper]] (drums) and [[Reeves Gabrels]] (guitar). Smith has remained the only constant member throughout numerous line-up changes since the band's formation, though Gallup has been present for all but two of the band's studio albums.

The Cure's debut album ''[[Three Imaginary Boys]]'' (1979), along with several early singles, placed the band at the forefront of the emerging [[post-punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] movements that were gaining prominence in the United Kingdom. The band adopted a new, increasingly dark and tormented style beginning with their second album ''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'' (1980), which had a strong influence on the emerging genre of [[gothic rock]]. After the release of their fourth album ''[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]'' (1982), Smith started to introduce more [[Pop music|pop]] into the band's music, leading them to worldwide mainstream success. The band reached their commercial peak with the albums ''[[Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me]]'' (1987), ''[[Disintegration (The Cure album)|Disintegration]]'' (1989) and ''[[Wish (The Cure album)|Wish]]'' (1992) recorded with guitarist [[Porl Thompson]] and drummer [[Boris Williams]].

The Cure have released 14 studio albums, two EPs, and over 40 singles, selling more than 30 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Cure {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/20492/cure |access-date=20 February 2021 |website=[[Official Charts Company]]}}</ref> They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2019. Their 14th album ''[[Songs of a Lost World]]'' (2024) was their first release of all-new material in 16 years and received widespread acclaim, topping the charts in multiple countries (including the UK, their first number one album in the country since 1992) and becoming one of the year's fastest selling albums.

==History==
===1973–1979: Formation and early years===
The founding members of the Cure were school friends at Notre Dame Middle School in [[Crawley]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=R857BwAAQBAJ&pg=PA60|page= 60|title= Rock Band Name Origins| first= Greg | last= Metzer|publisher= McFarland |date= 21 May 2008|isbn= 9780786455317}}</ref> They first performed in public at an end-of-year show in April 1973 as members of a one-off school band called Obelisk.<ref name=Obelisk>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6O0Pv8aG44C&pg=PT48|page= 26|title= Never Enough: The Story of The Cure|author= Jeff Apter|publisher= Omnibus Press |date= 5 November 2009|isbn= 9780857120243}}</ref> That band consisted of Robert Smith on piano, [[Michael Dempsey]] on guitar, [[Lol Tolhurst]] on percussion, Marc Ceccagno on lead guitar, and Alan Hill on bass.<ref name=Obelisk/> In January 1976, while at [[St Wilfrid's Catholic School, Crawley|St Wilfrid's Comprehensive School]], Ceccagno formed a five-piece rock band with Smith on guitar and Dempsey on bass, along with two other school friends.<ref name=TIY>{{cite book |title= Ten Imaginary Years |first1= L. |last1= Barbarian |first2= Steve |last2= Sutherland |authorlink3= Robert Smith (musician) |first3= Robert |last3=Smith| year= 1988| publisher= Zomba Books | isbn=0-946391-87-4}}</ref> They called themselves Malice and rehearsed [[David Bowie]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Alex Harvey]] songs in a local church hall.<ref name= Spiral>{{cite magazine| title= The Cure, A History| magazine= Spiral Scratch Magazine| first= Rachel| last= Doran | date= April 1992| publisher=}}</ref> By late April 1976, Ceccagno and the other two members had left, and Tolhurst (drums), Martin Creasy (vocals), and [[Porl Thompson]] (guitar) had joined the band.<ref name= TIY3>Barbarian, Sutherland, Smith (1988)</ref> This lineup played all three of Malice's only documented live shows during December 1976. In January 1977, following Creasy's departure, and increasingly influenced by the emergence of [[punk rock]], Malice's remaining members became known as Easy Cure – after a song written by Tolhurst.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p= 36}}

After winning a talent competition, Easy Cure signed a [[recording contract]] with German record label [[Ariola Records|Ariola]]-[[Hansa Records|Hansa]] on 18 May 1977.<ref name="TIY" /> In September 1977, Peter O'Toole (no relation to [[Peter O'Toole|the actor]]), who had been the group's vocalist for several months, left the group to live on a [[kibbutz]] in Israel. The band auditioned several vocalists that month before Smith assumed the role.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=46}} The new four-piece of Dempsey, Smith, Thompson, and Tolhurst recorded their first studio demo sessions as Easy Cure for Hansa at SAV Studios in London in October and November 1977.<ref name=sutherland>''A History of The Cure'' in ''Melody Maker Magazine'' by Steve Sutherland (1990)</ref> None were ever released.<ref name="Frost">{{cite journal |last= Frost |first= Deborah |date= 1 October 1987 |title= Taking The Cure with Robert |journal= [[Creem]]}}</ref>

The band continued to perform regularly around Crawley (including the Rocket, St Edward's, and Queen's Square in particular) throughout 1977 and 1978. On 19 February 1978 they were joined at the Rocket for the first time by a support band from [[Horley]] called Lockjaw, featuring bassist [[Simon Gallup]].<ref name="shows">Barbarian, Sutherland, Smith (1988); and ''The Cure: A Visual Documentary'', by Dave Thompson and Jo-Ann Greene (1988) Omnibus Press {{ISBN|0-7119-1387-0}}</ref> Hansa, dissatisfied with the group's demos, did not wish to release their original song "[[Killing an Arab]]". The label suggested that the band attempt cover versions instead. They refused, and by March 1978 Easy Cure's contract with the label had been dissolved.<ref name=sutherland2>Sutherland (1990) and Barbarian, Sutherland, Smith (1988)</ref> Smith later recalled, "We were very young. They just thought they could turn us into a teen group. They actually wanted us to do cover versions and we always refused."<ref name="Frost"/>

On 22 April 1978, Easy Cure played their last gig at the Montefiore Institute Hall (in the [[Three Bridges, West Sussex|Three Bridges]] neighbourhood of Crawley)<ref name=shows2>''Anomolie'', Sureaud, Michaux, Ramage (1990–'92)</ref> before guitarist Porl Thompson was dropped from the lineup because his lead-guitar style was at odds with Smith's growing preference for [[minimalist]] songwriting.<ref name=sutherland3>Sutherland (1990)</ref> Smith soon renamed the remaining trio the Cure.{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp= 56–57}} Later that month the band recorded their first sessions as a trio at Chestnut Studios in Sussex, producing a demo tape for distribution to a dozen major record labels.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=62}} The demo found its way to [[Polydor Records]] scout [[Chris Parry (producer)|Chris Parry]], who signed the Cure to his newly formed [[Fiction Records|Fiction]] label – distributed by Polydor – in September 1978.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p= 68}} The Cure released their debut single "Killing an Arab" in December 1978 on the [[Small Wonder Records|Small Wonder]] label as a stopgap until Fiction finalised distribution arrangements with Polydor. "Killing an Arab" garnered both acclaim and controversy. While the single's provocative title led to accusations of racism, the song is based on French author [[Albert Camus]]'s novel [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|''The Stranger'']].<ref>{{cite journal |last= Hull |first= Robot A. |date= January 1982 |title= The Cure: ...Happily Ever After |journal= [[Creem]]}}</ref> The band placed stickers that denied the racist connotations on the single's 1979 reissue on Fiction. An early ''[[NME]]'' article on the band wrote that the Cure "are like a breath of fresh suburban air on the capital's smog-ridden pub-and-club circuit," and noted: "With a [[John Peel]] session and more extensive London gigging on their immediate agenda, it remains to be seen whether the Cure can retain their refreshing [[joie de vivre]]."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Thrills |first= Adrian |date= 16 December 1978 |title= Ain't No Blues for the Summertime Cure |journal= [[NME]]}}</ref>

The Cure released their debut album ''[[Three Imaginary Boys]]'' in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer [[Mike Hedges]] took control of the recording.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=84}} The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted: "a lot of it was very superficial – I didn't even like it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it."<ref name="Spin 1987">{{cite journal |last= Sweeting |first= Adam |date= July 1987 |title= The Cure – Curiouser and Curiouser |journal= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] }}</ref> The band's second single, [[Boys Don't Cry (The Cure song)|"Boys Don't Cry"]], was released in June. [[File:Siouxsie and the Banshees-3.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Steven Severin]], [[Siouxsie Sioux]] and [[Budgie (musician)|Budgie]] with whom Robert Smith played inside [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] as guitarist, in 1979, then from 1982 to 1984]] The Cure then embarked as the support band for [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]' ''[[Join Hands]]'' promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double-duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when [[John McKay (guitarist)|John McKay]] quit the group in Aberdeen.{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp= 105}} That musical experience had a strong impact on him: "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the [[Buzzcocks]] or [[Elvis Costello]]; the punk [[The Beatles|Beatles]]. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing."<ref>{{cite book |last= Paytress |first= Mark |year= 2003 |title= Siouxsie & the Banshees: The Authorised Biography |publisher= Sanctuary Publishing |page= 96}}</ref>

The Cure's third single, "[[Jumping Someone Else's Train]]", was released in October 1979. Soon afterwards, Dempsey was dropped from the band because of his cold reception to material Smith had written for the upcoming album.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=106}} Dempsey joined [[The Associates (band)|the Associates]], while Simon Gallup (bass) and [[Matthieu Hartley]] (keyboards) from [[The Magazine Spies|the Magspies]] joined the Cure. The Associates toured as support band for the Cure and [[The Passions (British band)|the Passions]] on the ''Future Pastimes Tour'' of England between November and December – all three bands were on the Fiction Records roster – with the new Cure line-up already performing a number of new songs for the projected second album.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=112}} Meanwhile, a spin-off band comprising Smith, Tolhurst, Dempsey, Gallup, Hartley, and Thompson, with backing vocals from assorted family and friends and lead vocals provided by their local postman Frankie Bell, released a [[gramophone record|7-inch]] single in December under the name [[I'm a Cult Hero|Cult Hero]].{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp=100–101}}

Due to the band's lack of creative control on their first album, Smith exerted a greater influence on the recording of their second album ''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'', which he co-produced with Mike Hedges.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=114}} The album was released in 1980 and reached number 20 on the [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]]. A single from the album, "[[A Forest]]", became the band's first UK hit single, reaching number 31 on the singles chart.<ref name="Guinness">{{cite book |editor-last=Roberts |editor-first=David |year=2006 |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |edition=19th |publisher=HIT Entertainment |page=130 |isbn=1-904994-10-5}}</ref> The album was a departure from the Cure's sound up to that point, with Hedges describing it as "morose, atmospheric, very different to ''Three Imaginary Boys''."{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=117}} In its review of ''Seventeen Seconds'' the ''NME'' said, "For a group as young as the Cure, it seems amazing that they have covered so much territory in such a brief time."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kent |first=Nick |date=26 April 1980 |title=Why Science Can't Find Cure for Vagueness |journal=[[NME]]}}</ref> At the same time, Smith became concerned about the concept of an alleged "anti-image".<ref>{{cite news |last=Gosse |first=Van |date=21 April 1980 |title=The Cure Play It Pure |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]}}</ref> Smith told the press he was fed up with the anti-image association that some considered to be "elaborately disguising their plainness", stating, "We had to get away from that anti-image thing, which we didn't even create in the first place. And it seemed like we were trying to be more obscure. We just didn't like the standard rock thing. The whole thing really got out of hand."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Morley |first=Paul |author-link=Paul Morley |date=12 July 1980 |title=Days of Wine and Poses |journal=[[NME]]}}</ref> That same year ''Three Imaginary Boys'' was repackaged for the American market as ''[[Boys Don't Cry (The Cure album)|Boys Don't Cry]]'', with new artwork and a modified track list. The Cure set out on their first world tour to promote both releases. At the end of the tour, Matthieu Hartley left the band. Hartley said, "I realised that the group was heading towards suicidal, sombre music – the sort of thing that didn't interest me at all."{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=126}}

The band reconvened with Hedges to produce their third album, ''[[Faith (The Cure album)|Faith]]'' (1981), which furthered the dour mood present on ''Seventeen Seconds''.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=132}} The album peaked at number 14 on the UK charts.<ref name="Guinness"/> Included with cassette copies of ''Faith'' was an instrumental soundtrack for ''[[Carnage Visors]]'', an animated film shown in place of an opening act for the band's 1981 Picture Tour.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=136}} In late 1981 the Cure released the non-album single "[[Charlotte Sometimes (song)|Charlotte Sometimes]]". By this point, the sombre mood of the music had a profound effect on the attitude of the band and they were "stuck in a ghoulish rut". Sometimes Smith would be so absorbed by the persona he projected onstage that he would leave at the end in tears.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=141}}

In 1982 the Cure recorded and released ''[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]'', the third and final album of an "oppressively dispirited" trio that cemented the Cure's stature as one of the purveyors of the emerging [[gothic rock]] genre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Reynolds |year=2005 |title=[[Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984]] |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/ripitupstartagai00reyno/page/358 358] |isbn=0-14-303672-6 }}</ref> Smith has said that during the recording of ''Pornography'' he was "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But it had nothing to do with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about ''Pornography''. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time".<ref name="Spin 1987"/> Gallup described the album by saying, "[[Nihilism]] took over ... We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time."{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=161}} Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer [[Phil Thornalley]] to polish the track "[[The Hanging Garden (song)|The Hanging Garden]]" for release as a single.{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp=158–59}} Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, ''Pornography'' became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight.<ref name="Guinness"/>

The release of ''Pornography'' was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, in which the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their [[trademark look|signature look]] of big, towering hair, and smeared lipstick on their faces.{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp=166–67}} Simon Gallup left the Cure at the tour's conclusion after a bar fight with Smith; the two did not talk to each other for the following eighteen months.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=171}} Smith then placed the Cure on hold and rejoined [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] as their lead guitarist in November 1982.<ref>{{cite web |title=Siouxsie And The Banshees: "We were losing our minds" |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/siouxsie-and-the-banshees-we-were-losing-our-minds-2572 |website=Uncut |access-date=18 September 2019 |date=24 October 2014}}</ref> He subsequently became a full-time member of that band, and was featured on the live video and album ''[[Nocturne (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Nocturne]]''. He then recorded the album ''[[Hyæna]]'' with them, but left the group two weeks before its June 1984 release to concentrate on the Cure.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Savage |first1=Jon |title= Siouxsie and the Banshees: Our 1986 Interview |url= https://www.spin.com/featured/siouxsie-and-the-banshees-siouxsie-sioux-tinderbox-june-1986-interview-high-priestess/ |website=Spin |access-date=18 September 2019 |date=26 July 2019}}</ref>

With Gallup's departure from the Cure and Smith's work with Siouxsie and the Banshees, rumours spread that the Cure had broken up. In December 1982, Smith remarked to ''[[Melody Maker]]'', "Do the Cure really exist any more? I've been pondering that question myself ... it has got to a point where I don't fancy working in that format again." He added, "Whatever happens, it won't be me, Laurence and Simon together any more. I know that."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sutherland |first=Steve |date=18 December 1982 |title=The Incurables |journal=[[Melody Maker]]}}</ref>

Parry was concerned about the state of his label's top band, and became convinced that the solution was for the Cure to reinvent its musical style. Parry managed to convince Smith and Tolhurst of the idea; Parry said, "It appealed to Robert because he wanted to destroy the Cure anyway."{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=174}} With Tolhurst now playing keyboards instead of drums, the duo released the single "[[Let's Go to Bed (The Cure song)|Let's Go to Bed]]" in late 1982. While Smith wrote the single as a throwaway, "stupid" pop song to the press,{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=176}} it became a minor hit in the UK, reaching number 44 on the singles chart,<ref name="Guinness"/> and entered the Top 20 in Australia and New Zealand. It was followed in 1983 by two more successful songs: the synthesiser-based "[[The Walk (The Cure song)|The Walk]]" which reached number 12, and "[[The Love Cats (song)|The Love Cats]]", which became the band's first British Top 10 hit, reaching number seven.<ref name="Guinness"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/love%20cats/ |title=The Love Cats – The Cure |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=29 October 1983 |access-date=27 August 2018 }}</ref> These singles and their B-sides were compiled on the ''[[Japanese Whispers]]'' compilation, which was released in December 1983.<ref>{{cite web |last1=True |first1=Chris |title=Japanese Whispers – The Cure {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/japanese-whispers-mw0000198005 |website=AllMusic |access-date=18 September 2019 |language=en-us}}</ref>

[[File:Robert-smith-cure-miyako-np.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Smith in 1985]]
In 1984, the Cure released ''[[The Top (album)|The Top]]'', a generally psychedelic album on which Smith played most of the instruments except drums (played by [[Andy Anderson (drummer)|Andy Anderson]]) and saxophone (played by early Malice member Porl Thompson, who then officially joined the Cure). The album was a Top 10 hit in the UK, and was their first studio album to crack the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US, reaching number 180.<ref name= "Guinness"/><ref name="Billboard charts">{{cite magazine |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the cure|chart=all}} |title=The Cure – Chart History <nowiki>|</nowiki> ''Billboard'' |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date= 26 June 2013}}</ref> ''Melody Maker'' praised the album as "psychedelia that can't be dated", while pondering, "I've yet to meet anyone who can tell me why the Cure are having hits now of all times."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sutherland |first=Steve |date=5 May 1984 |title=Topsy-Turvy [''The Top'' – review] |journal=[[Melody Maker]]}}</ref> The Cure then embarked on their worldwide [[The Cure The Top Tour|Top Tour]] with Thompson and Anderson, along with Phil Thornalley who had produced ''The Top'' and assumed bass duties for live performances. Released in late 1984, the Cure's first live album, ''[[Concert (album)|Concert]]'', consisted of performances from this tour. Near the tour's end, Anderson was fired for destructive behaviour, and was temporarily replaced for a few shows by Vince Ely of [[the Psychedelic Furs]]. The drummer position was then officially filled by [[Boris Williams]], who had previously been the touring drummer for [[Thompson Twins]].{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=205}} Ely and Williams had both been recommended by Phil Thornalley, from his previous experiences as a producer and engineer.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |last=Price |first=Simon |title=Curepedia: An A-Z of The Cure |publisher=[[William Morrow and Company|William Morrow]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-06-306864-3 |location=New York, NY |publication-date=2023 |pages=359–362}}</ref> Soon thereafter, Thornalley also left because of the stress of touring.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=207}} Former Cure bassist Simon Gallup, who had formed the band [[Fools Dance]] in the interim, rejoined the Cure after roadie Gary Biddles brokered a reconciliation between Gallup and Smith.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=208}} Smith was ecstatic about Gallup's return and declared to ''Melody Maker'', "It's a group again."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sutherland |first=Steve |date=17 August 1985 |title=A Suitable Case for Treatment |journal=[[Melody Maker]]}}</ref>

In 1985, the new line-up of Smith, Tolhurst, Gallup, Williams, and Thompson (now on guitar and keyboards) released ''[[The Head on the Door]]'', an album that managed to bind together the optimistic and pessimistic aspects of the band's music between which they had previously shifted.{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp=209–10}} ''The Head on the Door'' reached number seven in the UK and number 59 in the US,<ref name="Guinness"/><ref name="Billboard charts"/> a success partly due to the international impact of the album's two singles, "[[In Between Days]]" and "[[Close to Me (The Cure song)|Close to Me]]". Following the album and world tour, the band released the singles compilation ''[[Standing on a Beach]]'' in three formats (each with a different track listing and a specific title) in 1986, accompanied by a [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] ''Staring at the Sea'', which featured videos for each track on the compilation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pareles |first1=Jon |title=RECORDINGS; The Cure Provides Company for Misery |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/21/arts/recordings-the-cure-provides-company-for-misery.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=18 October 2022 |date=21 May 1989}}</ref> This compilation made the US top 50,<ref name="Billboard charts"/> and saw the re-issue of three previous singles: "Boys Don't Cry" (in a new form), "Let's Go to Bed" and, later, "Charlotte Sometimes". The Cure toured to support the compilation and released a live concert VHS and LaserDisc of the show, filmed in the south of France and called ''[[The Cure in Orange]]''. During this time, the band became very popular in Europe (particularly in France, Germany, and the [[Benelux]] countries) and increasingly popular in both the US and Canada.{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp=12–13}}

In May, the Cure released the eclectic double album ''[[Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me]]'', which reached number six in the UK, the top 10 in several countries,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=The+Cure&titel=Kiss+Me+Kiss+Me+Kiss+Me&cat=a |title= The Cure – ''Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me'' |website=dutchcharts.nl |access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref> and was the band's first entry into the US top 40 at number 35; the album was also certified platinum in the US.<ref name="Guinness"/><ref name= "Billboard charts"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title= Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – June 25, 2013 |website=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref> The album's third single, "[[Just Like Heaven (The Cure song)|Just Like Heaven]]", was the band's most successful single to date in the US, being their first to enter the ''Billboard'' [[Top 40]].<ref name="Billboard charts"/> The album produced three other hit singles. After the album's release, the band recruited [[Roger O'Donnell]], previously the touring keyboardist for [[the Psychedelic Furs]] and a longtime friend of Williams, to supplement the work of Tolhurst while allowing Thompson to focus on guitar. During the subsequent tour, Tolhurst's alcohol consumption began to interfere with his ability to perform.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=229}}

In 1989, the Cure returned to a darker form of music with the album ''[[Disintegration (The Cure album)|Disintegration]]'',{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=234}} which was critically praised and became their highest-charting album to date, entering at number three in the UK and featuring three Top 30 singles in the UK and Germany: "[[Lullaby (The Cure song)|Lullaby]]", "[[Lovesong (The Cure song)|Lovesong]]" and "[[Pictures of You (The Cure song)|Pictures of You]]".<ref name= "Guinness"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/CURE%2CTHE/single |title=Die ganze musik im internet: Charts, neuersheinungen, Tickets, Genres, genresuche, genrelexion, kunstler-sache, musik-suche, track-suche, ticket-suche |website= Musicline.de |access-date=26 June 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090402103955/http://musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/CURE%2CTHE/single |archive-date=2 April 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''Disintegration'' also reached number 12 on the US charts.<ref name= "Billboard charts"/> The first single in the US, "[[Fascination Street]]", was heavily played on American radio stations and reached number one on the Modern Rock chart, but was quickly overshadowed by its third US single, "Lovesong", which reached number two on the American [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart (the only Cure single to reach the US Top 10).<ref name="Billboard charts"/> By 1992, ''Disintegration'' had sold over three million copies worldwide.<ref name="mansion"/>

During the ''Disintegration'' sessions, the band gave Smith an ultimatum that either Tolhurst would have to leave the band or they would.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=238}} In February 1989, Tolhurst's exit was made official and announced to the press;{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=240}} this resulted in O'Donnell becoming a full-fledged member of the band and left Smith as the Cure's only remaining founding member. Smith attributed Tolhurst's dismissal to an inability to exert himself and issues with alcohol, concluding, "He was out of step with everything. It had just become detrimental to everything we'd do."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=James |date=8 April 1989 |title=Ten Years in Lipstick and Powder |journal= NME}}</ref> Because Tolhurst was still on the payroll during the recording of ''Disintegration'', he is credited in the album's liner notes as playing "other instruments" and is listed as a co-writer of every song; however, it has since been revealed that while Tolhurst had contributed to the song "Homesick",<ref name= "Pennyblack8447">{{cite web| url= http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article/8447/Interviews/Lol-Tolhurst--Interview| title= Lol Tolhurst – Interview| website= pennyblackmusic.co.uk| access-date= 5 December 2018| archive-date= 26 September 2019| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190926180929/http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article/8447/Interviews/Lol-Tolhurst--Interview| url-status= dead}}</ref> his contributions to the rest of the album were minimal due to his alcoholism.<ref name="Pennyblack8447" />

The Cure then embarked on a successful tour which saw the band playing stadiums in the US.

''[[Wild Mood Swings]]'', finally released in 1996, was poorly received compared with previous albums and marked the end of the band's commercial peak.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=275}} Early in 1996, the Cure played festivals in South America, followed by a world tour in support of the album. In 1997 the band released ''[[Galore (The Cure album)|Galore]]'', a compilation album containing all of their singles released between 1987 and 1997, as well as the new single "[[Wrong Number (The Cure song)|Wrong Number]]", which featured longtime [[David Bowie]] guitarist [[Reeves Gabrels]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Reeves Gabrels Joins The Cure |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/article/13043417/reeves-gabrels-joins-the-cure |website=Nashville Scene |date=30 May 2012 |access-date=14 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref> In 1998 the Cure contributed the song "More Than This" to the [[The X-Files: The Album|soundtrack]] for ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'' film, as well as a cover of "[[World in My Eyes]]" for the [[Depeche Mode]] tribute album ''[[For the Masses]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I_511Ub29s | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211116/3I_511Ub29s| archive-date=16 November 2021 | url-status=live|title= The Cure – EPK for The Masses Depeche Tribute (Robert Smith 1998) |publisher= YouTube |date= 10 May 2017 |access-date= 10 May 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===1999–2005: The Trilogy and more personnel changes===
With only one album left in their record contract and with commercial response to ''Wild Mood Swings'' and the ''Galore'' compilation lacklustre, Smith once again considered that the end of the Cure might be near and thus wanted to make an album that reflected the more serious side of the band.{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp=281, 284}} The [[Grammy]]-nominated album ''[[Bloodflowers]]'' was released in 2000 after being delayed since 1998.{{sfn|Apter|2006|p=284}} According to Smith, the album was the third of a trilogy along with ''Pornography'' and ''Disintegration''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/may/30/homeentertainment.features |title=Home Entertainment: Robert Smith <nowiki>| Music |</nowiki> ''The Guardian'' |last=Hodgkinson |first=Will |date=30 May 2003 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=26 June 2013}}</ref> The band embarked on the nine-month Dream Tour, which included 20 dates in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cure Announce World Tour For Bloodflowers |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/719930/cure-announce-world-tour-for-bloodflowers/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806002512/http://www.mtv.com/news/719930/cure-announce-world-tour-for-bloodflowers/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 August 2015 |website=MTV News |access-date=14 December 2019 |language=en}}</ref> In 2001, the Cure left Fiction and released their ''[[Greatest Hits (Cure compilation)|Greatest Hits]]'' album and DVD, which featured the music videos for a number of their songs.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Cure Bolsters 'Hits' With New Songs, Acoustic Disc |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78293/cure-bolsters-hits-with-new-songs-acoustic-disc |magazine=Billboard |access-date=14 December 2019}}</ref> The band released ''[[The Cure: Trilogy]]'' as a double [[live album]] video, on two double layer [[DVD-9]] discs, and later on a single [[Blu-ray]] disc.

The Cure are often identified with the [[gothic rock]] genre, and are viewed as one of the form's definitive bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/00620-the-cure-selecting-the-best-for-one-side-of-a-c90 |title= The Cure: Selecting the Best for One Side of a C90 |last=Doran |first=John |date=27 October 2008 |website=[[The Quietus]]|access-date=20 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/pornography-mw0000199022 |title=''Pornography'' – The Cure : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Mason |first=Stewart |website=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[AllRovi]] |access-date=20 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3672066/The-Cure-Godfather-of-goth-relishes-his-power.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3672066/The-Cure-Godfather-of-goth-relishes-his-power.html |archive-date=10 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=The Cure: Godfather of Goth Relishes His Power – ''Telegraph'' |last=McNulty |first=Bernadette |date=24 March 2008 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=26 June 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref> However, the band has routinely rejected classification, particularly as a gothic rock band.

==Music videos==
The band's early music videos have been described as "dreadful affairs" and have been maligned for their poor quality, particularly by the band itself. Tolhurst said, "Those videos were unmitigated disasters; we weren't actors and our personalities weren't coming across."{{sfn|Apter|2006|pp=177–78}} The video for "Let's Go to Bed" was their first collaboration with [[Tim Pope]]. The director added a playful element to the band's videos; the director insisted in a 1987 ''Spin'' interview, "I think that side of them was always there, but was never brought out."<ref name="Spin 1987"/>

Pope would go on to direct the majority of the Cure's videos, which became synonymous with the band, and expanded their audience during the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/staring-at-the-sea-the-images-mr0001432912 |title=''Staring at the Sea: The Images'' – : Release Information, Reviews and Credits : AllMusic |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[AllRovi]] |access-date=20 February 2013}}</ref> Pope explained the appeal of working with the Cure by saying, "the Cure is the ultimate band for a filmmaker to work with because Robert Smith really understands the camera.
