'''Queens of the Stone Age''' (commonly abbreviated as '''QOTSA''' or '''QotSA''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Seattle]] in 1996. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist [[Josh Homme]] shortly before he returned to his native [[Palm Desert, California]]. Homme has been the only constant member throughout multiple line-up changes; since 2013, the line-up has consisted of Homme, [[Troy Van Leeuwen]] (guitar, [[Lap steel guitar|lap steel]], keyboards, percussion, backing vocals), [[Michael Shuman]] (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), [[Dean Fertita]] (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals), and [[Jon Theodore]] (drums, percussion).

Formed after the dissolution of Homme's previous band [[Kyuss]], the band originated from the spread of the [[Palm Desert Scene|Palm Desert music scene]]. Its [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|self-titled debut album]] (1998) was recorded with Homme singing and playing all instruments except drums, which were provided by former Kyuss member [[Alfredo Hernández]]. Bassist [[Nick Oliveri]] joined the band for its accompanying tour and soon became co-lead vocalist alongside Homme. The band's second studio album, [[Rated R (Queens of the Stone Age album)|''Rated R'']] (2000), featured [[Mark Lanegan]] as a guest vocalist and was the band's major label debut with [[Interscope Records]]. It was critically and commercially successful, and featured the breakout single "[[The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret]]". The band's third studio album, ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]'' (2002), featured [[Dave Grohl]] on drums alongside contributions from [[Alain Johannes]] and [[Natasha Shneider]].

After Oliveri's and Lanegan's respective departures in 2004 and 2005, Homme once again became the band's sole lead vocalist; Van Leeuwen and drummer [[Joey Castillo]] collaborating on ''[[Lullabies to Paralyze]]'' (2005) and [[Era Vulgaris (album)|''Era Vulgaris'']] (2007). After several years of inactivity, the band signed to independent label [[Matador Records]] in 2013 and released a loose trilogy of albums over the next decade: ''[[...Like Clockwork]]'' (2013), [[Villains (Queens of the Stone Age album)|''Villains'']] (2017), and ''[[In Times New Roman...]]'' (2023). The trilogy brought further acclaim and commercial success, with ''...Like Clockwork'' becoming the band's first album to top the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.

The band has been nominated for 9 [[Grammy Awards]]: four for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]], three for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]], and one each for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 23, 2020|title=Queens of the Stone Age|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/queens-stone-age/8455|access-date=February 3, 2021|website=[[Grammy Awards]]|language=en}}</ref> The band also has a large pool of [[List of Queens of the Stone Age contributors|contributors and collaborators]] and is known for incorporating elements of [[blues]], [[electronica]], and [[Krautrock]] into its [[riff]]-oriented and rhythmic [[hard rock]], coupled with Homme's distinct falsetto vocals and unorthodox guitar scales.

The EP featured [[Van Conner]] of Screaming Trees, and drummer [[Victor Indrizzo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefade.net/oldsite/discography/gammaray.html|title=Discography entry for ''Gamma Ray''|website=thefade.net|access-date=May 9, 2007|archive-date=December 3, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241203151158/http://www.thefade.net/oldsite/discography/gammaray.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Gamma Ray changed their name in 1997 after the German [[power metal]] band [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] threatened to sue. The name "Queens of the Stone Age" came from a nickname given to Kyuss by their producer [[Chris Goss]]. Homme said of the name: "Kings would be too macho. The Kings of the Stone Age wear armor and have axes and wrestle. The Queens of the Stone Age hang out with the Kings of the Stone Age's girlfriends when they wrestle ... Rock should be heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls. That way everyone's happy and it's more of a party. Kings of the Stone Age is too lopsided."<ref>"2000 Ozzfest Chat - Nick and Josh from Queens of the Stone Age". ''Ozzfest''. August 16, 2000.

The first release under the Queens of the Stone Age name was the song "18 A.D.," released on [[Roadrunner Records]]' compilation album ''Burn One Up! Music for Stoners.'' It featured guitarist Dave Catching as well as the bassist Milo Beenhakker and drummer Eva Nahon of the Dutch [[stoner rock]] band [[Beaver (band)|Beaver]], owing to connections Homme made while living in [[Amsterdam]] for a few months following Kyuss' breakup.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 26, 2018 |title=DTRH18: De geheime Nederlandse wortels van Queens of the Stone Age |url=https://3voor12.vpro.nl/artikelen/overzicht/2018/Down-the-rabbit-hole-2018/De-Nederlandse-wortels-van-Queens-of-the-Stone-Age.html |access-date=August 21, 2023 |website=3voor12 |language=nl}}</ref> The band's first live appearance was at Seattle's [[OK Hotel]] on November 20, 1997, with Cameron on drums, [[Mike Johnson (bassist)|Mike Johnson]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]] on bass and John McBain of [[Monster Magnet]] on guitar.

Homme returned to [[Palm Desert, California]], where he released Queens of the Stone Age's [[Queens of the Stone Age (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1998 on [[Stone Gossard]]'s and [[Regan Hagar]]'s label [[Loosegroove Records]], and on vinyl by [[Man's Ruin Records]]. Homme played guitar and bass on the album (the latter credited to Homme's alter-ego Carlo Von Sexron), [[Alfredo Hernández]] on drums, and several other contributions by Chris Goss and Hutch. Homme reportedly asked Screaming Trees vocalist [[Mark Lanegan]] to appear on the record, but he was unable due to other commitments.<ref>[http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2008/01/03/mark-lanegan-the-man-comes-around/ Mark Lanegan: The Man Comes Around] – MAGNET Magazine Inc. 2011</ref>

Soon after the recording sessions were finished for the album, former Kyuss bassist [[Nick Oliveri]] joined the group, and touring commenced with a band consisting entirely of ex-Kyuss members. Catching, a former Kyuss guitar tech, joined shortly after. From this point forward, the band's line-up would change frequently; by the time their second album was being recorded, Hernández had left the group to play in other bands.<ref>{{cite web

{{blockquote|There's a robotic element to our albums, like the repetition of riffs. We also wanted to do a record that had a lot of dynamic range.

During the 2001 [[Rock in Rio]] show, bassist Nick Oliveri was arrested after performing on stage naked, with only his bass guitar covering his genitals. Oliveri apologized to officials, saying that he did not know it was a crime in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1438389/nude-queens-stone-age-bassist-arrested-rio.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531011109/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1438389/nude-queens-stone-age-bassist-arrested-rio.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 31, 2013|title=Nude Queens Of The Stone Age Bassist Arrested In Rio|date=June 22, 2001|publisher=MTV.com|author=Moss, Corey}}</ref>

Following his work on ''Rated R'', Lanegan joined the band as a full-time member, a position he held until early 2005. Towards the end of the ''Rated R'' tour, the band's performance at the 2001 [[Rock am Ring]] festival in Germany was, according to Homme, "the worst show we've ever played and it was in front of 40,000 people."<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://www.fhmonline.com/site/content/article.aspx?ID=34373 | title = Album Reviews: Era Vulgaris | magazine = FHM | access-date = December 7, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100107182742/http://fhmonline.com/site/content/article.aspx?ID=34373 | archive-date = January 7, 2010 }}</ref> The band decided to [[tattoo]] themselves with the starting time of the performance, "Freitag 4:15." As Oliveri explained:

{{blockquote|Me, Mark [Lanegan], Josh [Homme] and Hutch, our soundman, have the same tattoo, it's from Rock am Ring festival. The time we had to play was 4:15 in the afternoon and it was just a terrible show. It sucked, it was horrible. That's why I tattooed it on my ribs, where it would hurt, so I'd never forget.|Oliveri, interview with ''Daredevil Magazine'' (2005)}}

[[Dave Grohl]], [[Foo Fighters]] frontman and former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer, joined in late 2001 to record drums for the band's third album, ''[[Songs for the Deaf]].'' It was released in August 2002 and again featured Lanegan. The final track on the album, "Mosquito Song", featured former [[A Perfect Circle]] member [[Paz Lenchantin]] on viola and piano along with [[Dean Ween]] on guitar. Another former A Perfect Circle member, guitarist [[Troy Van Leeuwen]], joined the touring line-up following the album's release.

{{blockquote|This record was supposed to sound bizarre—like lightning in a bottle. We also were extremely fucked up. It even sounds that way to me, like a crazy person.

"No One Knows" and "Go with the Flow" were also featured on the first iterations of the popular video games ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and ''Rock Band'' (respectively). Furthermore, the latter track was featured in the popular video game ''[[Fortnite]]'' as a song in ''Fortnite Festival''. The song "You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire" was featured in the video games, ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground]]'' and ''[[IndyCar Series (video game)|IndyCar Series]]''. It was also used as the theme song in Naughty Dog's "[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]" in 2005 along with "Song for the Dead". The song was also used in the films ''[[XXX (2002 film)|xXx]]'', ''[[Project X (2012 film)|Project X]]'' and ''[[Skincare (film)|Skincare]]''.

<!-- This is not clear, Did Dave Grohl leave in 2004 ? I don't think so -->
The ''Songs for the Deaf'' tour culminated in a string of headline dates in Australia in January 2004. Grohl returned to his other projects and was replaced on the European leg of the tour by former [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] drummer [[Joey Castillo]], who joined the band full-time. After the tour, Homme fired Oliveri, as he was convinced that Oliveri had been physically abusive to his girlfriend: "A couple years ago, I spoke to Nick about a rumor I heard. I said, 'If I ever find out that this is true, I can't know you, man.'"<ref>{{cite magazine| last=Cohen | first=Jonathan | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62176/homme-comes-clean-on-oliveri-firing | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]] | title=Homme Comes Clean On Oliveri Firing | date=July 6, 2005 | access-date=May 9, 2007}}</ref> Homme considered breaking up the band after firing Oliveri, but found a new determination to continue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/queens-of-the-stone-age/52832|title=Josh Homme: 'I considered breaking up Queens after Nick Oliveri left' &#124; News|date=September 2, 2010|publisher=Nme.Com|access-date=May 28, 2014}}</ref> Oliveri countered in the press that the band had been "poisoned by hunger for power" and that without him, they were "Queens Lite."

In late 2004, Homme, along with [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]] multi-instrumentalist [[Alain Johannes]] and remaining band members Van Leeuwen and Castillo recorded the Queens' fourth studio album, ''[[Lullabies to Paralyze]]'', a title taken from a lyric in "Mosquito Song" from their previous album.<ref name="Vertigo">{{cite news | url=http://www.vertigo.fm/main.php?site=artist_texte&artist_id=1639 | publisher=Vertigo | title=Queens of the Stone Age Interview | access-date=May 9, 2007 | archive-date=July 21, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721121411/http://www.vertigo.fm/main.php?site=artist_texte&artist_id=1639 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The album featured guests including [[ZZ Top]]'s [[Billy Gibbons]]. Despite Lanegan reportedly turning down an invitation to remain with the band, he recorded vocals on new tracks (notably the solo vocalist on the opening track "This Lullaby") and appeared on the supporting tour as scheduling and his health permitted.

''Lullabies to Paralyze'' was leaked onto the internet in February 2005 and was aired by Triple J radio in Australia on March 3, 2005, as an unsubstantiated 'World Premiere'. It was then officially released on Tuesday, March 22, 2005, in the US, debuting in the number 5 slot on the [[Billboard Music Chart]], the greatest debut of any Queens record until ''...Like Clockwork'' debuted at number 1 in June 2013.

On May 14, 2005, the group was the [[List of Saturday Night Live hosts and musical guests|musical guest on Saturday Night Live]], hosted by Will Ferrell. One of Ferrell's popular Saturday Night Live characters, fictional [[Blue Öyster Cult]] cowbellist [[More cowbell|Gene Frenkle]], made a re-appearance on the show, playing with the Queens on their first song of the night, "[[Little Sister (Queens of the Stone Age song)|Little Sister]]." Frenkle played the song's wood block part using a cowbell along with the band.

On November 22, 2005, Queens of the Stone Age released a live album/DVD set, ''[[Over the Years and Through the Woods]]'', featuring a live concert filmed in London, England, and bonus features which included rare videos of songs from 1998 to 2005. In 2005, the group supported [[Nine Inch Nails]] on their North American tour of ''[[With Teeth]]'' along with [[Autolux]] (for the first half of the tour) and [[Death from Above 1979]] (for the second). NIN's guitarist [[Aaron North]] appeared as an onstage guest with the Queens for the songs "Born to Hula," "Regular John," "[[Avon (song)|Avon]]," "[[Monsters in the Parasol]]" and "Long, Slow Goodbye" at the [[Wiltern Theatre|Wiltern LG]] in Los Angeles on December 19 and 20, 2005.

The band began a North American Tour in 2007, which they named the "Duluth Tour" because they were going to many small towns and cities they had never played before, such as [[Duluth, Minnesota]].<ref name="Duluth">{{cite web| url =http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_tours/queens_of_the_stone_age_the_duluth_tour_details.html| title =Queens of the Stone Age: The "Duluth Tour" Details| access-date =October 3, 2007| date= June 3, 2007| publisher =[[Ultimate Guitar]]}}</ref> The tour was extended to other areas, such as the United Kingdom, where the band played more shows than on any of their previous UK tours. The band toured in Australia in late March to early April 2008, on the V festival tour, including a string of side shows. Throughout the beginning of May 2008, the band completed the Canadian leg of its touring.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/47386-pumpkins-jamc-qotsa-air-css-rock-aussie-v-fest| title =Pumpkins, JAMC, QOTSA, Air, CSS Rock Aussie V Fest| access-date =June 4, 2008| publisher =[[Pitchfork Media]]| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070724132847/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/47386-pumpkins-jamc-qotsa-air-css-rock-aussie-v-fest| archive-date =July 24, 2007}}</ref>

In November 2007, Queens of the Stone Age performed a semi-acoustic set in an underground salt mine in Germany, performing a selection of hits, rarities, covers and an unreleased song named "Cathedral City."<ref>{{cite news|title=QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE Performs At Former Salt Mine; Teaser Clip Available |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/queens-of-the-stone-age-performs-at-former-salt-mine-teaser-clip-available/|work=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=July 12, 2016}}</ref> A DVD of the concert was planned but aside from a trailer promoting the DVD and a number of photographs, no footage of the concert has been released.

On July 2, 2008, Queens of the Stone Age's former keyboardist Natasha Shneider died of lung cancer at the age of 52. The news broke with a message posted on the MySpace page of the band Sweethead, of which Natasha's close friend and former bandmate Troy Van Leeuwen is a member. The band's homepage was updated with a memorial message by Homme replacing the normal front page. The band performed a concert in celebration of Natasha Shneider's life at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on August 16, 2008.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Appleford |first=Steve |last2= |date=October 8, 2010 |title=Alain Johannes adjusts to the dawn |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-oct-08-la-et-alain-johannes-20101008-story.html |access-date=October 14, 2024 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> They were joined on stage by Shneider's husband Alain Johannes, [[Tenacious D]], [[Matt Cameron]], [[Brody Dalle]], [[Jesse Hughes (musician)|Jesse Hughes]], Chris Goss, and [[PJ Harvey]], playing a variety of QOTSA and non-QOTSA songs, including covers of songs from bands such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[The Doors]]. Tenacious D and Harvey also performed acoustic sets at the show. Proceeds from the concert went to defray the costs associated with Shneider's treatment.{{Citation required|date=October 2024}}

On August 22 and 23, 2008, Queens of the Stone Age performed the last shows of their ''Era Vulgaris'' tour at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] in the UK, and Josh Homme announced in an interview with the BBC and during the show that he would be returning to the studio to work on the next album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading and Leeds Festivals 2008 - Queens of the Stone Age|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/readingandleeds/2008/artists/queensofthestoneage/video2.shtml#emp|publisher=BBC|access-date=December 5, 2015}}</ref>

=== Homme's health issues, debut re-release and promotional tour (2009–2011) ===
During 2009 and 2010, band members worked on side projects during the down time. Troy Van Leeuwen started up a new band, [[Sweethead]]. Joey Castillo played for [[Eagles of Death Metal]] on their ''[[Heart On]]'' tour. Bassist Michael Shuman continued his work as drummer and vocalist with [[Mini Mansions]], while Dean Fertita became the guitarist/keyboardist for [[Jack White]]'s newest group, The Dead Weather. Josh Homme formed [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Them Crooked Vultures]] with [[Dave Grohl]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122919|title=JOSH HOMME, JOHN PAUL JONES, DAVE GROHL Collaborate On New Project|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704214952/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122919|archive-date=July 4, 2009}}</ref> After Them Crooked Vultures finished touring in June, the band toured and released a two-CD deluxe edition of ''Rated R'' on August 3, 2010. This edition featured the original CD along with six B-sides and live recordings from the band's Reading performance in 2000.

In 2010, Homme suffered from complications during a botched knee surgery, during which his heart stopped for a short time due to [[asphyxia]]tion; doctors had to use a [[defibrillator]] to revive him. Following this, he was bedridden for four months and plunged into a deep depression, during which he considered giving up his music career altogether.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/home-sweet-homme-29293913.html|title=Home, sweet Homme - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=July 22, 2017|language=en}}</ref> He elaborated on this experience further in an interview on [[Marc Maron]]'s [[WTF with Marc Maron|WTF podcast]], explaining that he had contracted a [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) infection which his immune system could not fight due to stress. Homme has since said that the experience contributed greatly to the writing and recording of ''...Like Clockwork''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_431_-_josh_homme|title=Episode 431 - Josh Homme|website=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast|date=October 10, 2013 }}</ref>

After Homme recovered, Queens of the Stone Age released a remastered version of their self-titled debut album in early 2011, and performed the album in its entirety in a promotional tour.<ref name="roadrunnerrecords" /> The band performed on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' on April 14,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=156919|title=Queens of the Stone Age performs on ''Conan''|publisher=Roadrunner Records/Blabbermouth|access-date=April 18, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421072513/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=156919|archive-date=April 21, 2011}}</ref> and later played at the Australian music festival [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]].<ref name="official"/> Throughout the summer of 2011, the band appeared at various European festivals, including the [[Glastonbury Festival]], in [[Somerset]], UK. They also played at Pearl Jam's 20th Anniversary Festival at Alpine Valley in East Troy, Wisconsin on September 3 and 4, 2011, which would be their last with drummer Joey Castillo.

Following a performance by QOTSA at the [[Jay Z]]-owned [[Made In America Festival]] in the summer of 2013, Homme made comments about the rap star during a radio interview with CBC Radio 2's ''Strombo Show''. Homme explained that his band was frisked by the event's security team prior to the performance and referred to Jay Z's personal interaction with the band as a marketing stunt. Homme stated:

{{cquote|He has his security frisking the bands on the way in. I just told them if you open up my bag I'm not playing so I guess it's up to you whether we are playing or not ... The idea they frisked all my guys, means you're in some different place, no-one has ever done that [to me] ... He also gave us some champagne and wanted us to take a photo with it. And I thought, "That's not a gift, that is a marketing tool." So I destroyed it. Because I thought it was rude overall. And you shouldn't frisk my guys, you should fuck off.<ref>{{cite web|title=Josh Homme has 99 problems and Jay Z is one|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/36955/Josh-Homme-has-99-problems-and-Jay-Z-is-one|work=Faster Louder|publisher=Faster Louder Pty Ltd|access-date=20 September 2013|author=Sarah Smith|date=17 September 2013|archive-date=September 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920002800/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/36955/Josh-Homme-has-99-problems-and-Jay-Z-is-one|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

Homme has on numerous occasions described the band's music as "rock versions of electronic music", saying he takes inspiration from the repetitive nature of electronic [[trance music]] along with various forms of dance music, [[hip hop]], [[trip hop]] and [[Krautrock]]. He called this heavy rock style mixed with the structure of electronic music "robot rock" in an interview with [[KQSL|KUNO-TV]] at the 2001 [[Roskilde Festival]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Homme has described aspects of his distinctive guitar playing style.<ref>{{Citation|last=Noisey|title=Josh Homme - Guitar Moves - Episode 3|date=May 29, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJDUHq2mJx0| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211028/AJDUHq2mJx0| archive-date=October 28, 2021|access-date=April 19, 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He demonstrated the "Josh Homme scale", which he said was the result of years playing and altering the [[blues scale]].
