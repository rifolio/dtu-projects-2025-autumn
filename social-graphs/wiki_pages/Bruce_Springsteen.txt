'''Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen''' (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist.<!-- Kindly do not put "podcaster" in that list. It violates WP:UNDUE. --> Nicknamed "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#S|the Boss]]", Springsteen has released 21 studio albums spanning six decades; most of his albums feature the [[E Street Band]], his backing band since 1972. Springsteen is a pioneer of [[heartland rock]], combining commercially successful rock with poetic, socially conscious lyrics that reflect [[Working class in the United States|working class American life]]. He is known for his energetic concerts, some of which last more than four hours.

Springsteen released his first two albums, ''[[Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.]]'' and ''[[The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle]]'', in 1973. Although both were well received by critics, neither earned him a large audience. He changed his style and achieved worldwide popularity with ''[[Born to Run]]'' (1975). Springsteen followed with ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'' (1978) and ''[[The River (Bruce Springsteen album)|The River]]'' (1980), Springsteen's first album to top the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. After the solo acoustic album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' (1982), he recorded ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'' (1984) with the E Street Band, which became his most commercially successful album and the [[List of best-selling albums|23rd-best selling album ever]] as of 2024. All seven singles from ''Born in the U.S.A.'' reached the Top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including the [[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|title track]]. Springsteen mostly hired session musicians for the recording of his next three albums, ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]'' (1987), ''[[Human Touch]]'' (1992), and ''[[Lucky Town]]'' (1992). He reassembled the E Street Band for ''[[Greatest Hits (Bruce Springsteen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1995), and recorded the acoustic album ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]'' (1995) and the EP ''[[Blood Brothers (EP)|Blood Brothers]]'' (1996) solo.

Springsteen then released ''[[The Rising (album)|The Rising]]'' (2002), which was dedicated to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]]. He released two more folk albums, ''[[Devils & Dust]]'' (2005) and ''[[We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions]]'' (2006), his first cover album. Springsteen followed with two more albums with the E Street Band, ''[[Magic (Bruce Springsteen album)|Magic]]'' (2007) and ''[[Working on a Dream]]'' (2009). His next albums, ''[[Wrecking Ball (Bruce Springsteen album)|Wrecking Ball]]'' (2012) and ''[[High Hopes (album)|High Hopes]]'' (2014), topped album charts worldwide. In 2017, 2018 and 2021, Springsteen performed the critically acclaimed show ''[[Springsteen on Broadway]]'', in which he performed songs and told stories from [[Born to Run (autobiography)|his 2016 autobiography]]; an [[Springsteen on Broadway (album)|album version]] from the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] performances was released in 2018. He released the solo album ''[[Western Stars]]'' in 2019, ''[[Letter to You]]'' with the E Street Band in 2020, and a solo covers album entitled ''[[Only the Strong Survive (Bruce Springsteen album)|Only the Strong Survive]]'' in 2022. ''Letter to You'' reached No. 2 in the US, making Springsteen the first artist to release a top-five album in six consecutive decades.

A prominent musician from the [[album era]], Springsteen has sold more 140 million records worldwide, making him one of the [[best-selling music artists of all time]]. [[List of awards and nominations received by Bruce Springsteen|His accolades]] include 20 [[Grammy Award]]s, two [[Golden Globe]]s, an [[Academy Award]], and a [[Special Tony Award]]. He was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1999, received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 2009, was named [[MusiCares]] person of the year in 2013, and was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2016 and the [[National Medal of Arts]] in 2023. In 2010, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Springsteen 23rd on its list of the "[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]", describing him as "the embodiment of rock and roll". In 2025, Springsteen became one of only of five artists to gross over $2.3 billion in touring thanks to his [[Springsteen and E Street Band 2023 Tour|2023-2025 Tour]] with the E Street Band.

Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic School in Freehold, where he was at odds with the nuns and rebelled against the strictures imposed upon him, though some of his later music reflected a Catholic ethos and included [[Irish Catholic]] hymns with a rock music twist.<ref name="glorydays">{{Cite book |last=Marsh |first=Dave |title=Glory Days: Bruce Springsteen in the 1980s |year=1987 |pages=88–89}}</ref> In 2012, Springsteen said that it was his Catholic upbringing rather than his political ideology that most influenced his music. He said his faith gave him a "very active spiritual life" but joked that this "made it very difficult sexually" and added "once a Catholic, always a Catholic".<ref name="RS2" /><ref>Editors, "Boss Talk", ''The Tablet,'' February 25, 2012.</ref> He grew up hearing fellow New Jersey singer [[Frank Sinatra]] on the radio, and became interested in being a musician by the age of seven after seeing [[Elvis Presley]]'s performances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1956 and 1957. Soon after, his mother rented him a guitar from Mike Diehl's Music in Freehold for $6 a week and took a few weeks of guitar lessons, but quit after it failed to provide him with the instant gratification he desired.{{sfn|Statham|2013|pp=8–9}}

In ninth grade, Springsteen entered [[Freehold High School]], a public high school, but did not fit in there either. A former teacher said Springsteen was a "loner who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar". He graduated in 1967, but felt so alienated that he skipped his graduation ceremony.<ref name="Springsteen. Robert Hilburn 1985, p. 28"/> He briefly attended [[Ocean County College]], but dropped out.<ref name="glorydays" /> At age 19, Springsteen was [[Conscription in the United States|called for his draft physical]], but failed it because of a [[concussion]] he suffered in a motorcycle accident two years earlier combined with his behavior at induction, both of which reportedly made him unacceptable for [[military service]].

In 1964, Springsteen saw [[the Beatles]]' televised appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Inspired, he bought his first guitar for $18.95 at the [[Western Auto]] appliance store.<ref name="Crandall" />{{sfn|Statham|2013|pp=12–13}} Thereafter, he started playing for audiences with a band called the Rogues at local venues, including [[Elks Lodge]] in Freehold.{{sfn|Carlin|2012|p=26}} Later that year, his mother took out a loan to buy him a $60 [[Kent (guitar)|Kent]] guitar, an act he later memorialized in his song "The Wish". In 1965, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist and subsequently one of the lead singers of [[the Castiles]], a band that recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in [[Brick Township]] and played a variety of venues, including [[Cafe Wha?]] in [[Greenwich Village]].

As Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and lyrical style, he performed with the bands Dr. Zoom & the Sonic Boom from early-to-mid-1971, the Sundance Blues Band in mid-1971, and the Bruce Springsteen Band from mid-1971 to mid-1972.<ref>{{cite book|last=Santelli|first = Robert| date = September 28, 2006| title = Greetings From E Street: The Story of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band| publisher = Chronicle Books| isbn = 0-8118-5348-9}}</ref> His songwriting ability included, as his future record label described it in early publicity campaigns, "more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums".

===1972–1974: Initial struggle===
Springsteen was signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 1972 by John Hammond, who had signed [[Bob Dylan]] to the same label a decade earlier. His debut album, ''[[Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.]]'', was released in January 1973, establishing him as a critical favorite.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Bangs |first=Lester |author-link=Lester Bangs |date=July 5, 1973 |title=Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/107193/greetings_from_asbury_park_nj |url-status=dead |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919090512/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/107193/greetings_from_asbury_park_nj |archive-date=September 19, 2008 |access-date=March 21, 2010}}</ref> Because of Springsteen's lyrical poeticism and [[folk rock]]-rooted music exemplified on tracks like "[[Blinded by the Light]]" and "[[For You (Bruce Springsteen song)|For You]]", and his connection with Hammond and Columbia Records, critics initially compared Springsteen to [[Bob Dylan]]. "He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven't heard since I was rocked by '[[Like a Rolling Stone]]'", ''[[Crawdaddy (magazine)|Crawdaddy]]'' magazine editor [[Peter Knobler]] wrote in a March 1973 profile of Springsteen's that included photographs taken by [[Ed Gallucci]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ed Gallucci Photography |url=http://www.edgallucciphotography.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111052624/http://www.edgallucciphotography.com/ |archive-date=January 11, 2014 |access-date=March 17, 2014 |publisher=Ed Gallucci Photography}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=''Glory Days: A Bruce Springsteen Symposium''.

Springsteen's second album, ''[[The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle]]'', was released in November 1973, eleven months after ''Greetings from Asbury Park''. Like Springsteen's inaugural album, ''The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle'' was met with critical acclaim but limited commercial success. Springsteen's songs became grander in form and scope with the E Street Band providing a less folksy, more [[rhythm and blues]] vibe, and lyrics that romanticized teenage street life. "[[4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)]]" and "Incident on 57th Street" became fan favorites, while "[[Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)]]" continues to rank among Springsteen's most beloved concert numbers. "Rosalita" is the ninth-most played song in Springsteen's concert catalog; as of June 2020, he has played it live 809 times.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lifton |first=Dave |date=June 4, 2020 |title=Which Songs Has Bruce Springsteen Played The Most In Concert? |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bruce-springsteen-most-played-songs/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210112040826/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bruce-springsteen-most-played-songs/ |archive-date=January 12, 2021 |access-date=January 8, 2021 |website=UltimateClassicRock.com}}</ref>

In February 1974, [[the Stone Pony]], a music venue and bar, opened on Ocean Avenue in [[Asbury Park]], and Springsteen played there regularly. Several years later, in the early 1980s, prior to the start of the [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]] in June 1984, Springsteen also met his second and current wife [[Patti Scialfa]] at the Stone Pony during her performance there. A regular venue for Springsteen, [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Southside Johnny]], and other acts from the area, the Stone Pony has since been described as "an integral part of music history for decades."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/17/nyregion/stone-pony-asbury-park-nj.html "How a legendary club rode the ups and downs of the Jersey Shore's most rocking town"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 17, 2019</ref>

By the late 1970s, Springsteen earned a reputation as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]] had achieved a U.S. No. 1 pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of ''Greetings''{{'}} "Blinded by the Light" in early 1977. [[Patti Smith]] reached No. 13 with her version of Springsteen's unreleased "[[Because the Night]]" with revised lyrics by Smith in 1978. [[The Pointer Sisters]] hit No. 2 in 1979 with Springsteen's then unreleased "[[Fire (Bruce Springsteen song)|Fire]]".{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|2007|pp=52–54}} Between 1976 and 1978, Springsteen provided four compositions to [[Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes]], including "[[The Fever (Bruce Springsteen song)|The Fever]]" and "Hearts of Stone", and collaborated on four more with [[Steven Van Zandt]], producer of their first three albums.{{sfn|Carlin|2012|pp=}}

In September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear power]] collective at [[Madison Square Garden]] for two nights, playing an abbreviated set while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'' live album, as well as the following summer's ''[[No Nukes (film)|No Nukes]]'' documentary film, represented the first official recordings and footage of Springsteen's fabled live act and Springsteen's first tentative dip into political involvement.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |date=December 26, 2018 |title=Bruce Springsteen Releases Complete 'No Nukes 1979' Concert |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bruce-springsteen-no-nukes-1979-concerts-772755/ |url-status=live |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210116183304/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bruce-springsteen-no-nukes-1979-concerts-772755/ |archive-date=January 16, 2021 |access-date=January 8, 2021}}</ref>

===1984–1986: ''Born in the U.S.A.'' and cultural phenomenon===
In 1984, Springsteen released ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'', which sold 30&nbsp;million worldwide, and became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-20200576.html|title=Bruce Springsteen still shows who's boss|work=Irish Examiner|access-date=February 13, 2021|archive-date=May 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517000523/https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/music/bruce-springsteen-still-shows-whos-boss-200576.html|url-status=live}}</ref> with seven singles hitting the top ten. The [[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|title track]] was a bitter commentary on the treatment of [[Vietnam veteran]]s, some of whom were Springsteen's friends. The lyrics in the verses were entirely unambiguous when listened to, but the anthemic music and the title of the song made it hard for many, from politicians to the common person, to get the lyrics—except those in the chorus, which could be read many ways.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Guterman |first=Jimmy |title=Runaway American Dream |date=2005 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=153}}</ref> The song made a huge political impact, as he was advocating for the rights of the common working-class man.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How Ronald Reagan Changed Bruce Springsteen's Politics |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/bruce-springsteen-ronald-reagan-107448/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220020008/http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/bruce-springsteen-ronald-reagan-107448 |archive-date=December 20, 2015 |access-date=December 14, 2015 |website=[[Politico]]|date=June 4, 2014}}</ref>

[[File:SpringsteenMadison.jpg|thumb|left|Springsteen and [[E Street Band]] member [[Clarence Clemons]] performing in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]]]
The song was widely misinterpreted as [[patriotic]], and in connection with the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential campaign]] became the [[Born in the U.S.A. (song)#Political reactions|subject of considerable folklore]]. In 1984, conservative columnist [[George Will]] attended a Springsteen concert and then wrote a column praising Springsteen's work ethic. Six days after the column's publication, then President [[Ronald Reagan]], in a campaign rally in [[Hammonton, New Jersey]], made brief mention of the song, saying, "America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young Americans admire—New Jersey's own, Bruce Springsteen." Two nights later, at a concert in [[Pittsburgh]], Springsteen told the crowd, "Well, the president was mentioning my name in his speech the other day and I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must've been, you know? I don't think it was the ''Nebraska'' album. I don't think he's been listening to this one." He then began playing "Johnny 99", with its allusions to closing factories and criminals.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dolan |first=Marc |date=April 6, 2014 |title=How Ronald Reagan Changed Bruce Springsteen's Politics |work=Politico |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/bruce-springsteen-ronald-reagan-107448.html |url-status=dead |access-date=July 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809012611/http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/bruce-springsteen-ronald-reagan-107448.html |archive-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref>

"[[Dancing in the Dark (Bruce Springsteen song)|Dancing in the Dark]]" was the biggest of seven hit singles from ''Born in the U.S.A.'', peaking at No. 2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' singles chart. The video for the song showed a young [[Courteney Cox]] dancing on stage with Springsteen, which helped start the actress's career. The song "[[Cover Me (Bruce Springsteen song)|Cover Me]]" was written by Springsteen for [[Donna Summer]], but his record company persuaded him to keep it for the new album. A big fan of Summer's work, Springsteen wrote another song for her, "[[Protection (Donna Summer song)|Protection]]". Videos for ''Born in the U.S.A.'' were directed by [[Brian De Palma]] and [[John Sayles]]. Springsteen played on the "[[We Are the World]]" song and [[We Are the World (album)|album]] in 1985. His live cover of the [[Trapped (Jimmy Cliff song)|Jimmy Cliff song "Trapped"]] from that album received moderate airplay on US Top 40 stations as well as reaching No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CQEAAAAMBAJ&q=billboard%201985&pg=PT52 |title=Billboard |date=May 11, 1985 |access-date=August 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727134630/https://books.google.com/books?id=1CQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT52&q=billboard%201985 |archive-date=July 27, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The ''Born in the U.S.A.'' period represented the height of Springsteen's visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience he would ever reach (aided by the release of [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]'s [[remix|dance mixes]] of three of the singles). From June 15 to August 10, 1985, all seven of his albums appeared on the [[UK Albums Chart]]: the first time an artist had charted their entire back catalogue simultaneously.<ref>Roberts, David.

''[[Live/1975–85]]'', a five-record box set (also on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and became the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the most commercially successful live albums of all time, ultimately selling 13&nbsp;million units in the U.S. During the 1980s, several Springsteen [[fanzines]] were launched, including ''[[Backstreets Magazine|Backstreets]]'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Backstreets |url=https://www.backstreets.com/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210108235901/https://www.backstreets.com/ |archive-date=January 8, 2021 |access-date=January 7, 2021 |website=backstreets.com}}</ref>

=== 1987–1991: ''Tunnel of Love'' and activism ===
Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]'' in October 1987. The album is a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, and the full sound of the E Street Band is included only selectively.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2020|pp=264–271}} Although it sold less than ''Born in the U.S.A.'', it was a commercial success, reaching No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2020|pp=264–271}}<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/1987-11-07/ | title=Billboard 200™ | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

On July 19, 1988, Springsteen's [[Berlin Wall#Bruce Springsteen, 1988|concert in East Germany]] attracted 300,000 spectators. Journalist Erik Kirschbaum called the concert "the most important rock concert ever, anywhere" in his 2013 book ''Rocking the Wall. Bruce Springsteen: The Berlin Concert That Changed the World''. The concert had been conceived by the [[Socialist Unity Party]]'s [[Free German Youth|youth wing]] in an attempt to placate the youth of [[East Germany]], who were hungry for more freedom and the popular music of the West. However, it is Kirschbaum's opinion that the success of the concert catalyzed opposition to the regime in East Germany, and helped contribute to the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] the following year.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Crossland |first=David |date=June 19, 2013 |title=Chimes of Freedom: How Springsteen Helped Tear Down the Wall |work=Der Spiegel |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/book-says-springsteen-concert-helped-bring-down-berlin-wall-a-906236-2.html |url-status=live |access-date=June 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620162251/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/book-says-springsteen-concert-helped-bring-down-berlin-wall-a-906236-2.html |archive-date=June 20, 2013}}</ref>

Later in 1988, Springsteen headlined the worldwide [[Human Rights Now!]] tour for [[Amnesty International]].

===1992–1998: Academy award, ''Greatest Hits'', and soundtracks===
In 1992, after risking fan accusations of "going Hollywood" by moving to Los Angeles and working with [[session musician]]s, Springsteen released two albums at once: ''[[Human Touch]]'' and ''[[Lucky Town]]''.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2020|p=304}}

An electric band appearance on the acoustic ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' television program (later released as ''[[In Concert/MTV Plugged]]'') was poorly received and cemented fan dissatisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hyden |first=Steven |title=Twilight of the Gods |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2018 |isbn=978-0062657138 |page=109}}</ref>

Springsteen won an [[Academy Award]] in 1994 for his song "[[Streets of Philadelphia]]", which appeared on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''. The video for the song shows Springsteen's actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This technique was developed on the "[[Brilliant Disguise#Video|Brilliant Disguise]]" video.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2020|p=288}}

[[File:President Bill Clinton and Bruce Springsteen.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] with Springsteen in December 1997]]

In 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first ''[[Greatest Hits (Bruce Springsteen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary ''[[Blood Brothers (1996 film)|Blood Brothers]]''), and also one show at Tramps in New York City,{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2020|p=354}} he released his second folk album, ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]''. The album was inspired by [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' and by ''Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass'', a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author [[Dale Maharidge]] and photographer [[Michael Williamson (photographer)|Michael Williamson]]. The album was generally less well-received than the thematically similar ''Nebraska'' due to the minimal [[melody]], twangy vocals, and political nature of most of the songs; however, some praised it for giving a voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic [[Ghost of Tom Joad Tour]] that followed presented many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to "shut the fuck up" and not to clap during the performances.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Masciotra |first=David |date=September 16, 2017 |title=Bruce Springsteen's 'The Ghost of Tom Joad', then and now |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/09/16/bruce-springsteens-the-ghost-of-tom-joad-then-and-now/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210104131505/https://www.salon.com/2017/09/16/bruce-springsteens-the-ghost-of-tom-joad-then-and-now/ |archive-date=January 4, 2021 |access-date=January 7, 2021 |website=Salon}}</ref>

===1999–2007: ''The Rising'', ''Devils & Dust'', and other releases===
Springsteen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 by [[Bono]] (the lead singer of U2), a favor he returned in 2005.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Mar |first=Alex |date=February 25, 2005 |title=Springsteen to Induct U2 into Hall of Fame |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/springsteen-to-induct-u2-into-hall-of-fame-20050225 |url-status=live |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403031438/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/springsteen-to-induct-u2-into-hall-of-fame-20050225 |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |access-date=March 18, 2015}}</ref>

In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band reunited and began their extensive [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour|Reunion Tour]], which lasted over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at [[Continental Airlines Arena]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] and a ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City's Madison Square Garden. A new song played at these shows, "[[American Skin (41 Shots)]]" (about the police shooting of [[Amadou Diallo]]), proved controversial.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2020|pp=609–610}}

[[File:RisingTourGiantsStadiumLot.jpg|thumb|The scene outside [[Giants Stadium]] during Springsteen's record-setting, 10-night stand at the stadium on [[The Rising Tour]] in July 2003]]
In 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, ''[[The Rising (album)|The Rising]]'', produced by [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]]. The album, mostly a reflection on the [[September 11 attacks]], was a critical and popular success.

Springsteen discussed the future of the E Street Band, saying he wants to "play more often with less dates" and that "it’s very exciting to play with the E Street Band now, and I’m looking forward to doing a good deal of it in the future. But that future is finite." He said he would also like to do another solo tour similar to his Broadway shows.

He used it to lyricize "America's slide from industrial-era swagger into service-economy [[anomie]]". In her mind, Springsteen needed the "track-by-track architecture of albums to flesh out characters, relate each to the other, extend metaphors and build a palpable, detail-strewn landscape through which they could travel". He simultaneously grew musically "both with his stalwart E Street Band (a metaphor itself for the family connections and community spirit his songs celebrate or lament) and in more minimalist projects."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Powers |first=Ann |date=January 26, 2009 |title=CD: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-jan-26-et-springsteen26-story.html |url-status=live |access-date=March 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210125104123/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-jan-26-et-springsteen26-story.html |archive-date=January 25, 2021}}</ref>

Springsteen received press criticism for the apparent haste in which he and Scialfa started their relationship.
