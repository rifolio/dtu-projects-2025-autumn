His first solo effort, the 1996 song "[[Hands of Death (Burn Baby Burn)]]" (with [[Alice Cooper]]), was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]]. His debut solo studio album, ''[[Hellbilly Deluxe]]'', was released in 1998. ''Hellbilly Deluxe'' sold over 3 million copies worldwide and spawned three singles. His second studio album, ''[[The Sinister Urge (album)|The Sinister Urge]]'', was released in 2001 and became his second platinum album in the U.S. His third studio album, ''[[Educated Horses]]'', was released in 2006. It became his third album to enter the top 10 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], but saw a decrease in sales compared to his previous releases. His fourth studio album, ''[[Hellbilly Deluxe 2]]'', released in 2010 and peaked at no. 8 in the U.S. A remix album, ''[[Mondo Sex Head]]'', released in 2012 and was followed by his fifth album ''[[Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor]]'' in 2013. In 2016, Zombie released his sixth album, ''[[The Electric Warlock Acid Witch Satanic Orgy Celebration Dispenser]]'', and his seventh studio album, ''[[The Lunar Injection Kool Aid Eclipse Conspiracy]]'', was released in 2021.

Zombie directed the horror film ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' in 2000, though the controversial project was not released until 2003, and has since been described as a cult classic. Zombie followed the film with two sequels in his ''Rejects'' trilogy: ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005) and ''[[3 from Hell]]'' (2019). After the success of his first two films he directed ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'' (2007), a remake of the classic [[Halloween (1978 film)|1978 horror film]]. The film became his highest-grossing to date, though was generally received negatively by critics. He later directed ''[[Halloween II (2009 film)|Halloween II]]'' (2009), which failed to match the commercial success of its predecessor. Zombie has also directed the films ''[[The Haunted World of El Superbeasto]]'' (2009), ''[[The Lords of Salem (film)|The Lords of Salem]]'' (2012), ''[[31 (film)|31]]'' (2016), and [[The Munsters (2022 film)|''The Munsters'']] (2022).
