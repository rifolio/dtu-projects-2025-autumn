The lawsuit alleged that Minaj had engaged in copyright infringement (a) by creating the song "Sorry" and (b) by distributing it; she requested an injunction to prevent Minaj from releasing the song. According to the lawsuit, Chapman has a policy of declining all requests for permission to sample her songs. In September 2020, District Court Judge [[Virginia A. Phillips]] granted summary judgment in favor of Minaj on the first count of her complaint, stating that Minaj's experimentation with Chapman's song constituted [[fair use]] rather than [[copyright infringement]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2020/music/news/nicki-minaj-copyright-lawsuit-tracy-chapman-1234772693/ |title=Judge Rules in Favor of Nicki Minaj in Tracy Chapman Copyright Dispute |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 16, 2020 |first=Gene |last=Maddaus |access-date=September 18, 2020}}</ref> However, the judge ruled that the second count of the complaint should go to trial.
