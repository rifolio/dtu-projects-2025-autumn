'''Judas Priest''' a<!-- NOTE: "are" is correct British English. Do NOT change to "is" -->re an English [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Birmingham]] in 1969. They have sold over 50 million albums and are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time.

During the 1970s, the core of bassist [[Ian Hill]], lead singer [[Rob Halford]] and guitarists [[Glenn Tipton]] and [[K. K. Downing]] saw a revolving cast of drummers (with [[Les Binks]] being the only one who played on more than one album), before [[Dave Holland (drummer)|Dave Holland]] joined them for ten years beginning in 1979. Since Holland's departure, [[Scott Travis]] has been the band's drummer. Halford left Judas Priest in 1992, and after a four-year hiatus, they regrouped in 1996 with [[Tim "Ripper" Owens]] (formerly of [[Winter's Bane]]) replacing him. After two albums with Owens, Halford returned to the band in 2003. Downing left Judas Priest in 2011, replaced by [[Richie Faulkner]]. The current line-up consists of Hill, Tipton, Travis, Halford and Faulkner; although Tipton remains as an official member of the band, he has limited his touring activities since 2018 due to [[Parkinson's disease]], with [[Andy Sneap]] filling in for him. Hill and Tipton are the only two members of the band to appear on every album.

Halford's operatic vocal style and the twin guitar sound of Downing and Tipton have been a major influence on heavy metal bands. Judas Priest's image of leather, spikes, and other taboo articles of clothing was widely influential during the glam metal era of the 1980s. ''[[The Guardian]]'' referred to ''British Steel'' as the record that defines heavy metal. Despite a decline in exposure during the mid-1990s, the band have once again seen a resurgence, including worldwide tours, being inaugural inductees into the [[VH1 Rock Honors]] in 2006, receiving a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] in 2010, and having their songs featured in video games such as ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series. In 2022, the band were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] via the Award for Musical Excellence.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2022-05-04 |title=At last – Judas Priest will finally make it into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame |url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/judas-priest-rock-roll-hall-fame-2022 |access-date=2022-05-06 |website=loudersound |language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Origins (1969–1974) ===
Judas Priest were formed in 1969 in [[Birmingham]],<ref name="Bowe">{{harvnb|Bowe|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-hIN6L4zyTgC&pg=PA27 27]}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Regeniter|first=Anna|date=2018-03-12 |title=Reise Know-How CityTrip Birmingham|language=de |publisher=Reise Know-How Verlag Peter Rump|isbn=978-3-8317-4930-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gh4DwAAQBAJ&q=birmingham+Judas+Priest&pg=PA81}}</ref> England, by lead vocalist [[Al Atkins]] and bassist Brian "Bruno" Stapenhill, with John Perry on guitars and John "Fezza" Partridge on drums. Perry took his own life at age 18,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/original-judas-priest-singer-talks-about-his-early-songwriting-contributions-to-band/|title=Original JUDAS PRIEST Singer Talks About His Early Songwriting Contributions To Band|date=22 June 2008|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=30 April 2021}}</ref> and amongst the replacements the band auditioned was future Judas Priest guitarist [[K. K. Downing|Kenneth "K. K." Downing]]; at the time, they turned him down in favour of 17-year-old multi-instrumentalist Ernest Chataway, who had played with Birmingham band [[Black Sabbath]] when they were still called Earth.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=2}} Stapenhill came up with the name Judas Priest from [[Bob Dylan]]'s song "[[The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest]]" on the album ''[[John Wesley Harding]]''.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|pp=2–3}} Partridge was replaced in 1970 by drummer Fred Woolley, who later re-joined Chataway and Stapenhill in the band Bullion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brumbeat.net/judaspri.htm |title=Judas Priest early years|website=Brumbeat.net|access-date=30 April 2021}}</ref> No member of that early line-up lasted long enough to play on the band's recordings, though several songs co-written by Atkins appeared on their first two albums.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=2}}

The band recorded a two-song demo "Good Time Woman" and "We'll Stay Together" and eventually gained a three-album recording contract with the label Immediate in late 1969 after a gig in [[Walsall]],{{efn|The gig was on 25 November 1969, and [[Led Zeppelin]] vocalist [[Robert Plant]] was in the audience.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=3}}}} but the label went out of business before an album could be recorded, and the band split in 1970. Late in the year, Atkins found a [[heavy rock]] band called Freight rehearsing without a singer, made up of K. K. Downing on guitars, his childhood friend [[Ian Hill|Ian "Skull" Hill]] on bass, and drummer John Ellis.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=3}} He joined them, and they took on Atkins' defunct band's name. Their first gig was on 6 March 1971. Ellis quit later that year and was replaced with [[Alan Moore (drummer)|Alan Moore]]. Early shows included [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Quatermass (band)|Quatermass]] covers, and in 1972, the set list included the originals "Never Satisfied", "Winter", and the show-closer "Caviar and Meths".{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=4}} July 1971 also saw them making a [[Single (music)|45 rpm]] demo of "Mind Conception" with "Holy is the Man" on the B-side for the Zella Records label.

Moore left and was replaced with Chris "Congo" Campbell and the band joined the management agency of [[Black Sabbath]] guitarist [[Tony Iommi]], Iommi Management Agency.{{efn|The Iommi Management Agency changed its name to Tramp Entertainments in 1973.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=5}} }} Atkins continued to write material for the band—including "Whiskey Woman", which became the base for the Judas Priest staple "[[Victim of Changes (song)|Victim of Changes]]"—but as finances were tight and he had a family to support, he played his last gigs with the band in December 1972 and left the band in May 1973.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|pp=5–7}} Campbell left soon afterwards, later to surface in the band Machine,<ref>{{Cite web|title=MACHINE|url=https://www.boredteenagers.co.uk/MACHINEwithnames.htm|access-date=2020-08-27|website=Boredteenagers.co.uk}}</ref> and the band enlisted two members of the band Hiroshima: drummer [[John Hinch (musician)|John Hinch]] and vocalist [[Rob Halford]], the brother of Hill's girlfriend.{{efn|Hill and Sue Halford were married from 1976 to 1984 and have a son together.{{sfn|Wang|2008}} }} Halford and Hinch played their first show with the band in May 1973 at the [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|Townhouse]] in [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]]. The show was recorded and part of it released in 2019 on the compilation ''Downer-Rock Asylum''<ref>{{Cite web |last=LiveMetal |date=January 7, 2021 |title=Judas Priest - Live 1973 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5QZvyT1gog |website=YouTube}}</ref> on the Audio Archives label along with one live song from the Atkins era.

Judas Priest made their first tour of continental Europe in early 1974 and they returned to England that April to sign a recording deal with the label [[Gull (record label)|Gull]].{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=8}} Gull suggested adding a fifth member to fill in the band's sound; they took on as a second lead guitarist [[Glenn Tipton]],{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=8}} whose group [[the Flying Hat Band]] were also managed by Iommi's agency.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=5}}

=== ''Rocka Rolla'' (1974–1975) ===
Judas Priest went into the studio in June–July 1974 with Black Sabbath producer [[Rodger Bain]].{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=17}} The band released their debut single "Rocka Rolla" and followed it with the [[Rocka Rolla|album of the same name]] in September.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=17}} The album features a variety of styles—straight-up rock, heavy riffing, and [[Progressive rock|progressive]].{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=16}}

Technical problems during the recording contributed to the poor sound quality of the record. Producer [[Rodger Bain]], whose resume included [[Black Sabbath]]'s first three albums and [[Budgie (band)|Budgie]]'s [[Budgie (album)|first album]], dominated the production of the album and made decisions with which the band did not agree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thexquorum.com/mad/ROCKAROLLA.html |title=Judas Priest Info Pages – Rocka Rolla |website= Thexquorum.com |access-date=10 August 2014}}</ref> Bain also chose to leave fan favourites from the band's live set, such as "Tyrant", "Genocide" and "[[The Ripper (song)|The Ripper]]", from the album and he cut the song "Caviar and Meths" from a 10-minute song down to a 2-minute instrumental.

The tour for ''Rocka Rolla'' was the band's first international tour<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thexquorum.com/mad/BEGINNINGS.html#APRIL%201974 |title=Judas Priest Info Pages – Forging The Metal |publisher=Thexquorum.com |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref> with dates in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark including one show at Hotel Klubben<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nordicchoicehotels.no/Quality/Quality-Hotel-Klubben/ |title=Hotell Sentralt i Tønsberg – Quality Hotel Klubben |publisher=Nordicchoicehotels.no |access-date=18 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715190855/https://www.nordicchoicehotels.no/quality/quality-hotel-klubben/ |archive-date=15 July 2014}}</ref> in Tønsberg, one hour from Oslo, Norway, which scored them a somewhat negative review in the local press.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kkdowning.net/pictography/scrapbooks/scrap2/lydsjokk.jpg |title=Newspaper cutting : Lydsjokk pa Klubben |publisher=Kkdowning.net |access-date=19 April 2014}}</ref> The album flopped upon release, leaving Priest in dire financial straits.

=== ''Sad Wings of Destiny'' (1975–1977) ===
Judas Priest performed "Rocka Rolla" on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'' in 1975, as well as the "Dreamer Deceiver"–"Deceiver" pair the year before the songs appeared on ''Sad Wings of Destiny''.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=34}} Hinch left the band for reasons that are disputed and was replaced with Alan Moore,{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=32}} who returned to the band in October 1975.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=39}} Finances were tight: band members restricted themselves to one meal a day—and several took on part-time work—while they recorded their follow-up album on a budget of £2,000.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|pp=39, 41}} The group intended to make an album mixing straight-ahead rock with a [[Progressive rock|progressive]] edge.{{sfn|Daniels|2007|p=99}}

The band recorded ''[[Sad Wings of Destiny]]'' over two weeks in November and December 1975 at [[Rockfield Studios]] in Wales.{{sfn|Daniels|2007|p=96}} The band stayed sober during the 12-hour recording sessions.{{sfn|Daniels|2007|p=99}} The cover depicts a struggling, grounded angel surrounded by flames and wearing a devil's three-pronged cross,{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=27}} which became the band's symbol.{{sfn|Daniels|2007|p=100}} The album was released in March 1976,{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=30}} with "[[The Ripper (song)|The Ripper]]" as its lead single.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=33}} The band supported the album with a headlining tour{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=39}} of the UK from April to June 1976.{{sfn|Daniels|2007|p=101}} By this time Halford joked that fans should burn their copies of ''Rocka Rolla''.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=29}}

The album had little commercial success at first{{sfn|Huey}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Sad Wings of Destiny - Judas Priest &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|work=[[AllMusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sad-wings-of-destiny-mw0000201463|access-date=2014-05-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217173214/http://www.allmusic.com/album/sad-wings-of-destiny-mw0000201463|archive-date=17 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=March 2021}} and had difficulty getting noticed due to critical competition from the rise of [[punk rock]],{{sfn|Bowe|2009|p=39}} though it had a positive review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=39}} Fans, critics, and the band have since come to see ''Sad Wings of Destiny'' as the album on which Judas Priest consolidated their sound and image.{{sfn|Daniels|2007|p=100}} It features heavy [[riff]]ing and complex song [[arrangement]]s that Tipton and Downing have said were inspired by the factories of the [[Black Country]].{{sfn|Cope|2013|p=110}} The album's centrepiece "[[Victim of Changes]]" evolved from a combination of Atkins' "Whiskey Woman" and Halford's "Red Light Woman", and went on to become a fan favourite.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=27}}

The band grew dissatisfied with Gull;{{sfn|Popoff|2007|pp=41–42}} the tight finances led Moore to leave the band a second time{{when|date=January 2021||reason=The next section says Moore left during the ''Sin After Sin'' recording sessions.}}—this time permanently.{{sfn|Daniels|2007|p=102}} ''Sad Wings of Destiny'' caught the attention of {{not a typo|[[Columbia Records|CBS Records]]}}, and with the help of new manager David Hemmings, the band signed with CBS and received a £60,000 budget for their next album. The signing required breaking their contract with Gull, resulting in the rights to the first two albums and all related recordings—including demos—becoming property of Gull.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|pp=41–42}} Gull periodically repackaged and re-released the material from these albums.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=122}}

=== ''Sin After Sin'', ''Stained Class'' and ''Killing Machine'' (1977–1979) ===
Judas Priest recorded their major-label debut, ''[[Sin After Sin]]'', in January 1977 at [[the Who]]'s [[Ramport Studios]], with [[Deep Purple]] bassist [[Roger Glover]] as producer.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=49}} Moore left again during the album's sessions{{Clarify timeframe|date=January 2021}} and was replaced by session drummer [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]].{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=44}} The album features significant developments in heavy metal technique, in particular its use of [[double kick|double-kick]] drumming on tracks such as "[[Dissident Aggressor]]",{{sfn|Cope|2013|p=114}} and includes a pop-metal cover of "[[Diamonds & Rust (song)|Diamonds & Rust]]" by folk singer [[Joan Baez]].{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=50}}

''[[Sin After Sin]]'' appeared in April 1977.{{sfn|Popoff|2007|p=2}} It was the first Priest record under a major label, [[Columbia Records|CBS]], and the first of eleven consecutive albums to be certified Gold or [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{cite web |title=How Judas Priest Began Their March to Stardom on 'Sin After Sin' |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/judas-priest-sin-after-sin/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=8 April 2017 |access-date=15 October 2020}}</ref> Phillips declined to become a permanent member of Judas Priest, so the band hired [[Les Binks]] on Glover's recommendation. Together, they recorded ''[[Stained Class]]'', produced by Dennis MacKay, and ''[[Killing Machine]]'' (released in North America as ''Hell Bent for Leather''), both released in 1978.{{sfn|Daniels|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qRTEsW44NDQC&pg=PT95 SIX: 1977–1979]}} Binks was credited with co-writing "[[Beyond the Realms of Death]]". Binks also played on ''[[Unleashed in the East]]'' (1979), which was recorded live in Japan during the Killing Machine tour. ''Killing Machine'' was the first nod to a more commercial sound, with simpler songs that brought back some blues influences. At about the same time, the band members adopted their now-famous "leather-and-studs" image.<ref name="Bukszpan">{{cite book |last=Bukszpan |first=Daniel |year=2003 |title=The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal |publisher=Barnes & Noble Publishing |isbn=9780760742181 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YaDDsg0H35gC&pg=PT94}}</ref>

=== Mainstream success years (1979–1991) ===
[[File:Judas Priest dal viṿ a Cardiff in dal 1981.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Judas Priest performing in 1981, during their [[World Wide Blitz Tour]]]]
Following the release of ''[[Killing Machine]]'' (1978) was the live release from the supporting tour, ''[[Unleashed in the East]]'' (1979). It was the first of many Judas Priest albums to go platinum. There was some criticism of the band's use of studio enhancements and [[overdubbing]] in what was marketed as a live album.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r10662|pure_url=yes}}| title= Unleashed in the East > Overview' |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date =23 April 2007}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=March 2021}} By this point the playing style of the band had grown progressively heavier, with live versions of songs such as "Exciter", "Tyrant" and "Diamonds and Rust" sounding much heavier and faster than their studio counterparts.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Les Binks quit in late 1979, as he was unhappy with the band's manager Mike Dolan's decision not to pay him for his performance on the live album,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kkdowning.net/steelmill/Interviews/beyond-realms-les-binks/|title=Beyond The Realms of Les Binks|website=Kkdowning.net|date=28 March 2017 |language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> so they replaced him with [[Dave Holland (drummer)|Dave Holland]], formerly of the band [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]]. With this line-up, Judas Priest recorded six studio and one live album, which garnered different degrees of critical and financial success.

In 1980, the band released ''[[British Steel (album)|British Steel]]''. The songs were shorter and had more mainstream radio hooks, but retained the familiar heavy metal feel. Tracks such as "[[United (Judas Priest song)|United]]", "[[Breaking the Law]]", and "[[Living After Midnight]]" were frequently played on the radio. The next release, 1981's ''[[Point of Entry]]'', followed the same formula, and [[British Steel Tour|the tour in support]] of the album featured new songs such as "Solar Angels" and "[[Heading Out to the Highway]]".

The 1982 album ''[[Screaming for Vengeance]]'' featured "[[You've Got Another Thing Comin']]", which became a major radio hit in the US. Songs such as "[[Electric Eye (song)|Electric Eye]]" and "Riding on the Wind" also appeared on this album, and proved to be popular live. "(Take These) Chains" (by [[Bob Halligan Jr.]]) was released as a single. This album went Double Platinum.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://members.firstinter.net/markster/SCREAMINGFORVENGEANCE.html| title=Screaming for Vengeance Info Page |publisher=Judas Priest Info Pages}}</ref>

On 29 May 1983, the band played on Heavy Metal Day of the [[US Festival]], a music festival in [[San Bernardino, California]] sponsored by [[Steve Wozniak]]. The band was fourth in the line-up that also included [[Quiet Riot]], [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Triumph (band)|Triumph]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], and [[Van Halen]].

[[File:Judas Priest K.K. Downing Glenn Tipton, 1984.jpg|thumb|left|Downing and Tipton performing in [[San Sebastián]], Spain, during their Metal Conqueror Tour of 1984]]
Priest continued their success through the mid-1980s. "[[Freewheel Burning]]", released in 1983, was a regular on rock radio. Its album ''[[Defenders of the Faith]]'' was released the following year. Some critics dubbed it "Screaming for Vengeance II", due to its musical similarity to the previous album.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://members.firstinter.net/markster/DEFENDERSOFTHEFAITH.html| title=Defenders of the Faith Info Page| publisher=Judas Priest Info Pages| url-status=dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070205180937/http://members.firstinter.net/markster/DEFENDERSOFTHEFAITH.html| archive-date=5 February 2007}}</ref>

On 13 July 1985, Judas Priest, along with [[Black Sabbath]] and other performers, played [[Live Aid]] at [[JFK Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Their setlist included "Living After Midnight", "[[The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Pronged Crown)#Judas Priest version|The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Pronged Crown)]]" and "(You've Got) Another Thing Comin'".

''[[Turbo (Judas Priest album)|Turbo]]'' was released in April 1986. The band adopted a more colourful stage look and gave their music a more mainstream feel by adding [[guitar synthesizer]]s. The album also went Platinum and had a successful arena tour in support, with 100 concerts in North America, Europe and Japan in 1986. A live album recorded on the tour, titled ''[[Priest...Live!]]'', was released the next year, offering live tracks from the era. The video documentary ''[[Heavy Metal Parking Lot]]'' was created by [[Jeff Krulik]] and John Heyn in 1986. It documents the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans waiting on 31 May 1986 for Priest's concert (with special guests [[Dokken]]) at the Capital Center (later renamed [[US Airways Arena (Washington, D.C.)|US Airways Arena]]) in [[Landover, Maryland]].

In May 1988, ''[[Ram It Down]]'' was released, featuring several reworked songs left over from ''Turbo'', in addition to new songs. The band recorded three tracks with pop producers [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Stock-Aitken-Waterman]]: two originals, "Runaround"<ref>{{cite web|title=Songs&nbsp;- RUNAROUND – BY STOCK / AITKEN / WATERMAN |publisher=Mike Stock Publishing |website=Mikestockmusic.com |url=http://www.mikestockmusic.com/songDisplay.php?id=49 |access-date=22 January 2018|year=1988|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126055817/http://www.mikestockmusic.com/songDisplay.php?id=49 |archive-date=26 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and "I Will Return",<ref>{{cite web |title=Songs&nbsp;- I WILL RETURN – BY STOCK / AITKEN / WATERMAN |publisher=Mike Stock Publishing |website=Mikestockmusic.com |url=http://www.mikestockmusic.com/songDisplay.php?id=48 |access-date=22 January 2018 |year=1988|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126051713/http://www.mikestockmusic.com/songDisplay.php?id=48 |archive-date=26 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and a cover of the Stylistics' hit "[[You Are Everything]]". Producer [[Matt Aitken]] said of the sessions, "I think it was ill-conceived, it was unlikely it was going to work. But we went into it with the spirit of optimism, and we did the best with them, within the parameters within which we would be prepared to work. We weren't going to use live drum kits and stuff, and that probably made it a no go from the start. I have no idea why we were working with Judas Priest really, but I think we made a good fist of a heavy metal song. I think it sounded alright."<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Journey Through Stock Aitken Waterman: Ep 41: Looking Back with Matt Aitken on Apple Podcasts |url=https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/ep-41-looking-back-with-matt-aitken/id1565879477?i=1000583585235 |access-date=2022-10-24 |website=Apple Podcasts |language=en-AU}}</ref> The tracks were ultimately not included on this album due to a management decision.

A reviewer has called ''Ram It Down'' a "stylistic evolution" that resulted from the band's "attempt to rid themselves of the tech synthesiser approach&nbsp;... and return to the traditional metal of their fading glory days". The reviewer argued the album showed "how far behind they were lagging&nbsp;... the [[thrash metal|thrashers]] they helped influence" in earlier years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kickedintheface.com/reviews/Judas_Priest-Ram_It_Down.htm |title= Judas Priest – Ram It Down |website=Kickedintheface.com |access-date=10 August 2014 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206174526/http://www.kickedintheface.com/reviews/Judas_Priest-Ram_It_Down.htm |archive-date=6 December 2009}}</ref> In 1989, longtime drummer Dave Holland left the band.

In September 1990, the ''[[Painkiller (Judas Priest album)|Painkiller]]'' album used a new drummer, [[Scott Travis]] (formerly from [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]]), who gave the band an edgier sound thanks to his heavy use of double pedals. This comeback album also dropped the 1980s-style synthesisers for all songs except "[[A Touch of Evil]]". The tour used bands such as [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]], [[Megadeth]], [[Pantera]], [[Sepultura]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]] as opening bands, and culminated in the [[Rock in Rio]] performance in Brazil in front of 100,000+ fans.

Part of the Judas Priest stage show often featured Halford riding onstage on a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorbike, dressed in motorcycle leathers and sunglasses. During a Toronto show in August 1991, Halford was seriously injured as he rode on stage, when he collided with a drum riser hidden behind clouds of dry ice mist. Though the show was delayed, he performed the set before going to a hospital. Hill later noted "he must have been in agony". In a 2007 interview, Halford said the accident had nothing to do with his departure from the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/spotlights/story.html?id=b78b4958-bf9c-4d93-85b8-16ed6546e29d|title=Q&A; with Rob Halford |date=17 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117224416/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/spotlights/story.html?id=b78b4958-bf9c-4d93-85b8-16ed6546e29d|access-date=30 April 2021|archive-date=17 January 2008}}</ref>

==== Subliminal message trial ====
In 1990, Judas Priest was the subject of civil action in the United States which alleged that the band was responsible for an incident in [[Sparks, Nevada]], in 1985 in which 20-year-old James Vance and 18-year-old Raymond Belknap shot themselves.<ref name="trial">{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Timothy |date=November–December 1996 |url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/1996/11/scientific-consensus-and-expert-testimony-lessons-from-the-judas-priest-trial/ |title=Scientific Consensus and Expert Testimony: Lessons from the Judas Priest Trial |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |access-date =18 November 2006}}</ref> On the evening of 23 December 1985, Vance and Belknap went to a church playground with a [[12-gauge]] shotgun with the purpose of committing suicide. They had consumed [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[Cannabis|marijuana]] earlier that evening. The lawsuit alleged that the pair had been listening to Judas Priest's 1978 album ''[[Stained Class]]'' that night. Belknap was the first to place the shotgun under his chin, and died instantly after pulling the trigger. Some time later, Vance also shot himself, but succeeded only in disfiguring himself by blowing away the lower half of his face. Vance died three years later of a suspected drug overdose.<ref name="LATimes">{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-12-01-mn-828-story.html|title=Man Who Sued Rock Group Over Suicide Attempt Dies|date=1 December 1988|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

The Belknap and Vance families sued Judas Priest and its members, alleging that the band had embedded [[subliminal message]]s such as "try suicide", "do it" and "let's be dead" in the band's cover of the 1969 [[Spooky Tooth]] song "[[Better by You, Better than Me]]". Judas Priest had recorded the cover at the urging of their record company after the rest of ''Stained Class'' had been completed. The plaintiffs alleged that this subliminal command was the trigger which led directly to the pair deciding to shoot themselves.<ref name="trial" /> Vance's parents said that their son had been troubled for a long time prior to the suicide pact, but had recently "changed for the better" and had re-embraced his family's [[Christianity|Christian faith]] before the "garbage music" of Judas Priest had again led him astray.<ref name="trial" />

Local fans of heavy metal protested during the trial, calling for Judas Priest to be exonerated. The plaintiffs played the song at various speeds and backward, alleging the use of [[backmasking]].<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Rolling Stone |title=Judas Priest's Subliminal Message Trial: Rob Halford Looks Back |date=August 24, 2015 |first=Kory |last=Grow |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/judas-priests-subliminal-message-trial-rob-halford-looks-back-57552/}}</ref> The trial lasted from 16 July to 24 August 1990, when the judge dismissed the lawsuit on the basis that the so-called subliminal message "was a coincidental convergence of a guitar chord with an exhalation pattern".<ref name="trial" /> One of the defense witnesses, Dr. Timothy E. Moore, wrote an article for ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' chronicling the trial.<ref name="trial" /> The trial was covered in a 1991 documentary film, ''Dream Deceivers: The Story Behind James Vance Vs.

===Halford's departure and Ripper years (1991–2003)===
After the ''Painkiller'' tour ended in August 1991, there were indications of internal tensions within the band. Halford went on to form a street-style [[thrash metal]] group named [[Fight (band)|Fight]], with Scott Travis on drums for the recording sessions. He formed this band to explore new musical territory, but due to contractual obligations, he remained with Judas Priest until May 1992.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://members.firstinter.net/markster/WAROFWORDS.html |title=War of Words Info Page |publisher=Judas Priest Info Pages|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205181115/http://members.firstinter.net/markster/WAROFWORDS.html|archive-date=5 February 2007}}</ref> In his 2020 memoir ''Confess'', Halford blamed his departure on a "miscommunication", rather than an intentional desire to quit the band.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gary Graff |date=5 October 2020 |title=Judas Priest 'Metal God' Rob Halford talks music, addiction, sexuality & more in new 'Confess' memoir |url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2020/10/judas-priest-metal-god-rob-halford-talks-music-addiction-sexuality-more-in-new-confess-memoir.html |website=cleveland.com |access-date=19 February 2021}}</ref>

Halford collaborated with Judas Priest in the release of a compilation album entitled ''[[Metal Works '73–'93]]'' to commemorate their 20th anniversary. He also appeared in a video by the same title, documenting their history, in which his departure from the band was officially announced later that year.

The remaining members of Judas Priest spent the next few years searching for a replacement for Halford.

In a February 1998 interview on [[MTV]], Halford [[came out]] as gay.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429870/19980205/halford_rob.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008083600/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429870/19980205/halford_rob.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 October 2008 |date=5 February 1998 |title=Rob Halford Discusses Sexuality Publicly for the First Time |publisher=[[MTV News]] |access-date=24 May 2010}}</ref>

=== Reunion and ''Angel of Retribution'' (2003–2006) ===
[[File:Judas Priest Retribution 2005 Tour.jpg|thumb|left|The reunited Judas Priest performing in 2005]]

After eleven years apart, faced with an ever-growing demand for a reunion, Judas Priest and Rob Halford announced they would reunite in July 2003, to coincide with the release of the ''[[Metalogy]]'' box set (despite Halford's earlier insistence that he "would never do it"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/halford_int.htm |title=Interview with Rob Halford of Two |publisher=NY Rock |access-date=7 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907132550/http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/halford_int.htm |archive-date=7 September 2012}}</ref>). They did a concert tour in Europe in 2004, and co-headlined the 2004 [[Ozzfest]], being named as the "premier act" by almost all US media coverage of the event. Judas Priest and "Ripper" Owens parted amicably, with Owens joining American heavy metal band [[Iced Earth]].

A new studio album, ''[[Angel of Retribution]]'', was released on 1 March 2005 (US) on [[Sony Music]]/[[Epic Records]] to critical and commercial success, earning the band a 2005 [[Metal Hammer]] Golden Gods Award for Best Album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=14029 |title=Metal Hammer Award Winners Announced |website=Metalunderground.com |access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> A global tour in support of the album ensued. As for the band Halford, writing for the fourth release was cut off. After the Retribution tour in June 2006, however, Halford announced he would create his own record company, Metal God Entertainment, where he would release all his solo material under his own control. In November 2006 he remastered his back catalogue and released it exclusively through [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iTunes Store]]. Two new songs allegedly set for the fourth release, "Forgotten Generation" and "Drop Out", were released through iTunes as well.

Along with [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Def Leppard]], Judas Priest was an inaugural inductee into the "[[VH1 Rock Honors]]".<ref name="VH1 rock" /> The ceremony took place on 25 May 2006 in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], Nevada, and first aired on 31 May.<ref name="VH1 rock">{{Cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/rock_honors/2006/honorees.jhtml?honoree=2 |title= VH1.com: Rock Honors 2006 - Honorees: Judas Priest |date=31 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331094623/http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/rock_honors/2006/honorees.jhtml?honoree=2 |access-date=30 April 2021 |archive-date=31 March 2009}}</ref> Their presentation was preceded by [[Godsmack]] performing a medley of "[[Electric Eye (song)|Electric Eye]]"/"[[Victim of Changes (song)|Victim of Changes]]"/"[[Hell Bent for Leather (song)|Hell Bent for Leather]]." Judas Priest then played "[[Breaking the Law]]", "[[The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)]]" and "[[You've Got Another Thing Comin']]", before which Halford rode a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle onstage.

=== ''Nostradamus'' (2006–2010) ===
In a June 2006 interview with MTV.com, Halford said of the group's concept album about the 16th-century French writer [[Nostradamus]], "Nostradamus is all about metal, isn't he? He was an alchemist as well as a seer – a person of extraordinary talent. He had an amazing life that was full of trial and tribulation and joy and sorrow. He's a very human character and a world-famous individual. You can take his name and translate it into any language and everybody knows about him, and that's important because we're dealing with a worldwide audience."<ref name="roadrunnerrecords.com">{{cite news |title=Work on New Album Is 'Going Incredibly Well' |date=12 September 2006 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=58296 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |access-date=18 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000721/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=58296 |archive-date=1 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition to digging new lyrical ground for the band, the album would contain musical elements which might surprise fans. "It's going to have a lot of depth", Halford said. "There'll be a lot of symphonic elements. We might orchestrate it, without it being overblown. There may be a massive choir at parts and keyboards will be featured more prominently, whereas they've always been in the background before."<ref name="roadrunnerrecords.com" /> The album ''[[Nostradamus (album)|Nostradamus]]'' was released in June 2008; the band began a support tour in that same month.<ref>{{cite web| last=Saulnier| first=Jason| date=16 April 2011| title=Rob Halford Interview, Judas Priest Singer talks Rare Recordings| publisher=Music Legends| url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/rob-halford-interview/| access-date=3 May 2013| archive-date=4 August 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804040820/http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/rob-halford-interview/| url-status=dead}}</ref>

In early February 2009, the band joined the ranks of bands speaking out against ticket-touting ("scalping"), issuing a statement condemning the practice of selling tickets at well above face value, and urging fans to buy tickets only from official sources.<ref>{{cite web|title=Judas Priest Issues Warning About Ticket Prices|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/64383/judas_priest|access-date=13 February 2009|date=12 February 2009|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}</ref> In the same month, Judas Priest continued their tour, bringing their "Priest Feast" (with guests [[Megadeth]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]]) to multiple arenas in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland in February and March 2009. From there the tour progressed to multiple venues in Sweden. Later in March, Judas Priest performed in Portugal (at Lisbon on the Atlantic Pavilion), which they had not visited since 2005. The tour then continued to [[Milan]], Italy, and then Paris, France; Halford had last performed with Judas Priest in Paris in 1991.

[[File:Judas Priest Sweden Rock 2008.jpg|thumb|Judas Priest headlined the [[Sweden Rock Festival]] in June 2008.]]
From June through August 2009, Judas Priest completed a North American tour to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of ''[[British Steel (album)|British Steel]]'' (1980); the album was performed in its entirety on each tour date, with some other songs thrown in. This tour was to be a joint effort with fellow Englishman [[David Coverdale]] and [[Whitesnake]]. Unfortunately, Whitesnake would have to leave the tour after the show in Denver, Colorado on 11 August 2009 due to Coverdale falling ill with a serious throat infection; he was advised to stop singing immediately to avoid permanently damaging his vocal cords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaspriest.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=2A15DF96-5A35-4777-8ED8-46B113F97448 |title=Message from Judas Priest after US Tour |publisher=Judaspriest.com |date=24 August 2009 |access-date=7 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaspriest.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=4FC150D2-BF3F-49DA-B9A0-ADBAB3A12448 |title=Whitesnake tour announcement |publisher=Judaspriest.com |date=13 August 2009 |access-date=7 November 2010}}</ref>

On 14 July 2009, Judas Priest released a new live album, featuring 11 previously unreleased live tracks from the 2005 and 2008 world tours, titled ''[[A Touch of Evil: Live]]''.

In May 2010, Halford said the band had been offered a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but "we've just never been there when they wanted to do the ceremony." He also revealed that a ''Nostradamus'' tour was still being contemplated: "We were in Hollywood recently and met with some producers and agents, so there are a lot of things going on behind the scenes."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2010/06/04/rob-halford-back-to-the-future/ |title=Rob Halford: Back To The Future |first=Bryan |last=Reesman |date=4 June 2010 |publisher=Attention Deficit Delirium |access-date=29 June 2010}}</ref>

=== Upcoming twentieth studio album (2024–present) ===
In a February 2024 interview with Audio Ink Radio, guitarist [[Richie Faulkner]] was asked if Judas Priest had "many more albums left" in them. His reply was, "I know personally, whenever we kind of put the writing sessions to bed and we finish the writing and everything, I always feel spent. I'm out of ideas. I've got nothing left, I've given everything to it. Where the hell am I gonna get more ideas from if we choose to do another record? But somehow they always, over the next couple of years, you start banking new riffs and melodies and stuff, and somehow you get a new ones. So you never know what the future holds."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/will-judas-priest-make-any-more-albums-after-invincible-shield-richie-faulkner-responds|title=Will Judas Priest Make Any More Albums After 'Invincible Shield'?

In an October 2024 interview with [[KBUE#KNAC|KNAC.com]], Faulkner was asked if Judas Priest were going to continue touring in 2025 or planning to hit the studio to write and record another album. His reply was, "I think a bit of both, really. These tours tend to grow and evolve over time — the more we do, we get more offers from different territories and stuff — so I'm sure there'll be more touring. And there's always ideas coming up, there's always creative juices flowing. So if we're able, we might be able to get in and put some ideas together and see where we are. Is there another record? I know we've got ideas coming up all the time — riffs and melodies and song ideas and stuff. We're creative people — as a group of creative people, that's gonna happen. So I think, hopefully if we get some time early next year, we'll be able to pool those ideas and see what we've got and then hopefully hit the road again somewhere else."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blabbermouth.net/news/richie-faulkner-weve-got-ideas-coming-up-all-the-time-for-new-judas-priest-music|title=Richie Faulkner: 'We've Got Ideas Coming Up All The Time' For New Judas Priest Music|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=3 November 2024|access-date=3 November 2024}}</ref>

== Artistry ==
=== Musical style and influences ===
Judas Priest's style has always been rooted in heavy metal, and many of their albums reflect diverse aspects of the genre. Their debut album, ''[[Rocka Rolla]]'' (1974), is primarily rooted in heavy [[blues rock]]. According to Tim Hall of ''[[The Guardian]]'', "The early Judas Priest albums contained an eclectic mix of styles. Out-and-out rockers sat alongside acoustic ballads, the odd quirky cover and ambitious multi-part epics that owed as much to [[Queen (band)|Queen]] as to [[Black Sabbath]]."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/nov/30/judas-priest-10-of-the-best-rob-halford | title=Judas Priest – 10 of the best | work=The Guardian | first=Tim | last=Hall | date=30 November 2016 | access-date=4 September 2025}}</ref>

From their second album, ''[[Sad Wings of Destiny]]'' (1976), through to their fourth, ''[[Stained Class]]'' (1978), the band's style was somewhat [[progressive music|progressive]], with complex guitar passages and poetic lyrics. Songs would often shift in dynamics and tempo, and the music was some of the heaviest of its day. ''[[Sin After Sin]]'' (1977) used a combination of [[double bass drum]] (or "double kick") and rapid 16th-note bass rhythms combined with rapid 16th-note guitar rhythms used by Black Sabbath, [[Venom (band)|Venom]], and [[Motörhead]] that came to define the genre.<ref name=Cope>{{cite book|author=Andrew Laurence Cope|title=Black Sabbath and the Rise of Heavy Metal Music|date=28 January 2013|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-4094-9398-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ft-hAgAAQBAJ&q=Dissident%20Aggressor&pg=PT139}}</ref> While the double-bass rhythms used by Judas Priest are generally measured and technical, the song "[[Dissident Aggressor]]" (from ''Sin After Sin'') pushed an increase in "tempo and aggression", which was later adopted by other bands with a much harder-edged approach.<ref name=Cope />

Starting with their fifth album, ''[[Killing Machine]]'' (1978), the band began to incorporate a more commercial, radio-friendly style to their music. ''[[British Steel (album)|British Steel]]'' (1980) has been referred to as the "record that, more than any other, codified what we mean by heavy metal".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilkinson |first=Roy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/20/judas-priest-rob-halford-british-steel |title=How Judas Priest invented heavy metal |work=The Guardian |date=20 May 2010 |access-date=10 August 2014}}</ref> The lyrics and music were simplified, and this style prevailed up to their seventh album, ''[[Point of Entry]]'' (1981). With their eighth album, ''[[Screaming for Vengeance]]'' (1982), the band incorporated a balance of these two styles. This continued on ''[[Defenders of the Faith]]'' (1984). With the follow-up album, ''[[Turbo (Judas Priest album)|Turbo]]'' (1986), the band incorporated guitar synthesizers into its signature heavy metal sound. On ''[[Ram It Down]]'' (1988), the band retained some of the more commercial qualities of ''Turbo'' but also returned to some of the fast tempo heavy metal found on their earlier works. This fast-tempo style continued with ''[[Painkiller (Judas Priest album)|Painkiller]]'' (1990). ''[[Jugulator]]'' (1997) tried to incorporate some of the 1990s contemporary [[groove metal]] styles. ''[[Demolition (Judas Priest album)|Demolition]]'' (2001) has a more traditional heavy metal sound with [[nu metal]] elements. Following the return of Halford for ''[[Angel of Retribution]]'' and ''[[Nostradamus (album)|Nostradamus]]'', the band returned to the style of its early albums.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Judas Priest {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/judas-priest-mn0000246611/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

Halford listened to and was influenced by [[Little Richard]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Robert Plant]] as a vocalist. He learned to push to the limits of his vocal abilities by their vocal demonstrations on record.<ref name="mastropolo">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2014/08/05/judas-priest-interview-redeemer-of-souls-rob-halford-tipton-faulkner-spinal-tap/#sthash.l0w4o4nf.YhqbnrCM.dpbs|title=Four Decades of Hellfire with Judas Priest (Interview) – Rock Cellar Magazine|date=5 August 2014|website=Rockcellarmagazine.com|first=Frank|last=Mastropolo|access-date=22 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221154255/http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2014/08/05/judas-priest-interview-redeemer-of-souls-rob-halford-tipton-faulkner-spinal-tap/#sthash.l0w4o4nf.YhqbnrCM.dpbs|archive-date=21 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> He developed a powerful, operatic vocal style with an impressive range from lower throaty growls to ear-piercing high screams with strong [[vibrato]]. He was also a fan of [[Freddie Mercury]], referring to him as his ultimate hero.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/20/judas-priest-rob-halford-british-steel|title=How Judas Priest invented heavy metal|first=Roy|last=Wilkinson|date=20 May 2010|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Fashion ===
In addition to the sound, Judas Priest are also known for being revolutionary in [[heavy metal fashion]].<ref name="Bukszpan" /> In the band's early years, they dressed in hippie-style 1970s outfits, but as the decade drew to a close, the rise of punk rock made this look outdated, so the band began wearing simplified wardrobes on their 1978 tour. For the 1979 tour, Halford adopted his now-trademark leather-and-studs look, inspired by punk fashion and [[leather culture]]. The rest of the band adopted a similar style which became prominent at the time of their 1978 release, ''Killing Machine''. This style would go on to be adopted by many heavy metal bands in the early 1980s, especially those of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] and early [[black metal]] movements.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hell Bent for Leather/Killing Machine Info Page| publisher=Judas Priest Info Pages |url=http://members.firstinter.net/markster/KILLINGMACHINE.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702171452/http://members.firstinter.net/markster/KILLINGMACHINE.html |archive-date=2 July 2007}}</ref> To this day, it is not uncommon to find metal artists and fans sporting such a look at concerts.

In a published quote on the back cover of [[K. K. Downing]]'s autobiography ''Heavy Duty: Days and Nights in Judas Priest'', Downing said that Judas Priest "had a bit of an identity crisis from the beginning. There was always a bit of a question mark about the band's look. To me, it never seemed to say anything—and in the earliest days of our career, I suppose I actually saw that as a good thing."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/k-k-downing-i-think-judas-priest-had-a-bit-of-an-identity-crisis-from-the-beginning/|title=K.K. DOWNING: 'I Think JUDAS PRIEST Had A Bit Of An Identity Crisis From The Beginning'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=16 July 2018}}</ref>

Downing said he was the one who came up with the band's black-leather look back when he first started in the music business: "I had this Heavy Metal attitude inside of me. I had it all of my life. When I got into Judas Priest I knew I had a band that had a great name. I knew we were a great band ... but something was not quite complete. The leather and studs image came along and it all started to complete itself. We had the album cover with the razor blade ... and Heavy Metal was born, mate. I was a youngster and it came to me. Around 1976 is when it happened. The band took to it and got on with it, really."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classicrockrevisited.com/show_interview.php?id=1284|author=Wright, Jeb|title=K.K. Downing – Wild Nights & Lots of Words!|publisher=classicrockrevisited.com}}</ref>

Although Halford adopted the gay leather fetish wear for the band's look, he stated that he "had no interest in [[S&M]], [[Dominance and submission|domination]] or the whole [[queer]] subcult of leather and chains" because he is a [[Conventional sex|vanilla]] gay man. He feels that fans of the era also did not suspect a homosexual or [[Kink (sexuality)|kink]] subtext in the leather-and-studs look.<ref>{{cite web |website=Rock and Roll Garage |title=Rob Halford recalls why Judas Priest started using leather |first=Rafael |last=Polcaro |date=December 10, 2020 |url=https://rockandrollgarage.com/rob-halford-recalls-why-judas-priest-started-using-leather/ }}</ref> After Halford's [[coming out]] as gay, modern listeners often identify Judas Priest as having queer themes in their lyrics and fashion.<ref>{{cite web |date=August 6, 2019 |website=Kerrang |first=Sam |last=Moore |title=We Need To Talk About The Queerness Of Judas Priest|url=https://www.kerrang.com/we-need-to-talk-about-the-queerness-of-judas-priest }}</ref>

== Legacy and influence==
Judas Priest have influenced a great deal of metal music since the late 1970s. The band's popularity and status as one of the exemplary and influential heavy metal bands has earned them the nickname "Metal Gods" from their [[Metal Gods|song of the same name]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Berelian |first=Essi |title=The Rough Guide to Heavy Metal |year=2005 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn= 1-84353-415-0 |page=172}}</ref> They were ranked by [[MTV]] as the second "Greatest Metal Band" of all time (after [[Black Sabbath]]), and [[VH1]] named them the 78th greatest artist of all time in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |work=MTVNews.com |title=The Greatest Metal Bands Of All Time – 2.

==Awards, nominations, and critical reception==
Despite their huge, loyal fanbase, Judas Priest have never been well-received by much of the music press, partially because their late 1970s rise coincided with the [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] movements, which occupied much of the music press's attention at the time. The first edition of ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' gave their first three albums one star each and described the band as "for lovers of stolen [[Led Zeppelin]] riffs only". The second edition of the guide a few years later also panned their entire discography. ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] was notably disdainful of the band, refusing to outright review any of their albums and relegating them to his "Meltdown" list (referring to artists he did not consider having any material worth listening to). In 2018, they were nominated for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], but not inducted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/judas-priests-rob-halford-on-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-we-just-want-to-see-some-more-metal-in-there/|title=JUDAS PRIEST's ROB HALFORD On ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME: 'We Just Want To See Some More Metal In There'|date=25 March 2018}}</ref> In the same year, they were inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History at the [[Wacken Open Air|Wacken festival]]. Founder/CEO Pat Gesualdo thanked them "for the decades of hard work and dedication to heavy metal, an art form they helped establish." The band then stated that their induction "also sends a great message of inclusion for the metal community around the world, and keeps us defending the metal faith together."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/video-judas-priest-inducted-into-hall-of-heavy-metal-history-at-germanys-wacken-open-air-festival/|title=Video: JUDAS PRIEST Inducted Into 'Hall Of Heavy Metal History' At Germany's WACKEN OPEN AIR Festival|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=6 August 2018}}</ref> In 2022, the band was finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as the recipients of the committee-selected "Award for Musical Excellence".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/judas-priest-0|title=Rock Hall 2022 Nominee : Judas Priest|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220203065632/https://www.rockhall.com/judas-priest-0 |access-date=14 July 2024|archive-date=3 February 2022 }}</ref> Despite this, many outlets, including [[MetalSucks]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2022/05/04/judas-priest-arent-among-the-2022-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-inductees-but-will-receive-the-musical-excellence-award/ |title=Judas Priest Won't Get Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but Will Receive the 'Musical Excellence Award'|website=Metalsucks.net |date=4 May 2022}}</ref> and ''[[Loudwire]]'',<ref name="loudwire.com">{{cite web |url=https://loudwire.com/judas-priest-rock-hall-of-fame-musical-excellence-award/ |title=Opinion: Rock Hall Inducting Judas Priest for 'Musical Excellence' is Actually a Backhanded Compliment |website=[[Loudwire]]|date=4 May 2022 }}</ref> were critical of the band being inducted via the "Award for Musical Excellence" rather than in the "Performer" category.

== In popular culture ==
The American director [[Rob Reiner]] went to see Judas Priest in concert as part of his preparation for making the film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984), which spoofs British heavy metal bands.<ref name="mastropolo" />

The drama-comedy film ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'' (2001), starring [[Mark Wahlberg]], is loosely based on the story of how Tim "Ripper" Owens replaced Rob Halford as the vocalist in Judas Priest.

On 5 January 2014, the band appeared in the episode "[[Steal This Episode]]" of comedy cartoon show ''[[The Simpsons]]'' playing a parody of their song "[[Breaking the Law]]". Their music was referred to as "[[death metal]]",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/14/simpsons-apologise-judas-priest-death-metal|date=14 January 2014|access-date=27 January 2014|first=Ben|last=Beaumont-Thomas|title=The Simpsons apologise to Judas Priest for calling them 'death metal'|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> for which the producers subsequently apologised by having [[Bart Simpson]] write "Judas Priest is not 'Death Metal{{'"}} in the opening sequence [[chalkboard gag]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/bart-simpson-apologizes-for-calling-judas-priest-death-metal-99510/ |title=Bart Simpson Apologizes for Calling Judas Priest 'Death Metal' |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=13 January 2014 |access-date=7 December 2019}}</ref>

In 2025, a voice over recording made by [[Toronto|Toronto's]] WILDsound Film Festival contained a quietly read set of unknown song lyrics directly written for [[Rob Halford]] and Judas Priest titled "Dark Elder".<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.wildsound.ca/videos/dark-elder|title=Poetry Reading: Dark Elder|publisher=WILDsound|date=23 July 2025|access-date=18 August 2025}}</ref>
