'''Europe''' is a Swedish [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Upplands Väsby]] in 1979,<ref name="dn.se">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dn.se/arkiv/teater/hardrock-tog-priset-enkopingsband-vann-rock-sm/|title=Hårdrock tog priset. Enköpingsband vann rock-SM|date=27 April 1993|website=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|access-date=11 November 2019}}</ref> by lead vocalist [[Joey Tempest]], guitarist [[John Norum]], bassist Peter Olsson, and drummer [[Tony Reno]]. They obtained a major breakthrough in Sweden in 1982 by winning the televised competition Rock-SM (Swedish Rock Championships); it was the first time this competition was held, and Europe became a larger success than the competition itself.

Since their formation, Europe has released eleven studio albums, three live albums, three compilations and twenty-four music videos. Europe's current lineup comprises Tempest, Norum, bassist [[John Levén]], keyboardist [[Mic Michaeli]], and drummer [[Ian Haugland]].

Europe rose to international fame in the 1980s with their third album, 1986's ''[[The Final Countdown (album)|The Final Countdown]]''. {{as of|2003}}, Europe had sold 10 million albums worldwide.<ref name="BBC News October 3, 2003">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3162506.stm | title=Rock group Europe plan comeback |work=BBC News |access-date=12 August 2008 | date=3 October 2003}}</ref> The band has had two top 20 albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart (''The Final Countdown''  and ''[[Out of This World (Europe album)|Out of This World]]'')<ref name="US">{{cite magazine |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=europe|chart=all}} | title=Billboard.com - Artist Chart History - Europe |magazine=Billboard.com |access-date=24 June 2008}}</ref> and three top 30 singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart ("[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]", "[[Rock the Night (song)|Rock the Night]]" and "[[Carrie (Europe song)|Carrie]]", which reached number 3 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100).<ref name="US S">{{cite magazine |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=europe|chart=all}} |title=Billboard.com - Artist Chart History - Europe |magazine=Billboard.com |access-date=24 June 2008}}</ref>

Europe went on hiatus in 1992, reunited temporarily for a one-off performance in [[Stockholm]] on New Year's Eve 1999 and announced an official reunion in 2003. Since then the band has released six albums, ''[[Start from the Dark]]'' (2004), ''[[Secret Society (album)|Secret Society]]'' (2006), ''[[Last Look at Eden]]'' (2009), ''[[Bag of Bones (album)|Bag of Bones]]'' (2012), ''[[War of Kings (album)|War of Kings]]'' (2015) and ''[[Walk the Earth]]'' (2017).

Europe gained new attention in the US after being featured in a [[GEICO]] cable television commercial campaign during 2015–2016.

== History ==
=== ''Europe'' and ''Wings of Tomorrow'' (1979–1984) ===
The first incarnation of the band was named ''Force'' and came together in 1979, in [[Upplands Väsby]], [[Stockholm]], and was integrated by vocalist [[Joey Tempest]], guitarist [[John Norum]], bass guitarist Peter Olsson, and drummer [[Tony Reno]].<ref name="1982-1992 booklet">{{cite AV media notes |title=1982-1992 |title-link=1982–1992 (Europe album) |others=Europe |year=1993 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Epic Records |id=EPC 473589-1 }}</ref> "I remember when we started the band Force we were playing covers in the rehearsal room, because we just wanted to learn our instruments, like all bands," Tempest said, "Then one day I said maybe we should do our own stuff. Nobody had any ideas, so I brought mine into the rehearsal room, and that is when we started writing our own stuff."<ref name="fireworks-26">{{cite web |url=http://www.rathole.com/fireworks/26/1.asp |title=Fireworks Magazine: Issue 26 |access-date=23 December 2007 |work=Rathole.com |archive-date=2 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202231627/http://www.rathole.com/fireworks/26/1.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The band sent several [[Demo (music)|demo]]s to [[record label|record companies]], but were told that in order to be published they had to cut their hair and sing in Swedish. Two years later, Olsson left the band and was replaced by [[John Levén]].<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/> Just a couple of months later, Levén joined [[Yngwie Malmsteen|Yngwie Malmsteen's]] band Rising Force, and Malmsteen's former bassist, [[Marcel Jacob]], joined Force. This only lasted for three months, though; Levén apparently had issues with Malmsteen, so he and Jacob traded places again.<ref name="rockdrömmen">{{cite book |last= Tengner |first= Anders |author2=Michael Johansson |title= Europe - den stora rockdrömmen |publisher= Wiken |language= sv |year= 1987 |isbn= 91-7024-408-1 }}</ref>

[[File:Joey Tempest by Enrico Dal Boni.jpg|right|thumbnail|Singer [[Joey Tempest]] performing in 2010.]]

In 1982, Tempest's girlfriend entered Force in the Swedish rock talent contest ''Rock-SM''. Competing against 4000 bands, they won the contest thanks to two songs, "In the Future to Come" and "The King Will Return". The reward was a record deal with ''Hot Records''. Tempest won the individual award for ''Best Lead Singer'', and Norum won the award for ''Best Guitarist''.<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/> Just before the contest, Force changed their name to Europe. Tempest got the name from the ''[[Made in Europe]]'' album by Deep Purple.<ref name="foxnews.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/for-legendary-metal-band-europe-the-final-countdown-goes-on-forever/ |title=For legendary metal band Europe, 'The Final Countdown' goes on forever |publisher=Fox News |date=25 November 2015 |access-date=24 January 2016 |archive-date=31 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131011912/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/11/25/for-legendary-metal-band-europe-final-countdown-goes-on-forever/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Europe (Europe album)|self-titled debut album]] was released the following year, and sold well both in Sweden and Japan. The album charted at number 8 in the band's home country and the single "[[Seven Doors Hotel]]" became a Top 10 hit in Japan.<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/>

The second album ''[[Wings of Tomorrow]]'' was released one year later. The album got interest from [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] who offered them an international contract in 1985.<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/> "I think one of the most important albums for the band was ''Wings of Tomorrow''," Tempest said, "We were learning how to write songs and John started playing some really cool stuff on the guitar.

Bassist Peter Olsson also claims that Reno was replaced on the albums by a drum machine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloggar.aftonbladet.se/hardrocksbloggen/tag/europe/ |title=europe &#124; Hårdrocksbloggen |website=Bloggar.aftonbladet.se |access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref> His replacement was [[Ian Haugland]].<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/>

=== ''The Final Countdown'' (1985–1987) ===
In 1985 Europe recorded the [[soundtrack]] for the film ''[[On the Loose (1985 film)|On the Loose]]'', which gave them the hit "[[Rock the Night (song)|Rock the Night]]".<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/> Several months later Joey Tempest was asked to write a song for the charity project [[:sv:Swedish Metal Aid|Swedish Metal Aid]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Rodrigo Silva|title=Swedish Metal Aid - Give A Helpin' Hand (Nöjesmassakern 11th Oct. 1985) HD|date=22 July 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ezf6rjtYE| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211113/k9ezf6rjtYE| archive-date=2021-11-13 | url-status=live|access-date=25 October 2018}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He wrote "Give a Helping Hand", which would feature the biggest stars of Swedish rock and metal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fromans.tumblr.com/post/51086122094/great-moments-in-hair-metal-history-swedish-metal|title=Great moments in hair metal history: SWEDISH METAL AID|website=Fromans|language=en|access-date=25 October 2018}}</ref> The income from the sales of the single, which was produced by [[Easy Action (band)|Easy Action]] guitarist [[Kee Marcello]], was donated to the starving people of Ethiopia.<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/>

In September 1985, Europe was approached by an executive from Epic Records. They helped Europe start the recording of its next album with [[Journey (band)|Journey]] producer Kevin Elson. The result was ''[[The Final Countdown (album)|The Final Countdown]]''. Released on 26 May 1986, the album gave the band its international breakthrough, was certified Triple Platinum in the USA<ref name="riaa">{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Europe&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |title=RIAA - Gold and Platinum |access-date=23 February 2008 |work=RIAA.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908205333/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Europe&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |archive-date=8 September 2015  }}</ref> and reached number 8 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard 200 chart]].<ref name="US"/> The [[The Final Countdown (song)|title track]], which was based on a keyboard riff composed by Tempest as early as 1981–82,<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/> was released as the first single and became a worldwide success, peaking at number 1 in 25 countries,<ref name="BBC News October 3, 2003"/> such as the UK,<ref name="UK S">{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ |title=UK Album Chart |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |access-date=24 June 2008 }}</ref> France,<ref name="FRA S">{{cite web |url=http://lescharts.com/search.asp?search=Europe&cat=s |title=French Album Chart |publisher=lescharts.com |access-date=24 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804104248/http://lescharts.com/search.asp?search=Europe&cat=s |archive-date=4 August 2008  }}</ref> Spain, and Germany.<ref name="GER">{{cite web|url=http://www.charts-surfer.de/musiksearch.php |title=German Album Chart |publisher=charts-surfer |access-date=24 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029144156/http://charts-surfer.de/musiksearch.php |archive-date=29 October 2007 }}</ref> The hit "[[Rock the Night (song)|Rock the Night]]" was in the top 10 charts in European countries.

Not satisfied with the album's keyboard-dominated production nor the band's commercialized image, John Norum decided to leave Europe in October 1986 to pursue a solo career.<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/> "I didn't really like the direction the band was going in," Norum said, "We became this teeny-bopper, bubblegum band and I hated that whole image, the spandex, poodle-rock type of thing. I was more into the heavier, guitar-oriented stuff and it seemed like the keyboards were taking over more and more, and we were becoming more commercial. So I decided to leave.

Kee Marcello was asked to replace him, and after some consideration, he decided to join the band.<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/> Marcello joined the band at its commercial peak.

Three singles from ''[[The Final Countdown (album)|The Final Countdown]]'' reaching the US Top 30.<ref name="US S" /> The following year included successful tours through Europe and the USA.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

=== ''Out of This World'' and ''Prisoners in Paradise'' (1988–1992) ===
The follow-up to ''The Final Countdown'' was entitled ''[[Out of This World (Europe album)|Out of This World]]'' and was released in 1988. The biggest hit from the album was "[[Superstitious (song)|Superstitious]]" which peaked at number 31 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 9 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. "Superstitious" would be the last Europe song to chart in the USA.<ref name="US S" /> The album was certified platinum in the States and peaked at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart.<ref name="US" /><ref name="riaa"/> More touring followed, including an American tour with [[Def Leppard]] and a festival gig at the [[National Bowl]] in [[Milton Keynes]], England with [[Bon Jovi]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] and [[Vixen (band)|Vixen]].<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/>

[[File:Europe hamburg1994.jpg|right|thumbnail|Europe in Hamburg, 1992]]

In September 1989, Europe did a gig at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] club in [[West Hollywood, California]], under the [[pseudonym]] ''Le Baron Boys''.<ref name="Prisoners in Paradise booklet">{{cite AV media notes |title=Prisoners in Paradise |title-link=Prisoners in Paradise |others=Europe |year=2001 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Spitfire Records |id=5190-2 }}</ref> That name would later be used as a title for a much-circulated Europe [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]], which contained demo recordings from 1989 to 1990. Two years later, the album ''[[Prisoners in Paradise]]'' was released, but received limited media attention due to the "boom" of the [[grunge]] movement, started by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Alice In Chains]] and [[Pearl Jam]]. Although the sales were low compared to previous albums, the single "[[I'll Cry for You]]" managed to hit number 28 on the UK charts.<ref name="UK S"/> On [[New Year's Eve]] 1991, Europe kicked off a new tour with a show at the [[Tokyo Dome]], in which [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], [[Thunder (band)|Thunder]] and [[Metallica]] also performed.

After ten years of living, recording, and touring together, Europe decided to take a break at the end of the 1992 tour.<ref name="1982-1992 booklet"/> "I remember in the tour bus afterwards we were talking about where the whole thing was going and I think at the time the consensus of the band was we really felt ready for a break," Tempest said, "We felt that it was time to put some roots down and I was really into the idea of making my own solo album."<ref name="fireworks-18">{{cite web|url=http://www.rathole.com/fireworks/18/1.asp |title=Fireworks Magazine: Issue 18 |access-date=15 April 2008 |work=RATHOLE.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214221440/http://www.rathole.com/fireworks/18/1.asp |archive-date=14 December 2007  }}</ref> In that time, Tempest, Norum and Marcello released solo albums whilst the other members participated in several different projects and bands. In return, Europe was dropped from [[Epic Records]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

=== Reunion and ''Start from the Dark'' (2003–2005) ===
The band members started to discuss the possibility of a Europe reunion in 1998.<ref name="fireworks-18"/> "Mic and Ian came over to see me in Ireland," Tempest said, "Then whilst we were there, John Norum called from LA, and we were like 'Yes, maybe now is the right time to get things started again'."<ref name="fireworks-18"/> For the 2000 millennium celebrations, Europe was asked to do a concert in Stockholm on New Year's Eve 1999. That would be Europe's first and, to date, only concert with both of their lead guitarists, since both John Norum and Kee Marcello had accepted the offer to play that evening with the rest of the group. They played "Rock the Night" and "The Final Countdown".<ref name="fireworks-18"/><ref name="fireworks-17"/>

[[File:John Norum by Enrico Dal Boni.jpg|right|thumbnail|upright|Guitarist [[John Norum]] performing in 2009.]]

Over the years, there were several reunion rumors, and on 2 October 2003 it was made official: Europe announced plans for a new album and world tour.<ref name="Blabbermouth October 2, 2003">{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=15639 |title=It's Official: Europe to Record New Album, Embark On World Tour |access-date=24 July 2008 |work=roadrunnerrecords.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206014217/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=15639 |archive-date=6 December 2008  }}</ref> The band then switched back to ''The Final Countdown'' line-up, with John Norum as the only lead guitarist.<ref name="fireworks-18"/> "There was no doubt that we wanted John back, and John wanted to get back," Tempest said, "For me it was important to get that spark going again that we had before."<ref name="fireworks-26"/> Kee Marcello claimed that he was too busy with his own projects. "I told them I didn't want to participate in a [new] studio album because musically, I want to go in a different kind of direction than the music Europe stands for," Marcello said, "Then we talked for a while about doing a six-piece tour – it didn't turn out that way because of different reasons."<ref name="fireworks-17">{{cite web |url=http://www.rathole.com/fireworks/17/2.asp |title=Fireworks Magazine: Issue 17 |access-date=23 December 2007 |work=Rathole.com |archive-date=7 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107112146/http://www.rathole.com/fireworks/17/2.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The songwriting for a new album, ''[[Start from the Dark]]'', began early in 2003.<ref name="fireworks-18"/> "It was just a matter of moving forward and writing songs for the new album," Tempest said, "That was always our intention. We thought that if we were gonna make a comeback, we wanted to do it properly, and that meant we wanted to write and record some new songs, a new album."<ref name="fireworks-18"/> For the recording of ''Start from the Dark'', the band decided to work with producer Kevin Elson, who had also produced ''The Final Countdown''.<ref name="fireworks-18"/> "We could either go with a younger producer, or we could go with someone that we knew, someone experienced who is on the same wavelength as the band," Tempest said, "So in the end we decided that Kevin would be the perfect choice."<ref name="fireworks-18"/>

In the summer of 2004, Europe went on a festival tour through the European continent.<ref name="fireworks-18"/> The concert setlists included the old hits, but also introduced the title track from ''Start from the Dark''.<ref name="fireworks-18"/> The album was released on 22 September 2004, the same day that John Norum became a father. ''Start from the Dark'' featured a more modern sound compared to Europe's previous albums. "We wanted to be doing something at least that was a little bit relevant now; bit of a dry mix, detuned a bit," Tempest said, "So we felt like we didn't want to do an 1980s album per se, we just wanted to start like a fresh band really."<ref name="Blabbermouth July 10, 2005">{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=39083 |title=Europe Singer: 'We Have More Great Songs Than Just The Final Countdown' |access-date=25 July 2008 |work=roadrunnerrecords.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206014232/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=39083 |archive-date=6 December 2008  }}</ref> Eventually, the album sold in excess of 600,000 copies worldwide.<ref name="fireworks-26"/>

=== ''Secret Society'' and ''Last Look at Eden'' (2006–2010) ===
Europe released its seventh album, ''[[Secret Society (album)|Secret Society]]'' on 26 October 2006. "We think it's one of the strongest albums that Europe has ever done," Tempest said, "There is definitely some more melodic stuff on this one. ''Start from the Dark'' was very raw and made a statement, which is cool but for us it felt like a debut album in a way, so we wanted to branch out a bit on this one and take it to new levels."<ref name="fireworks-26"/>
