'''Led Zeppelin''' were <!-- This article is written in British English, which commonly treats collective nouns as plural. DO NOT change "WERE" to "WAS". --> an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1968. The band comprised vocalist [[Robert Plant]], guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], bassist-keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and drummer [[John Bonham]]. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound and drawing from influences including [[blues]] and [[folk music]], Led Zeppelin are cited as a progenitor of [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Among the [[list of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], they influenced the music industry, particularly in the development of [[album-oriented rock]] and [[stadium rock]].

Led Zeppelin evolved from a previous band, [[the Yardbirds]], and were originally named "the New Yardbirds". They signed a deal with [[Atlantic Records]] that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved all-but-unmatched commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]'', was a top-ten album in several countries and features such tracks as "[[Good Times Bad Times]]", "[[Dazed and Confused (Jake Holmes song)|Dazed and Confused]]" and "[[Communication Breakdown]]". ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' (1969), their first number-one album, includes "[[Whole Lotta Love]]" and "[[Ramble On]]". In 1970, they released ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' which opens with "[[Immigrant Song]]". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971), is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] in history, with 37 million copies sold. It includes "[[Black Dog (Led Zeppelin song)|Black Dog]]", "[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]" and "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock. ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'' (1973) includes "[[The Song Remains the Same (song)|The Song Remains the Same]]" and "[[The Rain Song]]". ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' (1975), a double album, features "[[Trampled Under Foot]]" and "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]".

Page composed most of Led Zeppelin's music, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones occasionally contributed keyboard-focused parts, particularly on the band's final album. The latter half of their career saw a series of [[Led Zeppelin concerts|record-breaking tours]] that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]'' (1976) and ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' (1979), declined in the late 1970s. After Bonham's death in 1980, the group disbanded. The three surviving members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off concerts, including the 2007 [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in London, with Bonham's son [[Jason Bonham]] on drums.

Led Zeppelin have sold an estimated 200 to 300&nbsp;million records worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with five of their albums certified [[RIAA certification#RIAA Diamond certifications|Diamond]] in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described them as "the heaviest band of all time", "the biggest band of the seventies", and "unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history".<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=2006 Rolling Stone Covers |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/2006-rolling-stone-covers-207609/led-zeppelin-rs-1006-august-10-2006-3-135624/ |access-date=14 February 2024 |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=14 December 2006 |archive-date=14 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240214133328/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/2006-rolling-stone-covers-207609/led-zeppelin-rs-1006-august-10-2006-3-135624/ |url-status=live }}</ref> They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995; the museum's biography states that they were "as influential" in the 1970s as [[the Beatles]] were in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Led Zeppelin Biography |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/led-zeppelin/bio/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628093543/http://rockhall.com/inductees/led-zeppelin/bio/ |archive-date=28 June 2011 |access-date=5 September 2010 |website=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Formation: 1966–1968 ===
[[File:Led Zeppelin logo.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|The band's logotype, used since 1973|alt=The name Led Zeppelin in irregular capitals in black and white]]

In 1966, London-based session guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] joined the blues-influenced rock band [[the Yardbirds]] to replace bassist [[Paul Samwell-Smith]]. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with [[Jeff Beck]]. Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds became a four-piece with Page as the sole guitarist. This new line-up recorded an album, ''[[Little Games]]'', in 1967, before embarking on a tour of the United States, during which they performed several songs which would later be part of Led Zeppelin's early repertoire, including covers of [[Johnny Burnette]]'s "[[Train Kept A-Rollin']]" and "[[Dazed and Confused (Jake Holmes song)|Dazed and Confused]]", a song originally written and recorded by [[Jake Holmes]].{{sfn|Yorke|1993|pp=56–59}} In early April 1968, the Yardbirds held a recording session at [[Columbia Records|Columbia Studios]] in New York City, recording a number of tracks including a Page-Relf composition initially titled "Knowing That I'm Losing You", which was eventually re-recorded by Led Zeppelin as "[[Tangerine (Led Zeppelin song)|Tangerine]]".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russo |first=Greg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIYDAAAACAAJ |title=Yardbirds: The Ultimate Rave-up |date=March 2001 |publisher=Crossfire Publications |isbn=978-0-9648157-8-0 |language=en |access-date=15 August 2023 |archive-date=27 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230927162936/https://books.google.com/books?id=sIYDAAAACAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=January to July .... and everything in between |url=https://yardbirds68.blogspot.com/2015/04/fillmore-days.html |access-date=1 August 2023 |website=January to July .... and everything in between |archive-date=1 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230801011823/https://yardbirds68.blogspot.com/2015/04/fillmore-days.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Yardbirds' 1968 tour proved to be exhausting for the band. Drummer [[Jim McCarty]] and vocalist [[Keith Relf]] aimed to embark in a more acoustic direction, forming a [[folk rock]] duo which would eventually evolve into the group [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Together Biography, Songs, & Albums |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/together-mn0000520166/biography |access-date=25 June 2023 |website=AllMusic |language=en |archive-date=25 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230625204405/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/together-mn0000520166/biography |url-status=live }}</ref> Page, on the other hand wanted to continue the heavier blues-based sound he had established with the Yardbirds. With the support of the Yardbirds' new manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], Page planned to form a [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] with Beck and himself on guitars, and [[The Who]]'s [[Keith Moon]] and [[John Entwistle]] on drums and bass, respectively.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=15–16}} Vocalists [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Steve Marriott]] were also considered for the project.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=13–15}} The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon had recorded a song together in 1966, "[[Beck's Bolero]]", in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]].{{sfn|Davis|1985|pp=28–29}}

The Yardbirds played their final gig on 7 July 1968 at [[University of Bedfordshire|Luton College of Technology]] in Bedfordshire.{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=1198}} They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so McCarty and Relf authorised Page and bassist [[Chris Dreja]] to use the Yardbirds' name to fulfill the band's obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was [[Terry Reid]], but Reid declined the offer and suggested [[Robert Plant]], a singer for the [[Band of Joy]] and Hobbstweedle.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=65}} Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer [[John Bonham]].{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} John Paul Jones enquired about the vacant position of bass guitarist, at the suggestion of his wife, after Dreja dropped out of the project to become a photographer.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=10}}{{refn|group=nb|Dreja would later take the photograph that appeared on the back of Led Zeppelin's debut album.{{sfn|Fyfe|2003|p=45}}}} Page had known Jones since they were both session musicians, and agreed to let him join as the final member.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=64}}

[[File:Hindenburg disaster.jpg|alt=A black and white photograph of an airship near a mooring mast exploding at its stern.|left|thumb|A 1937 photograph of the burning [[LZ 129 Hindenburg]] taken by news photographer Sam Shere, used on the cover of the band's debut album and extensively on later merchandise]]

In August 1968, the four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on [[Gerrard Street, London|Gerrard Street]] in London.{{sfn|Lewis|1994|p=3}} Page suggested that they attempt "[[Train Kept A-Rollin']]", originally a [[jump blues]] song popularised in a [[rockabilly]] version by [[Johnny Burnette]], which had been covered by the Yardbirds. "As soon as I heard John Bonham play", Jones recalled, "I knew this was going to be great&nbsp;... We locked together as a team immediately".{{sfn|Welch |Nicholls|2001|p=75}} Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the [[P. J. Proby]] album ''[[Three Week Hero]]''. The album's track "Jim's Blues", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=54}}

The band completed the [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|Scandinavian tour]] as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Club at the Egegård School (today Gladsaxe School) festive hall, [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]], Denmark, on 7 September 1968.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=54}} Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page covered the costs.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=51–52}} After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a [[cease and desist]] letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=72–73}} One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a "lead balloon", an idiom for being very unsuccessful or unpopular.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=36}} The group dropped the 'a' in ''lead'' at the suggestion of Peter Grant, so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it "leed".{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=57}} The word "balloon" was replaced by "[[zeppelin]]", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought "the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace" to Page's mind.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=36}}

Grant secured a $143,000 advance contract (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|143000|1968|r=-3}}}} today) from [[Atlantic Records]] in November 1968—at the time, the biggest deal of its kind for a new band.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=84}} Atlantic was a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s, it began to take an interest in British [[progressive rock]] acts. At the recommendation of British singer [[Dusty Springfield]], a friend of Jones who at the time was completing her first Atlantic album, ''[[Dusty in Memphis]]'', record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them.{{sfn|Fortnam|2008|p=43}} Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.{{sfn|Lewis|1994|p=3}}

=== Early years: 1968–1970 ===
Still billed as the New Yardbirds, the band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, when they played at the [[Mayfair Ballroom]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bath |first1=Jo |last2=Stevenson |first2=Richard F. |date=2013 |title=The Newcastle Book of Days |location=Stroud |publisher=The History Press |isbn=9780752468662 |page=280}}</ref> Their first show as Led Zeppelin was at the [[University of Surrey]] in [[Guildford]] on 25 October.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Concert Timeline: October 25, 1968 |url=http://www.ledzeppelin.com/show/october-25-1968 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102222301/http://www.ledzeppelin.com/show/october-25-1968 |archive-date=2 January 2012 |access-date=3 November 2017 |website=Led Zeppelin.com|date=20 September 2007 }}</ref> Tour manager [[Richard Cole]], who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1968–1969|first North American tour]] at the end of the year.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=94}}{{refn|group=nb|The first show was in Denver on 26 December 1968, followed by other West Coast dates before the band travelled to California to play Los Angeles and San Francisco.{{sfn|Wall|2008||pp=92–93}}}} Their debut album, ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]'', was released in the US during the tour on 13 January 1969, and peaked at number 10 on the ''Billboard'' chart;<ref>{{Cite web |title=Led Zeppelin Billboard Albums |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/led-zeppelin-p4739/charts-awards |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906193322/http://allmusic.com/artist/led-zeppelin-p4739/charts-awards |archive-date=6 September 2011 |website=AllMusic}}</ref> it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=92, 147, 152}} According to [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Steve Erlewine]], the album's memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic blues]], groovy, [[Swing (jazz performance style)|bluesy shuffles]] and hints of [[Folk music of England|English folk music]] made it "a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal".{{sfn|Erlewine|2011b}}

[[File:Bron-y-aur - geograph.org.uk - 21107 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Bron-Yr-Aur]], near [[Machynlleth]], the Welsh cottage to which Page and Plant retired in 1970 to write many of the tracks that appeared on the band's third and fourth albums|alt=A colour photograph of a stone cottage on a hill]]

In their first year, Led Zeppelin completed four US and four UK [[concert tour]]s, and also released their second album, ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]''. Recorded mostly on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=161}} The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a sound that was "heavy and hard, brutal and direct", and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated.{{sfn|Erlewine|2010}} Steve Waksman has suggested that ''Led Zeppelin II'' was "the musical starting point for heavy metal".{{sfn|Waksman|2001|p=263}}

The band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of existing tracks for release as singles. Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where there were few radio and TV outlets for rock music. Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=166–167}} In 1969, an edited version of "[[Whole Lotta Love]]", a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the ''Billboard'' chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band's popularity.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=165}} The group also increasingly shunned television appearances, citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts.{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=49}}{{sfn|Wale|1973|p=11}}

Following the release of their second album, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} Some early [[Led Zeppelin concerts]] lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as [[Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings|bootleg recordings]]. It was during this period of intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.{{sfn|Wall|2008}}{{refn|group=nb|One alleged example of such extravagance was the shark episode said to have taken place at the [[The Edgewater (Seattle, Washington)|Edgewater Inn]] in [[Seattle]] on 28 July 1969.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=103}}{{sfn|Wall|2008}}}}

In 1970, Page and Plant retired to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], a remote cottage in [[Wales]], to commence work on their third album, ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=30 June 2010 |title=Led Zeppelin at Bron-Yr-Aur |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/history/pages/led-zeppelin-bron-yr-aur.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514164952/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/history/pages/led-zeppelin-bron-yr-aur.shtml |archive-date=14 May 2011 |access-date=16 September 2011 |website=BBC Wales Music}}</ref> The result was a more acoustic style that was strongly influenced by [[folk music|folk]] and [[Celtic music]], and showcased the band's versatility. The album's rich acoustic sound initially received mixed reactions, with critics and fans surprised at the turn from the primarily electric arrangements of the first two albums, further fuelling the band's hostility to the musical press.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=208–209}} It reached number one in the UK and US charts, but its stay would be the shortest of their first five albums.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=130}} The album's opening track, "[[Immigrant Song]]", was released as a US single in November 1970 against the band's wishes, reaching the top twenty on the ''Billboard'' chart.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=129}}

=== "The Biggest Band in the World": 1970–1975 ===
During the 1970s, Led Zeppelin reached new heights of commercial and critical success that made them one of the most influential groups of the era, eclipsing their earlier achievements.{{sfn|Waksman|2001|p=238}}{{sfn|Wall|2008}} The band's image also changed as the members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing, with Page taking the lead on the flamboyant appearance by wearing a glittering moon-and-stars outfit. Led Zeppelin changed their show by using things such as lasers, professional light shows and mirror balls.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=281}} They began travelling in a private jet airliner, a [[Boeing 720]] (nicknamed ''[[the Starship]]''), rented out entire sections of hotels (including the [[Andaz West Hollywood|Continental Hyatt House]] in Los Angeles, known colloquially as the "Riot House"), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House,{{sfn|Wall|2008a}} while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts|Hilton]], leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life.{{sfn|Williamson|2005|p=68}} Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. According to music journalist [[Chris Welch]], "[Led Zeppelin's] travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that [they] were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour".{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=47}}

[[File:Zoso.svg|thumb|Led Zeppelin's Four Symbols]]
Led Zeppelin released their [[Led Zeppelin IV|fourth album]] on 8 November 1971. The album is officially untitled but variously referred to as ''Led Zeppelin IV'', ''Untitled'', ''IV'', or, due to the four symbols appearing on the record label, as ''Four Symbols'', ''Zoso'' or ''Runes''.{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=25}} The band had wanted to release the fourth album with no title or information, in response to the music press "going on about Zeppelin being a hype", but the record company wanted something on the cover, so in discussions, it was agreed to have four symbols to represent both the four members of the band and that it was the fourth album.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=269–270}} With 37&nbsp;million copies sold, ''Led Zeppelin IV'' is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] in history, and its massive popularity cemented Led Zeppelin's status as superstars in the 1970s.{{sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=128}}{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=480}} By 2021, it had sold 24&nbsp;million copies in the United States alone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Led+Zeppelin&ti=Led+Zeppelin+iv&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum – RIAA<!-- Bot generated title --> |website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date=10 November 2021 |archive-date=10 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211110211204/https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Led+Zeppelin&ti=Led+Zeppelin+iv&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section |url-status=live }}</ref> The track "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", never released as a single, was the most requested and most played song on American rock radio in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Monitor |magazine=Broadcasting |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc. |date=12 November 1979 }}</ref> The group followed up the album's release with [[Led Zeppelin United Kingdom Tour Winter 1971|tours of the UK]], [[Led Zeppelin Australasian Tour 1972|Australasia]], [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1972|North America]], [[Led Zeppelin Japanese Tour 1972|Japan]], and [[Led Zeppelin United Kingdom Tour 1972–1973|the UK again]] from late 1971 through early 1973.

Led Zeppelin's next album, ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'', was released in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and [[mellotron]] orchestration. The predominantly orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group [[Hipgnosis]], depicts images of nude children climbing the [[Giant's Causeway]] in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial at the time of the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=290–291}}

''Houses of the Holy'' topped charts worldwide,{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=294}} and the band's subsequent [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1973|concert tour of North America in 1973]] broke records for attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At [[Tampa Stadium]] in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record set by [[The Beatles' 1965 US tour|the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert]] and grossing $309,000.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=194}} Three sold-out shows at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]'') was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|180000|1973|r=-3}}}} today) of the band's money from gate receipts was stolen from a safe deposit box at the [[Drake Hotel (New York City)|Drake Hotel]].{{sfn|Yorke|1993|pp=186–187}}

In 1974, Led Zeppelin took a break from touring and launched their own record label, [[Swan Song Records|Swan Song]], named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo is based on a drawing called ''Evening: Fall of Day'' (1869) by [[William Rimmer]]. The drawing features a figure of a winged human-like being interpreted as either [[Apollo]] or [[Icarus]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=<!--Not stated--> |title=William Rimmer Evening (The Fall of Day) |url=http://www.mfashop.org/wiriitfaofda.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190926230017/http://www.mfashop.org/wiriitfaofda.html |archive-date=26 September 2019 |access-date=26 September 2019 |website=Mfashop.org |publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=<!--Not stated--> |title=A History of the Led Zeppelin Icarus Logo |url=http://www.band-shirt.com/2013/03/09/history-of-the-led-zeppelin-icarus-logo/ |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190926224856/http://www.band-shirt.com/2013/03/09/history-of-the-led-zeppelin-icarus-logo/ |archive-date=26 September 2019 |access-date=26 September 2019 |website=Band-shirt.com}}</ref>{{sfn|Williamson|2007|p=107}} The logo can be found on Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as [[Bad Company]], [[the Pretty Things]] and [[Maggie Bell]].{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=191}} The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=312}}

In 1975, Led Zeppelin's double album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was their first release on the Swan Song label. It consisted of fifteen songs, of which eight had been recorded at [[Headley Grange]] in 1974 and seven had been recorded earlier. A review in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine referred to ''Physical Graffiti'' as Led Zeppelin's "bid for artistic respectability", adding that the only bands Led Zeppelin had to compete with for the title "The World's Best Rock Band" were [[the Rolling Stones]] and the Who.{{sfn|Miller|1975}} The album was a massive commercial and critical success. Shortly after the release of ''Physical Graffiti'', all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart,{{sfn|Davis|1985|pp=225, 277}} and the band embarked on another [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1975|North American tour]],{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=359}} now employing sophisticated sound and lighting systems.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=197}} In May 1975, Led Zeppelin played five sold-out nights at the [[Earls Court Arena]] in London, at the time the largest arena in Britain.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=359}}

=== Hiatus from touring and return: 1975–1977 ===
[[File:Jimmy Page with Robert Plant 2 - Led Zeppelin - 1977.jpg|thumb|Plant and Page performing at [[Chicago Stadium]] in Chicago on 10 April 1977, during Led Zeppelin's last North American tour|alt=A colour photograph of Robert Plant with microphone and Jimmy Page with a double necked guitar performing on stage.]]

Following their triumphant [[Earls Court 1975|Earls Court appearances]], Led Zeppelin took a holiday and planned an autumn tour in America, scheduled to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=35}} In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen were involved in a serious car crash while on holiday in [[Rhodes]], Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life.{{sfn|Davis|1985|pp=354–355}} Unable to tour, he headed to the [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] of [[Jersey]] to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in [[Malibu, California]]. During this forced hiatus, much of the material for their next album, ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]'', was written.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=364}}

By this time, Led Zeppelin were the world's number one rock attraction,{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=45}} having outsold most bands of the time, including the Rolling Stones.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=173}} ''Presence'', released in March 1976, marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] seller, ''Presence'' received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}}{{sfn|Davis|1976}} Page had been using heroin regularly since 1975 and relied on it during the rapid recording sessions for the album, a habit which affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although he has since denied this.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=364}}

[[File:Silverdome 2.jpg|thumb|left|The Pontiac [[Silverdome]], Michigan, where the band set a record for the largest solo indoor attraction in 1977 with an attendance of 76,229|alt=a colour photograph of a large domed stadium]]

Because of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, the band completed the concert film ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]'' and the accompanying [[The Song Remains the Same (album)|soundtrack album]]. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their [[tax exile]] status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection.{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|p=320}}

In 1977, Led Zeppelin embarked on another major [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|concert tour of North America]]. The band set another attendance record, with an audience of 76,229 at their [[Silverdome]] concert on 30 April.{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=229}} It was, according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]'', the largest attendance to that date for a single act show.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=49}} Although the tour was financially profitable, it was beset by off-stage problems. On 19 April, over 70 people were arrested as about 1,000 fans tried to gatecrash Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum for two sold-out concerts, while others tried to gain entry by throwing rocks and bottles through glass doors.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=392}} On 3 June, a concert at Tampa Stadium was cut short because of a severe thunderstorm, despite tickets indicating "Rain or Shine". A riot broke out, resulting in arrests and injuries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Concert Timeline: June 3, 1977 |url=http://ledzeppelin.com/show/june-3-1977 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407234121/http://www.ledzeppelin.com/show/june-3-1977 |archive-date=7 April 2011 |access-date=5 September 2010 |website=Led Zeppelin.com|date=22 September 2007 }}</ref>

After 23 July show at the [[Day on the Green]] festival at the [[Oakland Coliseum]] in [[Oakland, California]], Bonham and members of Led Zeppelin's support staff were arrested after a member of promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s staff was badly beaten during the band's performance by Zeppelin manager Peter Grant and one of his security goons, John Bindon.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=277}}{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=210}} The following day's second Oakland concert was the group's final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as they checked in at a [[French Quarter]] hotel for their 30 July performance at the [[Louisiana Superdome]], Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus. The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}}{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=85}}

=== Bonham's death and break-up: 1978–1980 ===
[[File:John Bonham 1975.jpg|thumb|upright|After the death of Bonham (pictured in July 1973) on 25 September 1980, the remaining members of Led Zeppelin decided to disband the group.|alt=A black and white photograph of John Bonham playing drums]]

In November 1978, the group recorded at [[Polar Studios]] in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'', featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=424}} Nevertheless, the album reached number one in the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album's release, Led Zeppelin's entire catalogue returned to the ''Billboard'' Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=80}}

In August 1979, after two warm-up shows in [[Copenhagen]], Led Zeppelin headlined [[Knebworth Festival 1979|two concerts]] at the [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth Music Festival]], playing to a crowd of approximately 104,000 on the first night.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=425}} A brief, low-key [[Tour Over Europe 1980|European tour]] was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in [[Nuremberg]], West Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=431–432}} Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.{{sfn|Davis|1985|p=300}}

[[Led Zeppelin – The 1980s, Part One|A North American tour]], the band's first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]].{{sfn|Welch|1994|p=92}} During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (from {{convert|16|to|24|usoz|abbr=on}}), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, "breakfast". He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's house—the Old Mill House in [[Clewer]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].

After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45&nbsp;pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was [[asphyxiation]] from vomit; the finding was accidental death.{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=92–94}}<ref name="srapdisbnds">{{Cite news |date=6 December 1980 |title=Rock group Led Zeppelin disbands |page=24 |work=Spokesman-Review |agency=Associated Press |location=(Spokane, WA, U.S.) |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=McopAAAAIBAJ&pg=7157%2C2314905 |url-status=live |access-date=26 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201210090253/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=McopAAAAIBAJ&pg=7157,2314905 |archive-date=10 December 2020}}</ref> An [[autopsy]] found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body.

The planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that [[Cozy Powell]], [[Carmine Appice]], [[Barriemore Barlow]], [[Simon Kirke]], [[Ric Lee]] or [[Bev Bevan]] would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, "We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were."<ref name="srapdisbnds" /> The statement was signed simply "Led Zeppelin".{{sfn|Welch|1994|pp=94–95}}

[[File:Jimmy Page 1983.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Page performs at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, California]] in 1983.|alt=A colour photograph of Jimmy Page performing on stage with a double-necked guitar]]

The studio album ''[[Coda (Led Zeppelin album)|Coda]]'' – a collection of Zeppelin outtakes and unused tracks – was issued in November 1982. It included two tracks from the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 1970, one each from the ''Led Zeppelin III'' and ''Houses of the Holy'' sessions, and three from the ''In Through the Out Door'' sessions. It also featured a 1976 Bonham drum instrumental with electronic effects added by Page, called "[[Bonzo's Montreux]]".{{sfn|Yorke|1993|p=267}}

The first significant post-breakup musical project by Led Zeppelin members was [[the Honeydrippers]], formed by Plant in 1981. The group featured Page on lead guitar along with studio musicians and friends of the pair, including Jeff Beck, [[Paul Shaffer]], and [[Nile Rodgers]]. It released one EP, in 1984. Plant focused on a different direction from Zeppelin, playing [[Standard (music)|standards]] and in a more [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] style, highlighted by a cover of "[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]]" that peaked at number three on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]] in early 1985.{{sfn|Huey|2011}}

[[File:Live Aid at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, PA.jpg|thumb|right|Page, Plant, and Jones performing at Live Aid in Philadelphia]]

On 13 July 1985, Page, Plant, and Jones reunited for the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium|JFK Stadium, Philadelphia]], playing a short set with drummers [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]] and [[Phil Collins]] and bassist [[Paul Martinez]]. Collins had contributed to Plant's first two solo albums; Martinez was a member of Plant's solo band. The performance was marred by a lack of rehearsal with the two drummers, Page's struggles with an out-of-tune guitar, poorly functioning monitors, and Plant's hoarse voice.{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=139}}{{sfn|Prato|2008}} Page described the performance as "pretty shambolic",<ref>{{Cite news |date=20 November 2007 |title=Jimmy Page says last Led Zeppelin reunion was a disaster |work=The List |url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/5700-jimmy-page-says-last-led-zeppelin-reunion-was-a-disaster/ |url-status=dead |access-date=29 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712163557/http://www.list.co.uk/article/5700-jimmy-page-says-last-led-zeppelin-reunion-was-a-disaster/ |archive-date=12 July 2014}}</ref> while Plant characterised it as an "atrocity".{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=139}}

The three members reunited again on 14 May 1988, for the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] concert, with Bonham's son [[Jason Bonham|Jason]] on drums. The result was again disjointed: Plant and Page had argued immediately before taking the stage about whether to play "Stairway to Heaven", and Jones' keyboards were absent from the live television feed.{{sfn|Prato|2008}}{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=140}} Page described the performance as "one big disappointment" and Plant said "the gig was foul".{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=140}}

The first [[Led Zeppelin Boxed Set|Led Zeppelin box set]], featuring tracks remastered under Page's supervision, was released in 1990 and bolstered the band's reputation, leading to abortive discussions among members about a reunion.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=457}} This set included four previously unreleased tracks, including a version of [[Robert Johnson]]'s "[[Travelling Riverside Blues]]".{{sfn|Erlewine|2011c}} The song peaked at number seven on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Album Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Artist Chart History&nbsp;– Led Zeppelin |url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.vnuArtistId=5047&model.vnuAlbumId=10333 |url-status=dead |magazine=Billboard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221050358/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&model.vnuArtistId=5047&model.vnuAlbumId=10333 |archive-date=21 February 2009}}</ref> ''[[Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2]]'' was released in 1993; the two box sets together contained all known studio recordings, as well as some rare live tracks.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011e}}

In 1994, [[Page and Plant]] reunited for a 90-minute "UnLedded" MTV project. They later released an album called ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'', which featured some reworked Led Zeppelin songs, and embarked on a world tour the following year. This is said to be the beginning of a rift between the band members, as Jones was not even told of the reunion.{{sfn|Murray|2004|p=75}}

In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the United States [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] of [[Aerosmith]]. Jason and Zoë Bonham also attended, representing their late father.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=163}} At the [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees|induction ceremony]], the band's inner rift became apparent when Jones joked upon accepting his award, "Thank you, my friends, for finally remembering my phone number", causing consternation and awkward looks from Page and Plant.{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|1997|p=144}} Afterwards, they played one brief set with Tyler and Perry, with Jason Bonham on drums, and then a second with [[Neil Young]], this time with [[Michael Lee (musician)|Michael Lee]] playing the drums.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=163}}

In 1997, Atlantic released a single edit of "Whole Lotta Love" in the US and the UK, the only single the band released in their homeland, where it peaked at number 21.{{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=166}} November 1997 saw the release of ''[[BBC Sessions (Led Zeppelin album)|Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions]]'', a two-disc set largely recorded in 1969 and 1971.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011f}} Page and Plant released another album called ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'' in 1998, featuring all new material, but after disappointing sales, the partnership dissolved before a planned Australian tour.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=460–461}}

[[File:John Bonham-2.jpg|thumb|John Bonham's aggressive drumming style was critical to the hard rock sound associated with the band.|alt=A black and white photograph of John Bonham wearing a headband and behind the cymbals of a drum kit]]Led Zeppelin's music was rooted in the [[blues]].{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} The influence of American blues artists such as [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Skip James]] was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct [[country blues]] style of [[Howlin' Wolf]].{{sfn|Gulla|2001|pp=153–159}} There were tracks structured around the [[twelve-bar blues]] on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically.{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=8}} The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the [[British folk revival|British]], [[Celtic music|Celtic]], and [[American folk music revival|American folk revivals]].{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} Scottish folk guitarist [[Bert Jansch]] helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted [[Guitar tunings#Open tunings|open tunings]] and aggressive strokes into his playing.{{sfn|Wall|2008|p=94}} The band also drew on a wide variety of genres, including [[world music]],{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} and elements of early [[rock and roll]], [[jazz]], [[country music|country]], [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[reggae]], particularly on ''Houses of the Holy'' and the albums that followed.{{sfn|Gulla|2001|pp=153–159}}

The material on the first two albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of [[List of blues standards|blues standards]]{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} and [[Folk music|folk songs]].{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=56–59}}{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=26}} Page recounted the process, saying "We didn’t over-rehearse things. We just had them so that they were just right, so that there was this tension – maybe there might be a mistake. But there won’t be, because this is how we’re all going to do it and it’s gonna work!"<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |last=Scaramangapublished |first=Jenna |date=2022-08-19 |title=The greatest guitar albums of the '70s: Getting the Led out with Sabbath, the Who, Pink Floyd and more |url=https://www.guitarworld.com/features/greatest-guitar-albums-of-the-70s |access-date=2025-03-17 |website=guitarworld |language=en}}</ref> This method led to musical and lyrical elements from different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, being mixed together to create new material—which would also lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=56–59}} Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song.{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=26}} From the visit to [[Bron-Yr-Aur]] in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=294–296 and 364–366}} In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard.

Early lyrics drew on the band's blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs.{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=25}} Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music.{{Sfn|Cope|2010|p=81}} Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as [[misogyny|misogynistic]].{{sfn|Cope|2010|p=81}} Particularly on ''Led Zeppelin III'', they incorporated elements of [[mythology]] and [[mysticism]] into their music,{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history.{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=59}} These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the [[occult]], which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in [[backmasking]]; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=278–279}} The pastoral fantasies in Plant's songwriting were inspired by the landscape of the [[Black Country]] region and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s high fantasy novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.{{sfn|Schinder |Schwartz|2008|p=383}} Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfn|Fast|2001|pp=9–10}} In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances.{{sfn|Wall|2008|pp=364–365}}

According to musicologist [[Robert Walser (musicologist)|Robert Walser]], "Led Zeppelin's sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant's wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page's heavily distorted crunch".{{sfn|Walser|1993|p=10}} These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the originators of [[hard rock]]{{sfn|Fast|2011|p=5}} and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]{{sfn|Walser|1993|p=10}}<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Led Zeppelin |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/led-zeppelin/biography |url-status=dead |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505012026/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/led-zeppelin/biography |archive-date=5 May 2011 |access-date=24 December 2009}}</ref> and they have been described as the "definitive heavy metal band",{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} although the band members have often eschewed the label.{{sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=124}} Led Zeppelin, together with [[Deep Purple]] and [[Black Sabbath]], have been referred to as the "unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid- seventies".{{sfn|McIver|2006|loc=Chapter 11, p. 1}} Part of this reputation depends on the band's use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like "Whole Lotta Love" and "[[The Wanton Song]]".{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=1198}}{{sfn|Fast|2001|pp=113–117}} Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations.{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=96}} Page's guitar playing incorporated elements of the [[blues scale]] with those of [[Music of Asia|eastern music]].{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=87}} Plant's use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to [[Janis Joplin]]'s vocal technique.{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=1198}}{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=45}} [[Robert Christgau]] found him integral to the group's heavy "power blues" aesthetic, functioning as a "mechanical effect" similarly to Page's guitar parts. While noting Plant "hints at real feeling" on some of their acoustic songs, Christgau believed he abandoned traditional blues singing's emphasis on emotional projection in favour of vocal precision and dynamics: "Whether he is mouthing sexist blues cliches or running through one of the band's half-audible, half-comprehensible ... lyrics about chivalry or the counter-culture, his voice is devoid of feeling. Like the tenors and baritones of yore, he wants his voice to be an instrument—specifically, an electric guitar."{{sfn|Christgau|1972a}} Bonham's drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum; while Jones' basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band's sound.{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=13}}{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=1198}}

{{quote box
| quote = At some deep level, Led Zeppelin's music is about the relationship between humanity and technology.

Led Zeppelin have been widely viewed as a hard rock band, although Christgau regarded them as [[art rock]] as well.{{sfn|Christgau|1980}} According to popular music scholar [[Reebee Garofalo]], "because hip critics could not find a constructive way of positioning themselves in relation to Led Zeppelin's ultra-macho presentation, they were excluded from the art rock category despite their broad range of influences."{{sfn|Garofalo|2008|p=233}} Christgau wrote in 1972, the band could be considered art rock because they "relate to rock and roll not organically but intellectually", idealising the "amplified beat" as "a kind of formal challenge". Unlike their contemporaries in [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] and [[Yes (band)|Yes]], who use "the physical compulsion of beat and volume to involve the mind", Led Zeppelin "make body music of an oddly cerebral cast, arousing aggression rather than sexuality." As such, along with other second-generation English hard rock bands like [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Mott the Hoople]], they can attract both intellectuals and working-class youths in "a strange potential double audience."{{sfn|Christgau|1972b}} Years later, ''In Through the Out Door''{{'}}s "tuneful synthesizer pomp" further confirmed for Christgau they were an art rock band.{{sfn|Christgau|1980}}

Page stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had "light and shade", and held the belief that instrumentation could be used to "set the scene."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rachel |first=Daniel |title=The Art of Noise: Conversations with Great Songwriters |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |year=2014 |publication-date=October 7, 2014 |pages=48}}</ref> This began to be more clearly realised beginning with ''Led Zeppelin III'', which made greater use of acoustic instruments.{{sfn|Erlewine|2011a}} This approach has been seen as exemplified in the fourth album, particularly on "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", which begins with acoustic guitar and recorder and ends with drums and heavy electric sounds.{{sfn|Schinder |Schwartz|2008|p=390}}{{sfn|Fast|2001|p=79}} Page was quoted saying, "The music is lyrical without lyrics. The lyrics are telling a story and they're conveying a situation or a person or a reflection or an observation, and the construction of the music I felt was doing the same sort of thing. It was lyrical in the way it was being played."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rachel |first=Daniel |title=The Art of Noise: Conversations with Great Songwriters |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |year=2014 |publication-date=October 7, 2014 |pages=55}}</ref> Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and [[progressive rock|progressive]] sound, dominated by Jones' keyboard motifs.{{sfn|Schinder |Schwartz|2008|pp=380–391}} They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and [[Overdubbing|overdubbed]] guitar parts.{{sfn|Gulla|2001|pp=153–159}} Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement{{sfn|Gulla|2001|pp=153–159}} has been seen as producing an individualistic style that transcends any single music genre.{{sfn|Brackett|2008|pp=53–76}}{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=585}} Ian Peddie argues that they were "...&nbsp;loud, powerful and often heavy, but their music was also humorous, self-reflective and extremely subtle".{{sfn|Peddie|2006|p=136}} Page stated that the band's albums were intended to be taken as a whole. He was quoted saying, "We were crafting albums for the album market. It was important, I felt, to have the flow and the rise and fall of the music and the contrast, so that each song would have more impact against the other."<ref name="auto"/>

Led Zeppelin influenced the [[music business]], particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and [[Arena rock|stadium rock]].{{sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=121}}{{sfn|Waksman|2009|pp=21–31}} In 1988, [[John Kalodner]], then-[[Geffen Records]] [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive, said, "Next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having [[Top 40]] hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody surpasses them."{{sfn|Pond|1988|pp=68–69}}
[[Andrew Loog Oldham]], the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, said Led Zeppelin influenced the record business and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences.{{sfn|Hughes|2010}} In 2007, they were a featured artist in the stadium rock episode of the BBC/VH1 series ''[[Seven Ages of Rock]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Seven Ages of Rock.

The band have sold over 200&nbsp;million albums worldwide, according to some sources,{{sfn|Thorpe|2007}}{{sfn|Beaumont|2020}} while others state that they have sold more than 300&nbsp;million records,{{sfn|Sorel-Cameron|2007}} including 111.5&nbsp;million certified units in the United States.

Led Zeppelin had cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of ''Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'', argues that "on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement".{{sfn|Straw|1990|p=84}} Led Zeppelin have also been described as "the quintessential purveyors"{{sfn|Waksman|2001|pp=238–239}} of masculine and aggressive "[[cock rock]]", although this assertion has been challenged.{{sfn|Fast|2001|pp=162–163}} The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at [[Christie's]] auction house, has commented that "Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people want a piece of that".{{sfn|Long|2007}} Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the [[big hair]] of the 1980s [[glam metal]] bands such as [[Mötley Crüe]] and [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]].{{sfn|Batchelor|Stoddart|2007|p=121}} Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of [[Kings of Leon]], shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of [[Jack White]] of [[the White Stripes]], and [[Kasabian]] guitarist [[Sergio Pizzorno]]'s silk scarves, [[trilby|trilbies]] and side-laced tight jeans.{{sfn|Long|2007}}
