'''Sir James Paul McCartney''' (born 18 June 1942) is an English musician.<!--NOTE: The lead sentence should stick to what he is primarily known for. The infobox is there to include additional occupations.--> He gained fame with [[the Beatles]], for whom he played bass guitar and the piano, and shared primary songwriting and lead vocal duties with [[John Lennon]]. McCartney is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing, versatile [[tenor]] vocal range and [[eclecticism in music|musical eclecticism]], exploring genres ranging from [[traditional pop|pre-rock and roll pop]] to classical, ballads and [[electronica]]. His [[Lennon–McCartney|songwriting partnership with Lennon]] is the most successful in music history.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Newman|first1=Jason|title=It Takes Two: 10 Songwriting Duos That Rocked Music History|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467781/it-takes-two-10-songwriting-duos-that-rocked-music-history|magazine=Billboard|access-date=5 October 2017|date=23 August 2011|quote=By any measure, no one comes close to matching the success of The Beatles' primary songwriters.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623105510/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467781/it-takes-two-10-songwriting-duos-that-rocked-music-history|archive-date=23 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Born in [[Liverpool]], McCartney taught himself piano, guitar and songwriting as a teenager, having been influenced by his father, a jazz player, and rock and roll performers such as [[Little Richard]] and [[Buddy Holly]]. He began his career when he joined Lennon's [[skiffle]] group, [[the Quarrymen]], in 1957, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called "the cute Beatle", McCartney later immersed himself in the London [[avant-garde]] scene and played a key role in incorporating [[experimental music|experimental]] aesthetics into the Beatles' [[recording practices of the Beatles|studio productions]]. Starting with the 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', he gradually became the band's ''de facto'' leader, providing creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. Many of his Beatles songs, including "[[And I Love Her]]", "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]", "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" and "[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]", rank among the most covered songs in history.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Elmes |first1=John |title=The 10 Most Covered Songs |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-10-most-covered-songs-1052165.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220525/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-10-most-covered-songs-1052165.html |archive-date=25 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=5 December 2008|access-date=8 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Conradt |first1=Stacy |title=10 of the Most Covered Songs in Music History |url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/20811/most-covered-songs-in-music-history |website=[[Mental Floss]] |date=30 November 2017 |access-date=17 December 2020 |archive-date=31 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201231213927/https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/20811/most-covered-songs-in-music-history |url-status=live }}</ref> Although primarily a bassist with the Beatles, he played a number of other instruments, including keyboards, guitars and drums, on various songs.

After the [[Break-up of the Beatles|Beatles disbanded]], he debuted as a solo artist with the 1970 album ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]'' and went on to form the band [[Paul McCartney and Wings|Wings]] with his first wife, [[Linda McCartney|Linda]], and [[Denny Laine]]. Under McCartney's leadership, Wings became one of the most successful bands of the 1970s. He wrote or co-wrote their US or UK number-one hits, such as "[[My Love (Paul McCartney and Wings song)|My Love]]", "[[Band on the Run (song)|Band on the Run]]", "[[Listen to What the Man Said]]", "[[Silly Love Songs]]" and "[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]". He resumed his solo career in 1980 and has been touring as a solo artist since 1989. Apart from Wings, his UK or US number-one hits include "[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]" (with Linda), "[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]", "[[Pipes of Peace (song)|Pipes of Peace]]", "[[Ebony and Ivory]]" (with [[Stevie Wonder]]) and "[[Say Say Say]]" (with [[Michael Jackson]]). Beyond music, he has been involved in projects to promote international charities related to [[animal rights]], [[seal hunting]], [[land mine]]s, vegetarianism, poverty and [[music education]].

McCartney is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], with estimated sales of 100{{nbsp}}million records. He has written or co-written a record 32 songs that have topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, he had sales of 25.5&nbsp;million [[RIAA certification|RIAA-certified]] units in the US. McCartney's honours include [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees#Performers|two inductions]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1999), an [[Academy Award]], a [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]], 19 [[Grammy Awards]], an appointment as a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1965 and an appointment as [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1997 for services to music.

James Paul McCartney was born on 18 June 1942 at Walton Hospital in the [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton]] area of [[Liverpool]], where his mother, Mary Patricia ([[Birth name#Maiden and married names|née]] Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James, was known as Jim.{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=5}} Both of his parents were of Irish descent.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=75}} McCartney has a younger brother, [[Mike McGear|Peter Michael]], and a younger stepsister, Ruth, born to Jim's second wife, Angie, during her first marriage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Jade|date=14 January 2013|title=Macca, me and my mum's marzipan butties – Beatles star Paul McCartney's stepmum on life just outside the spotlight|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/macca-mums-marzipan-butties---3324767|access-date=28 January 2022|website=Liverpool Echo|language=en|archive-date=28 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220128031350/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/macca-mums-marzipan-butties---3324767|url-status=live}}</ref> Paul and Michael were baptised in their mother's [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] faith, even though their father was a former [[Protestant]] who had turned agnostic.

Before the war, Jim had worked as a salesman for the cotton merchants A. Hannay and Co., having been promoted from his job as a sample boy in their warehouse; when the war broke out, Hannay's was shuttered, and Jim was employed as a lathe turner at [[D. Napier & Son|Napier]]'s defence engineering works, volunteering for the fire brigade at night.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlin|2009|pp=8–9}}.</ref> The growing family was rehoused at a flat in [[Knowsley, Merseyside|Knowsley]] in 1944 and then in a [[council housing]] development in [[Speke]] in 1946. After the war, Jim returned to his job at the cotton merchants with a reduced income. Mary's work as a visiting [[midwife]] was much more remunerative.<ref name="carlin2009-p11">{{Harvnb|Carlin|2009|p=11}}.</ref>

McCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School in [[Belle Vale, Liverpool|Belle Vale]] because of overcrowding at Stockton.<ref>{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=1}}: Transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School due to overcrowding at Stockton; {{harvnb|Carlin|2009|p=13}}: Transferred to Joseph Williams in 1949.</ref> In 1953, he was one of only three students out of 90 to pass the [[Eleven-Plus exam|11-Plus]] exam, meaning he could attend the [[Liverpool Institute High School for Boys|Liverpool Institute]], a [[grammar school]] rather than a [[secondary modern school]].<ref>For his attendance at Joseph Williams Junior School see: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8203923.stm|title=Beatle's schoolboy photo auction|work=BBC News|date=16 August 2009|access-date=13 June 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502022815/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8203923.stm|archive-date=2 May 2012}}; For McCartney passing the 11-plus exam see: {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=9}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|pp=1–2}}: (secondary source).</ref> In 1954, he met schoolmate [[George Harrison]] on the bus from his suburban home in Speke.

McCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an [[upright piano]] in the front room, encouraged his sons to be musical and advised McCartney to take piano lessons. However, McCartney preferred to [[Learning music by ear|learn by ear]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=22–23}}{{refn|group=nb|Jim McCartney's father Joe played an E-flat tuba.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=71}} McCartney's father also pointed out the bass parts in songs on the radio, and often took his sons to local [[brass band]] concerts.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=23–24}}}} When McCartney was 11, his father encouraged him to audition for the [[Liverpool Cathedral]] choir, but he was not accepted.

{{Main|The Quarrymen}}

At the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in [[Woolton]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=93}} The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and [[skiffle]], a type of [[popular music]] with [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] influences.<ref>{{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=95}}: "The Quarrymen played a spirited set of songs—half skiffle, half rock 'n roll".</ref> Soon afterwards, the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] on bass, in 1960.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=18}} By May 1960, the band had tried several names, including ''Johnny and the Moondogs'', ''Beatals'' and ''the Silver Beetles''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=18–22}} They adopted the name ''the Beatles'' in August 1960 and recruited drummer [[Pete Best]] shortly before a five-engagement residency in [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=17–25}}

He became their manager in January 1962.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=84–88}} [[Ringo Starr]] replaced Best in August, and the band had their first hit, "[[Love Me Do]]", in October, becoming popular [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|in the UK in 1963]], and [[The Beatles in the United States|in the US]] a year later.

In August 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]", featuring a [[string quartet]]. Included on the ''[[Help! (album)|Help!]]'' LP, the song was the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member.<ref>{{harvnb|Buk|1996|p=51}}: Their first recording that involved only a single band member; {{harvnb|Gould|2007|p=278}}: The group's first recorded use of classical music elements in their music.</ref> "Yesterday" became one of the most covered songs in popular music history.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=157–158}}: "Yesterday" as the most covered song in history.</ref> Later that year, during recording sessions for the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. [[Musicology|Musicologist]] [[Ian MacDonald]] wrote, "from [1965]&nbsp;... [McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and ''de facto'' musical director of the Beatles."{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=172}} Critics described ''Rubber Soul'' as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics.<ref>{{harvnb|Levy|2005|p=18}}: ''Rubber Soul'' is described by critics as an advancement of the band's music; {{harvnb|Brown|Gaines|2002|pp=181–82}}: As they explored facets of romance and philosophy in their lyrics.</ref> Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song "[[In My Life]]".<ref>{{Harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=169–170}}: "In My Life" as a highlight of the Beatles catalogue.; {{Harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=587}}: Both Lennon and McCartney have claimed lead authorship for "In My Life".</ref> McCartney said of the album, "we'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=197}} Recording engineer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]] stated that the ''Rubber Soul'' sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious&nbsp;... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky."{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=780}}

In 1966, the Beatles released the album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''.

The band gave their final commercial concert at the end of their [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|1966 US tour]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=230}} Later that year, McCartney completed his first musical project independent of the group—a [[film score]] for the UK production ''[[The Family Way (soundtrack)|The Family Way]]''.

Upon the end of the Beatles' performing career, McCartney sensed unease in the band and wanted them to maintain creative productivity. He pressed them to start a new project, which became ''[[Sgt.

Epstein's death in August 1967 created a void, which left the Beatles perplexed and concerned about their future.{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=247}} McCartney stepped in to fill that void and gradually became the ''de facto'' leader and business manager of the group that Lennon had once led.{{sfn|Benitez|2010|pp=8–9}} In his first creative suggestion after this change of leadership, McCartney proposed that the band move forward on their plans to produce a film for television, which was to become ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''.

John Lennon privately left the Beatles in September 1969, though agreed not to go public with the information to not jeopardise ongoing business negotiations.

In 1970, McCartney continued his musical career with his first solo release, ''[[McCartney (album)|McCartney]]'', a US number-one album.

Following the addition of guitarist [[Henry McCullough]], Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance in front of an audience of seven hundred at the [[University of Nottingham]].

McCartney ventured into [[orchestral music]] in 1991 when the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society]] commissioned a musical piece by him to celebrate its [[sesquicentennial]].

== Musicianship ==
McCartney is a largely self-taught musician, and his approach was described by musicologist [[Ian MacDonald]] as "by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored&nbsp;... [he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... [A] natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony."<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=12}}: Natural melodist, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=13}}: Perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears.</ref> McCartney likened his approach to "the primitive cave artists, who drew without training".{{sfn|Benitez|2010|p=134}}

McCartney's earliest musical influences include [[Elvis Presley]], [[Little Richard]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Carl Perkins]], and [[Chuck Berry]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2000a|pp=140–141}}: Chuck Berry; {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=420–425}}: Buddy Holly, {{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=727}}: Elvis Presley; {{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=33}}: Carl Perkins and Little Richard; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=41, 92, 97, 124}}: Presley, {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=131–133, 225, 538}}: Holly, {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=134, 374, 446, 752}}: Berry.</ref> When asked why the Beatles did not include Presley on the ''Sgt. Pepper'' cover, McCartney replied, "Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didn't put him on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer, he was Elvis the King."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=727}} McCartney stated that in his bassline for "[[I Saw Her Standing There]]", he quoted Berry's "[[I'm Talking About You]]".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=66–67}}: "According to McCartney, the bassline was taken from&nbsp;"...I'm Talking About You"; {{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=18}}: McCartney: "I'm not gonna tell you I wrote the thing when Chuck Berry's bass player did; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=94}}: McCartney: "I played exactly the same notes as he did and it fitted our number perfectly".</ref>

McCartney called Little Richard an idol, whose [[falsetto]] [[Vocal music|vocalisations]] inspired McCartney's own vocal technique.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=33}} McCartney said he wrote "[[I'm Down]]" as a vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=156}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=201}}: (primary source).</ref> In 1971, McCartney bought the publishing rights to Holly's catalogue, and in 1976, on the fortieth anniversary of Holly's birth, McCartney inaugurated the annual "Buddy Holly Week" in England.

{{quote box|quote= Paul is one of the most innovative bass players ... half the stuff that's going on now is directly ripped off from his Beatles period ...

During McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a [[Höfner 500/1]] bass, although from 1965, he favoured his [[Rickenbacker 4001]]S for recording. While typically using [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox amplifiers]], by 1967, he had also begun using a [[Fender Bassman]] for amplification.<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|pp=16–17}}: Höfner 500/1, {{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|pp=44–45}}: Rickenbacker 4001, {{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|pp=85–86, 92–93, 103, 116, 134, 140, 173, 175, 187, 211}}: Vox amplifiers; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=298}}: Fender Bassman.</ref> During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a [[Wal (bass)|Wal 5-String]], which he said made him play more thick-sounding [[bassline]]s, in contrast to the much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} He uses [[Mesa Boogie#Bass amps|Mesa Boogie]] bass amplifiers while performing live.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=19}}

MacDonald identified "[[She's a Woman]]" as the turning point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out ''Rubber Soul'' as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on "[[The Word (song)|The Word]]".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=133–134}}: "She's a Woman"; {{harvnb|Ingham|2009|p=299}}: "began to come into its own".</ref> Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's [[Groove (music)|groove]] on the track "a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument."<ref>{{harvnb|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=10, 44}}: ''Rubber Soul'' as the starting point for McCartney's bass improvement, {{harvnb|Bacon|Morgan|2006|p=98}}: "a high point in pop bass playing".</ref> MacDonald inferred the influence of [[James Brown]]'s "[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]" and [[Wilson Pickett]]'s "[[In the Midnight Hour]]", American [[Soul music|soul]] tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he "delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=178–180}}

Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]" as "an astonishing piece of playing&nbsp;... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass'&nbsp;... [choosing] the area of the neck&nbsp;... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove."{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=112–113}} MacDonald identified the influence of [[Indian classical music]] in "exotic [[melisma]]s in the bass part" on "Rain" and described the playing as "so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=196–198}} By contrast, he recognised McCartney's bass part on the Harrison-composed "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]" as creative but overly busy and "too fussily extemporised".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=349}} McCartney identified ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]".{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=45–46}}

McCartney primarily [[Flatpicking|flatpicks]] while playing acoustic guitar, though he also uses elements of [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]].{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include "Yesterday", "[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]", "[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]", "[[I Will]]", "[[Mother Nature's Son]]" and "[[Rocky Raccoon]]".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=157–158}}: "Yesterday", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=174–175}}: "I'm Looking Through You", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=175–176}}: "Michelle", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=291–292}}: "Blackbird", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=305–306}}: "Mother Nature's Son", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=308}}: "Rocky Raccoon", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=315}}: "I Will".</ref> McCartney singled out "Blackbird" as a personal favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: "I got my own little sort of cheating way of [fingerpicking] ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time&nbsp;... I was trying to emulate those [[Folk music|folk]] players."{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} He employed a similar technique for "[[Jenny Wren]]".{{sfn|Molenda|2005|p=79}} He played an [[Epiphone Texan]] on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a [[Martin HD-7|Martin D-28]].<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|pp=146–147, 152, 161, 164}}: Epiphone Texan; {{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|pp=215, 218, 222, 239}}: Martin D-28.</ref>

McCartney played lead guitar on several Beatles recordings, including what MacDonald described as a "fiercely angular slide guitar solo" on "[[Drive My Car (song)|Drive My Car]]", which McCartney played on an [[Epiphone Casino]]. McCartney said of the instrument: "if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this."<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=149}}: "If I had to pick one electric guitar"; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=166–167}}: "Drive My Car", "fiercely angular slide guitar solo".</ref> McCartney bought the Casino in 1964, on the knowledge that the guitar's hollow body would produce more feedback.

In addition to these guitars, McCartney is known to use and own a range of other electric guitars, usually favouring the [[Fender Esquire]] and its subsequent incarnation, the [[Fender Telecaster]], using the latter with a sunburst finish on Wings' tours in the 1970s. He also owns a rare [[Ampeg Dan Armstrong Plexi]] guitar, the only left handed one known to be in existence, which appeared in the Wings video for "[[Helen Wheels]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mixdownmag.com.au/features/columns/gear-rundown-paul-mccartney/|title=Gear Rundown: Paul McCartney|date=7 July 2017|access-date=26 November 2020|archive-date=4 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201204144929/https://mixdownmag.com.au/features/columns/gear-rundown-paul-mccartney/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

McCartney's vocals have crossed several [[music genre]]s throughout his career. On "[[Call Me Back Again]]", according to Benitez, "McCartney shines as a [[blues]]y solo vocalist", while MacDonald called "[[I'm Down]]" "a [[Rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] classic" that "illustrates McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility".<ref>{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=68}}: "Call Me Back Again"; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=156}}: "I'm Down".</ref> MacDonald described "Helter Skelter" as an early attempt at [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and "Hey Jude" as a "pop/rock hybrid", pointing out McCartney's "use of [[Gospel music|gospel]]-style [[melisma]]s" in the song and his "pseudo-[[Soul music|soul]] shrieking in the fade-out".<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=297–298}}: "Helter Skelter", {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=302–304}}: "Hey Jude".</ref> Benitez identified "[[Hope of Deliverance]]" and "[[Put It There]]" as examples of McCartney's folk music efforts while musicologist [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] considered "[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]" and "[[Honey Pie]]" attempts at [[vaudeville]].<ref>{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=128}}: "Put It There", {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=138}}: "Hope of Deliverance"; {{harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=112–113}}: "When I'm Sixty-Four", {{harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=189–190}}: "Honey Pie".</ref> MacDonald praised the "[[Swing music|swinging]] beat" of the Beatles' [[Twelve-bar blues|twenty-four bar blues]] song, "She's a Woman" as "the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date", with McCartney's voice "at the edge, squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment."{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=133–134}} MacDonald described "[[I've Got a Feeling]]" as a "raunchy, mid-tempo rocker" with a "robust and soulful" vocal performance and "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]" as "the last of [the Beatles'] up-tempo rockers", McCartney's "[[Belting (music)|belting]]" vocals among his best since "Drive My Car", recorded three years earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=309–310}}: "Back in the U.S.S.R"., {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=332}}: "I've Got a Feeling", a "raunchy, mid-tempo rocker" with a "robust and soulful" performance.</ref>

=== Tape loops ===
In the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]]'s flat in London, McCartney brought [[Magnetic tape|tapes]] he had compiled at then-girlfriend [[Jane Asher]]'s home. They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that [[Dick James]] made into a demo for him.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=217–218}} Heavily influenced by American [[avant-garde]] musician [[John Cage]], McCartney made [[tape loops]] by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a [[Brenell Engineering|Brenell]] [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape recorder]] and splicing the various loops. He referred to the finished product as "electronic symphonies".{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=219–220}} He reversed the tapes, sped them up, and slowed them down to create the desired effects, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" and "[[The Fool on the Hill]]".<ref>{{Harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=185–193}}: Tape loops used on "Tomorrow Never Knows"; {{Harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=138–139}}: Tape loops used on "The Fool on the Hill".</ref>

== Personal life ==
=== Creative outlets ===
While at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work. However, his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college.{{sfn|Carlin|2009|pp=44–45}} During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances. His first contact with the London [[avant-garde]] scene was through artist [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]], who introduced McCartney to art dealer [[Robert Fraser (art dealer)|Robert Fraser]].{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=307}} At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=243}} McCartney later purchased works by [[Magritte]], whose painting of an apple had inspired the [[Apple Records]] logo.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=256–267}} McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the [[Indica Gallery]] in Mason's Yard, London, which [[Barry Miles]] had co-founded and where Lennon first met [[Yoko Ono]]. Miles also co-founded ''[[International Times]]'', an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income. Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, ''[[Many Years from Now]]'' (1997).<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2000a|pp=549–550}}: Indica Gallery renovation and Lennon meeting Ono; {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=549–550}}: Miles as McCartney's official biographer; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=232, 237–238}}: Barry Miles and ''IT''.</ref>

McCartney became interested in painting after watching artist [[Willem de Kooning]] work in de Kooning's [[Long Island]] studio.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=84}} McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in [[Siegen]], Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, [[Andy Warhol]], and [[David Bowie]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=266}} Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art.{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=453}} In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the [[Arnolfini, Bristol|Arnolfini]] Gallery in Bristol, England.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/946175.stm|title=McCartney art makes UK debut|work=BBC News|date=29 September 2000|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030314052114/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/946175.stm|archive-date=14 March 2003}}</ref> In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted in his hometown of Liverpool.

McCartney signed his first recording contract, as a member of the Beatles, with [[Parlophone]] Records, an [[EMI]] subsidiary, in June 1962. In the United States, the Beatles recordings were distributed by EMI subsidiary [[Capitol Records]]. The Beatles re-signed with EMI for another nine years in 1967. After forming their own record label, [[Apple Records]], in 1968, the Beatles' recordings would be released through Apple although the masters were still owned by EMI.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350–351}} Following the break-up of the Beatles, McCartney's music continued to be released by Apple Records under the Beatles' 1967 recording contract with EMI which ran until 1976. Following the formal dissolution of the Beatles' partnership in 1975, McCartney re-signed with EMI worldwide and Capitol in the US, Canada and Japan, acquiring ownership of his solo catalogue from EMI as part of the deal. In 1979, McCartney signed with [[Columbia Records]] in the US and Canada—reportedly receiving the industry's most lucrative recording contract to date, while remaining with EMI for distribution throughout the rest of the world.{{sfn|McGee|2003|pp=125–126}} As part of the deal, CBS offered McCartney ownership of Frank Music, publisher of the catalogue of American songwriter [[Frank Loesser]].

In 1963, [[Dick James]] established [[Northern Songs]] to publish the songs of Lennon–McCartney.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=365}} McCartney initially owned 20% of Northern Songs, which became 15% after a public stock offering in 1965. In 1969, James sold a controlling interest in Northern Songs to [[Lew Grade]]'s [[Associated Television]] (ATV) after which McCartney and John Lennon sold their remaining shares although they remained under contract to ATV until 1973. In 1972, McCartney re-signed with ATV for seven years in a joint publishing agreement between ATV and [[MPL Communications|McCartney Music]]. Since 1979, MPL Communications has published McCartney's songs.

McCartney and [[Yoko Ono]] attempted to purchase the Northern Songs catalogue in 1981, but Grade declined their offer. Soon afterward, ATV Music's parent company, Associated Communications Corp., was acquired in a [[takeover]] by businessman [[Robert Holmes à Court]], who later sold ATV Music to [[Michael Jackson]] in 1985. McCartney has criticised Jackson's purchase and handling of Northern Songs over the years. In 1995, Jackson merged his catalogue with Sony for a reported £59,052,000 ($95&nbsp;million), establishing Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he retained half-ownership.<ref name="JacksonBailout">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/13/business/media/13music.html |title=Michael Jackson Bailout Said to Be Close |first1=Jeff |last1=Leeds |first2=Andrew Ross |last2=Sorkin |work=The New York Times |date=13 April 2006 |access-date=26 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918161053/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/13/business/media/13music.html?ex=1302580800&en=45bff2f7a4da68fe&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |archive-date=18 September 2011 }}</ref> Northern Songs was formally dissolved in 1995, and absorbed into the Sony/ATV catalogue.<ref name="Harry 2002 456–459">{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=456–459}}: McCartney was unhappy about Jackson's purchase and handling of Northern Songs; {{harvnb|Southall|Perry|2006|p=203}}: Northern Songs dissolved and absorbed into Sony/ATV.</ref> McCartney receives writers' royalties which together are {{frac|33|1|3}} per cent of total commercial proceeds in the US, and which vary elsewhere between 50 and 55 per cent.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=195}} Two of the Beatles' earliest songs—"[[Love Me Do]]" and "[[P.S.

=== Drugs ===
McCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' [[Hamburg]] days when they often used [[Preludin]] to maintain their energy while performing for long periods.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66–67}} [[Bob Dylan]] introduced them to [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting "very high" and "giggling uncontrollably".{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=186–189}} His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics "another kind of mind" in "[[Got to Get You into My Life]]" specifically as a reference to cannabis.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=182}}: Habitual marijuana use by McCartney and the Beatles; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=190}}: Marijuana references in Beatles songs.</ref> During the filming of ''[[Help!

Initially reluctant to try [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second "[[Psychedelic experience|acid trip]]" in March 1967 with Lennon after a ''Sgt. Pepper'' studio session.<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=379–380}}: First LSD "trip", {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=382}}: Second LSD "trip".</ref> He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring: "It opened my eyes&nbsp;... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society."{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=228}} McCartney made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in ''The Times'', which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=386–387}} In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney £1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for [[Cannabis cultivation|illegal cultivation]] and a £100 fine at [[Campbeltown Sheriff Court]].{{sfn|Badman|1999|p=110}}

As a result of his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973.<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=300–307}}: Drugs.</ref> Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975 in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately {{convert|8|oz|g}} of cannabis in his luggage. Years later, McCartney said, "I don't know what possessed me to just stick this bloody great bag of grass in my suitcase.

McCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dorothy "Dot" Rhone, whom he met at the [[The Casbah Coffee Club|Casbah club]] in 1959.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=163}} According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations. He often chose clothes and makeup for her, encouraging her to grow her blonde hair to simulate [[Brigitte Bardot]]'s hairstyle,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=69}} and at least once insisting she have her hair restyled, to disappointing effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=69}}: Encouraging Rhone to grow her hair long like Bardot; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=171}}: Rhone had her hair re-styled to disappointing effect.</ref> When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied [[Cynthia Lennon]] to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=239–240}} The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage.

==== Wives ====
===== Linda Eastman =====
[[File:Paul and Linda McCartney Wings Over America 1976 (cropped).jpg|thumb|With Linda Eastman in 1976]]
[[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]] was a music fan who once commented, "all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=585}} At times, she [[Truancy|skipped school]] to see artists such as [[Fabian Forte|Fabian]], [[Bobby Darin]] and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=585}} She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], the Grateful Dead, [[the Doors]] and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=587}} The pair first became properly acquainted on 15 May 1967 at a [[Georgie Fame]] concert at [[The Bag O'Nails]] club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=432}} As Paul remembers, "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to&nbsp;... Pushiness worked for me that night!"<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=45}}: Paul and Linda's first meeting, {{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=587}}: "Pushiness worked for me that night!"; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=432–434}}: Linda's UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London.</ref>

Linda said this about their meeting: "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else [that night]&nbsp;... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=587}} The pair married in March 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, "We had a lot of fun together&nbsp;... just the nature of how we aren't, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment."{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=514–515}} He added, "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off&nbsp;... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we did."{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=525}}

After the [[break-up of the Beatles]], the two collaborated musically and formed Wings in 1971.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=904–910}} They faced derision from some fans and critics, who questioned her inclusion. She was nervous about performing with Paul, who explained, "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy."{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} Paul defended her musical ability: "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard&nbsp;... She took a couple of lessons and learned some bluesy things&nbsp;... she did very well and made it look easier than it was&nbsp;... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a [[Minimoog]], which could only be played with one finger. It was [[Monophonic synthesizer|monophonic]]."{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} He went on to say, "We thought we were in it for the fun&nbsp;... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves."{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned."{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=84}}

They had four children—Linda's daughter [[Heather McCartney|Heather]] (legally adopted by Paul), [[Mary McCartney|Mary]], [[Stella McCartney|Stella]], and [[James McCartney|James]]—and remained married until Linda's death from breast cancer at age 56 in 1998.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=585–601}} After Linda died, Paul said, "I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [about wishing I'd been] perfect all the time&nbsp;... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies."{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=600–601}}

===== John Lennon =====
[[File:Lennon-McCartney.JPG|thumb|McCartney with [[John Lennon]] in 1964]]
Though McCartney had a strained relationship with Lennon post-Beatles, they briefly became close again in early 1974, and [[A Toot and a Snore in '74|played music together]] on one occasion.<ref>{{harvnb|Badman|1999|pp=122–123}}; {{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=218–219}}; {{harvnb|Sandford|2006|pp=227–229}}</ref> In later years, the two grew apart.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=587}} McCartney often phoned Lennon, but was apprehensive about the reception he would receive. During one call, Lennon told him, "You're all pizza and fairytales!"{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=588}} In an effort to avoid talking only about business, they often spoke of cats, babies, or baking bread.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=590}}

On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were watching an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' at Lennon's home in [[the Dakota]] when [[Lorne Michaels]] made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the ''SNL'' studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together.<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=504–505}}: On 24 April 1976, the two were watching ''Saturday Night Live'', last time Lennon and McCartney spent time together; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=592}}: Lennon: "We nearly got a cab, but we were actually too tired".</ref> [[VH1]] fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film ''[[Two of Us (2000 film)|Two of Us]]''.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=869–870}} McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released ''[[Double Fantasy]]'', was friendly: "[It is] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't have any kind of blow-up", he said.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Joan|title=Playboy Interview: Paul and Linda McCartney|journal=Playboy|volume=31, no. 12|issue=December 1984|page=82}}</ref>

====== Reaction to Lennon's murder ======

{{quote box|quote= John is kinda like a constant&nbsp;... always there in my being&nbsp;... in my soul, so I always think of him.<ref>{{harvnb|Graff|2000|p=40}}: "John is kinda like a constant&nbsp;... always there in my being,{{harvnb|Graff|2000|p=96}}: "in my soul, so I always think of him".</ref> |source= — McCartney, ''Guitar World'', January 2000 |width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

On 9 December 1980, McCartney followed the news that [[Murder of John Lennon|Lennon had been murdered]] the previous night; Lennon's death created a [[media frenzy]] around the surviving members of the band.{{sfn|Carlin|2009|pp=255–257}} McCartney was leaving an [[Oxford Street]] recording studio that evening when he was surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for what appeared to be a superficial response.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He later explained, "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon:

{{blockquote|I talked to Yoko the day after he was killed, and the first thing she said was, "John was really fond of you." The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, "it's only me." They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}}
}}

In 1983, McCartney said: "I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his 'mask' and have a better relationship with him."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennon's death made the remaining ex-Beatles nervous that they might also be murdered.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=594}} He told ''Mojo'' magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=506}} In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to Lennon, "[[All Those Years Ago]]", which featured Starr on drums.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=20}} McCartney released "[[Here Today (Paul McCartney song)|Here Today]]" in 1982, a song Everett described as "a haunting tribute" to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=10}}

===== George Harrison =====
[[File:Beatles Paul McCartney.png|thumb|McCartney and Harrison in 1964]]
Discussing his relationship with McCartney, Harrison said: "Paul would always help along when you'd done his ten songs—then when he got 'round to doing one of my songs, he would help. It was silly. It was very selfish, actually&nbsp;... There were a lot of tracks, though, where I played bass&nbsp;... because what Paul would do—if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): 'Do this'. He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Glazer|first=Mitchell|title=Growing Up at 33⅓: The George Harrison Interview|journal=Crawdaddy|issue=February 1977|pages=35–36}}</ref>

After Harrison's death in November 2001, McCartney said he was "a lovely guy and a very brave man who had a wonderful sense of humour". He went on to say: "We grew up together and we just had so many beautiful times together—that's what I am going to remember. I'll always love him, he's my baby brother."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html|title=I'll always love him, he's my baby brother, says tearful McCartney|work=The Telegraph|last1=Poole|first1=Oliver|last2=Davies|first2=Hugh|date=1 December 2001|access-date=4 May 2012|location=London|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507033014/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html|archive-date=7 May 2012}}</ref> On the first anniversary of his death, McCartney played Harrison's "Something" on a [[ukulele]] at the ''[[Concert for George]]''; he would perform this rendition of the song on many subsequent solo tours.{{sfn|Doggett|2009|pp=332–333}} He also performed "[[For You Blue]]" and "[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]", and played the piano on Eric Clapton's rendition of "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]".{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=138–139}}

===== Ringo Starr =====
During a recording session for ''The Beatles'' in 1968, the two got into an argument over McCartney's critique of Starr's drum part for "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]", which contributed to Starr temporarily leaving the band.<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=816}}; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=495}}: "Paul ticked Ringo off over a fluffed tom-tom fill. They had already argued about how the drum part should be played&nbsp;... and Paul's criticisms finally brought matters to a head"; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=310}}: "The ill-feeling&nbsp;... finally erupted&nbsp;... after an argument with McCartney over the drum part".</ref> Starr later commented on working with McCartney: "Paul is the greatest bass player in the world. But he is also very determined&nbsp;... [to] get his own way&nbsp;... [thus] musical disagreements inevitably arose from time to time."{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=816}}
