'''AC/DC''' are<!-- Don't change "are" to "is"; in Australian English band names are treated as noun plurals. --> an <!--Do not change per talk page consensus -->Australian<!--Do not change per talk page consensus --> rock band formed in [[Sydney]] in 1973. Their music has been variously described as [[hard rock]], [[blues rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although the band calls it simply "[[rock and roll]]". They are cited as a formative influence on the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] bands. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2003 and have sold over 200 million records worldwide, making them [[List of best-selling music artists |one of the best-selling artists of all time]].

AC/DC were founded by brothers [[Angus Young|Angus]] (lead guitar) and [[Malcolm Young]] (rhythm guitar), with [[Colin Burgess (musician)|Colin Burgess]] (drums), [[Larry Van Kriedt]] (bass guitar) and [[Dave Evans (singer)|Dave Evans]] (lead vocals). They underwent several line-up changes before releasing their debut [[Australasia]]n-only album, ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]'' (1975). Membership stabilised after the release of ''[[Let There Be Rock]]'' (1977), with the Young brothers, [[Phil Rudd]] on drums, [[Cliff Williams]] on bass guitar and [[Bon Scott]] on lead vocals. Seven&nbsp;months after the release of ''[[Highway to Hell]]'' (1979), Scott died of [[alcohol poisoning]] and English singer [[Brian Johnson]] was then recruited as their new frontman. Their first&nbsp;album with Johnson, ''[[Back in Black]]'' (1980), dedicated to Scott's memory, became the [[List of best-selling albums|second&nbsp;best-selling album of all time]]. Their eighth&nbsp;studio album, ''[[For Those About to Rock We Salute You|For Those About to Rock]]'' (1981), was their first&nbsp;album to reach number&nbsp;one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Rudd was fired partway through the ''[[Flick of the Switch]]'' sessions in 1983 and was replaced by [[Simon Wright (musician)|Simon Wright]], who was replaced by [[Chris Slade]] six&nbsp;years later.

AC/DC experienced a commercial resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of album ''[[The Razors Edge (AC/DC album)|The Razors Edge]]'' (1990); it was their only record to feature Slade, as Rudd returned in 1994. Rudd has since recorded five more albums with the band, starting with ''[[Ballbreaker]]'' (1995). Their fifteenth&nbsp;studio album, ''[[Black Ice (album)|Black Ice]]'', was the second&nbsp;highest-selling record of 2008 and their highest chart peak since ''For Those About to Rock'', eventually reaching number&nbsp;one worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same for 20&nbsp;years until 2014, when Malcolm retired due to early-onset [[dementia]], from which he died three&nbsp;years later; additionally, Rudd was charged with threatening to kill and possession of [[methamphetamine]] and [[cannabis]]. Angus and Malcolm's nephew, [[Stevie Young]], replaced Malcolm and debuted on the album ''[[Rock or Bust]]'' (2014). On the [[Rock or Bust World Tour|accompanying tour]], Slade filled in for Rudd. In 2016, [[Guns N' Roses]] singer [[Axl Rose]] replaced Johnson for the rest of the tour dates due to a risk of hearing loss. Williams retired at the end of the tour and the band entered a two-year hiatus. A reunion of the ''Rock or Bust'' line-up was announced in September 2020; the band's seventeenth&nbsp;studio album, ''[[Power Up (album)|Power Up]]'', was released two months later. [[Power Up Tour|Its supporting tour]] was announced in February 2024, with drummer [[Matt Laug]] and bassist [[Chris Chaney]] replacing Rudd and Williams, though both remain official members.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]] said AC/DC utilizes "dirty" [[guitar riffs]], "snarling" singing, and "catchy, [[wikt:anthemic|anthemic]]" [[Hook (music)|hooks]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=AC/DC Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More {{!}} All... |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ac-dc-mn0000574772#biography |access-date=2024-12-19 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref> According to ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' music journalist [[David Marchese]], the instrumental foundation of the band's simple sound was the drummer—Rudd, Wright, or Slade—striking the [[kick drum]] on the first&nbsp;and third&nbsp;[[beat (music)|beat]] of every [[measure (music)|measure]] and the [[snare drum]] on the second&nbsp;and fourth&nbsp;beat; bass guitarist Williams consistently [[downpicking|down-picking]] an [[eighth note]]; Angus performing lead parts that possessed "a clear architecture and even sort of swing, in a frenzied, half-demented way"; and Malcolm's "propulsive" yet nuanced rhythm guitar featuring "little ''chuks'', stutters, and silences that give the monstrous riffs life."<ref name="Marchese">{{cite magazine|last=Marchese|first=David|author-link=David Marchese|date=16 September 2016|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/09/acdc-axl-rose-tour-retire.html|title=AC/DC Has Improbably Become the Most Poignant Story in Rock|magazine=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810205129/http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/acdc-axl-rose-tour-retire.html|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

For the majority of Malcolm's tenure in AC/DC, he used a [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] [[JMP Super Bass|Super Bass]] head to amplify his rhythm guitar while recording in the studio. According to Chris Gill of ''[[Guitar World]]'', this amplifier helped define his signature guitar tone: "clean but as loud as possible to ride on the razor's edge of power amp distortion and deliver the ideal combination of grind, twang, clang and crunch, with no distorted preamp 'hair,' fizz or compression", as heard on songs such as "Let There Be Rock", "Dirty Deeds", "For Those About to Rock" and "Thunderstruck". During 1978 to 1980, Malcolm used a Marshall 2203 100-watt master volume head, which Gill speculates may have contributed to a "slightly more distorted and dark" guitar tone on the albums from that period, including ''Powerage'' and ''Back in Black''.<ref name="AutoJ4-50">{{cite magazine|last=Gill|first=Chris|date=2 January 2018|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/acdc-thunderstruck-secrets-behind-malcolm-young-guitar-sound-tonal-recall|title=The Secrets Behind Malcolm Young's Guitar Sound on AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck'|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|access-date=9 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810072525/https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/acdc-thunderstruck-secrets-behind-malcolm-young-guitar-sound-tonal-recall|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In a comparison of AC/DC's vocalists, [[Robert Christgau]] said Scott exhibited a "blokelike croak" and "charm", often singing about sexual aggression under the guise of fun: "Like [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]] or [[Roger Chapman]] though without their panache, he has fun being a dirty young man".{{sfn|Christgau|1990}} Johnson, in his opinion, possessed "three times the range and wattage" of a vocalist while projecting the character of a "[[bloke]] as fantasy-fiction demigod".{{sfn|Christgau|1990}} By the time Johnson had fully acclimated himself to 1981's ''For Those About to Rock We Salute You'', Christgau said he defined "an anthemic grandiosity more suitable to [the band's] precious-metal status than [Scott]'s old-fashioned raunch", albeit in a less intelligent manner.{{sfn|Christgau|1990}}

{{blockquote|AC/DC will assert that they are not specifically a metal band. Their music—loud, hard, and guitar-driven—may best be described as hard rock. However, there are people who will say that they are indisputably metal. Therein lies the ongoing problem of categorisation. While AC/DC has referenced the underworld and they have given their listeners 'Highway to Hell' and 'Hell's Bells,' their songs are constructed on straightforward major and minor power chords. They are not modally developed as are a good deal of heavy metal compositions. Their sound is loud and crisp, not muddy or down-tuned.}}

With the recording of ''Back in Black'' in 1980, rock journalist Joe S. Harrington believed the band had departed further from the blues-oriented rock of their previous albums and toward a more dynamic attack that adopted punk rock's "high-energy implications" and transmuted their hard rock/heavy metal songs into "more pop-oriented blasts". The band would remain faithful to this "impeccably ham-handed" musical style for the remainder of their career: "the guitars were compacted into a singular statement of rhythmic efficiency, the rhythm section provided the thunderhorse overdrive and vocalist Johnson bellowed and brayed like the most unhinged practitioner of bluesy top-man dynamics since vintage [[Robert Plant]]."{{sfn|Harrington|2003}}

For the book ''Under My Thumb: Songs That Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them'', ''The Guardian'' arts critic Fiona Sturges contributed an essay evaluating her love for AC/DC. While acknowledging she is a feminist and that the band's music is problematic for her, she believed it would be "daft as opposed to damaging" for female listeners if they could understand the band to be "a bunch of archly sex-obsessed idiots with sharp tunes and some seriously killer riffs". Despite the "unpleasant sneering quality" of "Carry Me Home"{{'}}s claims about a woman who "ain't no lady", the "rape fantasy" of "Let Me Put My Love into You" and the generally one-dimensional portrayals of women, Sturges said songs such as "Whole Lotta Rosie" and "You Shook Me All Night Long" demonstrated that the female characters "are also having a good time and are, more often than not, in the driving seat in sexual terms. [...] [I]t's the men who come over as passive and hopeless, awestruck in the presence of sexual partners more experienced and adept than them."<ref name="Sturges" />
