'''Steven Patrick Morrissey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒr|ɪ|s|i}}; born 22 May 1959), known as '''Morrissey''', is an English singer and songwriter. He came to prominence as the frontman and lyricist of the rock band [[the Smiths]], who were active from 1982 to 1987. Since then he has pursued a successful solo career. Morrissey's music is characterised by his [[baritone]] voice and distinctive lyrics with  [[anti-establishment]] stances and recurring themes of emotional isolation, sexual longing, self-deprecation, and dark humour.

Morrissey was born to working-class Irish immigrants in [[Old Trafford (area)|Old Trafford]], Lancashire, England;<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bourne |first=Dianne |date=7 June 2025 |title=Morrissey halts Manchester homecoming show for surprise announcement |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/morrissey-halts-manchester-homecoming-show-31811597 |access-date=10 June 2025 |website=Manchester Evening News}}</ref> the family lived in Queen's Court near the Loreto convent in [[Hulme]] and his mother worked nearby at the [[Hulme Hippodrome]] bingo hall. They moved due to the 1960s demolitions of almost all the Victorian-era houses in Hulme, known as '[[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|slum clearance]]', and he grew up in nearby [[Stretford]].<ref name=":3" /> As a child he developed a love of literature, [[kitchen sink realism]] and 1960s [[pop music]]. In the late 1970s he fronted the [[punk rock]] band [[the Nosebleeds]] with little success before beginning a career in music journalism and writing several books on music and film in the early 1980s. (Morrissey later said, in 2024, that he "did not ever join" the Nosebleeds.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |last=Peters |first=Daniel |date=2 December 2024 |title=Morrissey says he has 'no connection' with The Nosebleeds and Slaughter And The Dogs, despite claims on Wikipedia |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/morrissey-says-no-connection-nosebleeds-slaughter-and-the-dogs-wikipedia-3817577 |access-date=2 December 2024 |website=NME}}</ref>) He formed the Smiths with [[Johnny Marr]] in 1982 and the band soon attracted national recognition for [[The Smiths (album)|their eponymous debut album]]. As the band's frontman, Morrissey attracted attention for his trademark [[quiff]] and witty and sardonic lyrics. Deliberately avoiding rock machismo, he cultivated the image of a sexually ambiguous social outsider who embraced celibacy. The Smiths released three further studio albums—''[[Meat Is Murder]]'', ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]'' and ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come]]''—and had a string of hit singles. The band were critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following. Personal differences between Morrissey and Marr resulted in the separation of the Smiths in 1987.

In 1988 Morrissey launched his solo career with ''[[Viva Hate]]''. This album and its follow-ups—''[[Kill Uncle]]'' (1991), ''[[Your Arsenal]]'' (1992) and ''[[Vauxhall and I]]'' (1994)—all did well on the UK Albums Chart and spawned multiple hit singles. He took on [[Alain Whyte]] and [[Boz Boorer]] as his main co-writers to replace Marr. During this time his image began to shift into that of a more robust figure who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s his albums ''[[Southpaw Grammar]]'' (1995) and ''[[Maladjusted]]'' (1997) also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, United States, he took a musical hiatus from 1998 to 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, ''[[You Are the Quarry]]'', in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of the albums ''[[Ringleader of the Tormentors]]'' (2006), ''[[Years of Refusal]]'' (2009), ''[[World Peace Is None of Your Business]]'' (2014), ''[[Low in High School]]'' (2017), ''[[California Son]]'' (2019) and ''[[I Am Not a Dog on a Chain]]'' (2020), as well as [[Autobiography (Morrissey book)|his autobiography]] (2013) and his debut novel, ''[[List of the Lost]]'' (2015).

Highly influential, Morrissey has been credited as a seminal figure in the emergence of [[indie pop]], [[indie rock]] and [[Britpop]]. In a 2006 poll for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Culture Show]]'' Morrissey was voted the second-greatest living [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music/morrissey-is-second-most-iconic-brit-1051578 |title=Morrissey is second most iconic Brit |date=15 February 2007 |work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref> His work has been the subject of academic study.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/mar/30/highereducation.popandrock |title=Morrissey: a suitable subject for academia |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Leo |last=Benedictus |date=30 March 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk-news/morrisseys-lyrics-are-there-wilde-and-larkin-claims-academic-2511620 |title=Morrissey's lyrics are up there with Wilde and Larkin, claims academic |work=The Scotsman |date=21 May 2009 |access-date=19 June 2020}}</ref> He has been a controversial figure throughout his music career due to his forthright opinions and outspoken nature, endorsing vegetarianism and [[animal rights]] and [[Criticism of monarchy|criticising royalty]] and prominent politicians.

== Early life ==
=== 1959–1976: Childhood ===
[[File:Queen's Square, Hulme.png|thumb|250x250px|Morrissey's family home (second from left) in Queens Square, Hulme, which was demolished in the 1960s. His aunt lived beside them in the end property.]]
Steven Patrick Morrissey was born on 22 May 1959 in [[Old Trafford (area)|Old Trafford]], Lancashire.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=6|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=32}} His parents, Elizabeth (''née'' Dwyer) and Peter Morrissey, were [[Irish Catholics]]{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=33}} who had emigrated to [[Manchester]] from [[Dublin]] with his only sibling, his elder sister, Jacqueline, a year before his birth.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=6}} Morrissey claims he was named after American actor [[Steve Cochran]],{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=6|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=21}} although he may instead have been named in honour of his father's brother who died in infancy, Patrick Steven Morrissey.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goddard |first1=Simon |title=Mozipedia : The encyclopedia of Morrissey and The Smiths |date=2010 |publisher=Plume |isbn=978-0-452-29667-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mozipediaencyclo00godd_0/page/418 418] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mozipediaencyclo00godd_0/page/418 }}</ref> His earliest home was a [[council house]] at 17 Harper Street in the Queen's Square area of [[Hulme]], inner Manchester, since demolished.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=39}}<ref name=BBC85>{{Cite AV media |title=1985: MORRISSEY on MANCHESTER {{!}} Oxford Road Show {{!}} Classic BBC Music |work=BBC Archive | date=September 2022 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYabx_Y_xjs |access-date=21 February 2023 |via=YouTube}}</ref><ref name=":3" /> Living in that area as a child, he was deeply affected by the [[Moors murders]], in which a number of local children were killed; the crimes had a lasting impression on him and would inspire the lyrics of the Smiths song "[[Suffer Little Children]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2pp=43–44}} He also became aware of the [[anti-Irish sentiment]] in British society against [[Irish migration to Great Britain|Irish immigrants to Britain]].{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=53}} In 1970, after the "[[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|slum clearances]]" of Victorian-era houses in Hulme, the family moved to another council house at 384 King's Road in [[Stretford]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=8}}

==== Education ====
Following a primary education at St Wilfred's Primary School, Morrissey failed his [[11-plus]] exam and proceeded to St Mary's Secondary Modern School, an experience he found unpleasant.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2pp=37–38}} He excelled at athletics, though he was an unpopular [[loner]] at the school.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=17|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=38}} He left school in 1975, having received no formal qualifications.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=18}} He continued his education at [[Trafford College|Stretford Technical College]], where he gained three [[O-Levels]] in English literature, sociology, and the General Paper.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=18|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=76}}

In 1985, he gave a tour of Manchester for the ''[[Oxford Road Show]]'' and spoke fondly of St Wilfred's, including meeting his former teachers and going through a photo album. Later in the tour, he arrived at St Mary's and described it in highly negative terms, wryly closing with "Not to be recommended."<ref name=BBC85 /> He has been critical of his formal education, later stating, "The education I received was so basically evil and brutal. All I learnt was to have no self-esteem and to feel ashamed without knowing why."{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=38}} He has also discussed being subjected to [[corporal punishment]] as a student,<ref>''Ear Say'', [[Channel 4]] (7 July 1984).</ref> which is the subject of the Smiths' 1985 song "[[The Headmaster Ritual]]". Education is a recurring theme in his lyrics, such as "The Teachers Are Afraid of the Pupils" from ''[[Southpaw Grammar]]'' (1995) and the ''[[Years of Refusal]]'' bonus track "Because of My Poor Education" (2009). The working title for his first solo album ''[[Viva Hate]]'' was ''Education in Reverse'' and it was initially released in Australia under that title, though this was later rectified.<ref>{{Discogs release|id=628000|name=Education In Reverse|type=album}}</ref>

Morrissey's librarian mother encouraged her son's interest in reading.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=39–40}} He took an interest in feminist literature,{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=42}} citing examples such as [[Marjorie Rosen]], [[Molly Haskell]] and [[Susan Brownmiller]] in a 1983 interview with ''[[NME]]''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Portrait of the Artist as a Consumer |magazine=NME |date=17 September 1983 |url=https://www.morrissey-solo.com/wiki/Portrait_Of_The_Artist_As_A_Consumer_-_NME_(September_17,_1983)|access-date=28 January 2025 |via=Morrissey-Solo.com}}</ref> He particularly liked the Irish author [[Oscar Wilde]], whom he came to idolise.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=12–13|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2pp=39–40}} The young Morrissey was a fan of the television soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', which focused on working-class communities in Manchester; he sent proposed scripts and storylines to its production company, [[Granada Television]], although all were rejected.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=7|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2pp=53–55}} He was also a fan of [[Shelagh Delaney]]'s ''[[A Taste of Honey]]'' and its [[A Taste of Honey (film)|1961 film adaptation]], which was a drama focusing on working-class life in [[Salford]].{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=55–58}} Many of his later songs directly quoted ''A Taste of Honey''.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=56–57}}

Of his youth, Morrissey has said, "Pop music was all I ever had, and it was completely entwined with the image of the pop star.

[[File:James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause.jpg|thumb|upright|Morrissey idolised the American film actor [[James Dean]] and published a book about him.]]
Having left formal education, Morrissey proceeded through a series of jobs, as a clerk for the civil service and then the [[Inland Revenue]],<ref name="Civil Service World">{{cite news |url=https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/culture/heaven-knows-he-was-miserable-then-morrissey-reflects-life-civil-servant |title=Heaven knows he was miserable then: Morrissey reflects on life as a civil servant |last=Dunton |first=Jim |date=22 May 2019 |work=[[Dods Group#News|Civil Service World]] |access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref> as a salesperson in a [[record store]], and as a hospital porter, before abandoning employment and claiming [[unemployment benefits]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=20, 23–24|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=76}} He used much of the money from these jobs to purchase tickets for gigs, attending performances by [[Talking Heads]], the [[Ramones]], and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=20}} He regularly attended concerts, having a particular interest in the alternative and post-punk music scene.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=11}} Having met the guitarist [[Billy Duffy]] in November 1977, Morrissey agreed to become the vocalist for Duffy's punk band [[the Nosebleeds]],{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=22}} although Morrissey later said, in 2024, that he "did not ever join" the band.<ref name=":4" /> Morrissey co-wrote a number of songs with the band{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=9}}—"Peppermint Heaven", "I Get Nervous" and "I Think I'm Ready for the Electric Chair"{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=22}}—and performed with them in support slots for [[Jilted John]] and then [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=10}} The band soon disbanded.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=23}}

He came to be known as a minor figure within Manchester's punk community.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=12}} By 1981 he had become a close friend of [[Linder Sterling]], the frontwoman of the [[punk jazz]] ensemble [[Ludus (band)|Ludus]]; her lyrics and style of singing both influenced him.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=23|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=12}} Through Sterling he came to know [[Howard Devoto]] and [[Richard Boon]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=12}} At the time Morrissey's best male friend was James Maker; he would visit Maker in London or they would meet in Manchester, where they visited the city's gay bars and gay clubs, in one case having to escape from a gang of [[gay bashers]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=26–28}}

Wanting to become a professional writer,{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=77}} Morrissey considered a career in music journalism. He frequently wrote letters to the music press and was eventually hired by the weekly music review publication ''[[Record Mirror]]''.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=11}} He wrote several short books for local publishing company Babylon Books: in 1981 it released a 24-page booklet he had written on the New York Dolls, which sold 3000 copies.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=25–26|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=11}} This was followed by ''James Dean is Not Dead'', about the late American film star [[James Dean]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=11}} Morrissey had developed a love of Dean and had covered his bedroom with pictures of the dead film star.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=82—85}}

=== 1982–1984: Establishing the Smiths ===
{{Main|The Smiths}}

In August 1978 Morrissey was briefly introduced to the 14-year-old [[Johnny Marr]] by mutual acquaintances at a [[Patti Smith]] gig held at Manchester's [[O2 Apollo|Apollo Theatre]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=9}} Several years later, in May 1982, Marr turned up on the doorstep of Morrissey's house, there to ask Morrissey if he was interested in co-founding a band.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=32|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=16–17}} Marr had been impressed that Morrissey had authored a book on the New York Dolls, and was inspired to turn up on his doorstep following the example of [[Jerry Leiber]], who had formed his working partnership with [[Mike Stoller]] after turning up at the latter's door.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=32|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=16}} According to Morrissey: "We got on absolutely famously. We were very similar in drive."<ref name="DIDiscs">{{cite episode |title=Desert Island Discs with Morrissey |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p068y#b00p068y |series=Desert Island Discs |series-link=Desert Island Discs |network=BBC Radio 4 |airdate=29 November 2009 |last=Young |first=Kirsty |author-link=Kirsty Young}}</ref> The next day, Morrissey phoned Marr to confirm that he would be interested in forming a band with him.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=17}} Steve Pomfret—who had served as the band's first bassist—soon abandoned the band, to be replaced by Dale Hibbert.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=19, 21}} Around the time of the band's formation, Morrissey decided that he would be publicly known only by his surname,{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=42}} with Marr referring to him as "Mozzer" or "Moz".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}} In 1983 he forbade those around him from using the name "Steven", which he despised.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}} Morrissey was also responsible for choosing the band name of "the Smiths",{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=20}} later informing an interviewer that "it was the most ordinary name and I thought it was time that the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}}

Alongside developing their own songs, they also developed a cover of [[the Cookies]]' "I Want a Boy for My Birthday", the latter reflecting their deliberate desire to transgress established norms of gender and sexuality in rock in a manner inspired by the New York Dolls.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=35|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=22–23}} In August 1982 they recorded their first demo at Manchester's Decibel Studios,{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=33|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=22–23}} and Morrissey took the demo recording to [[Factory Records]], but they were not interested.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=26–27}} In late summer 1982 [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] was adopted as the band's drummer after a successful audition.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=35|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=25–26}} In October 1982 they then gave their first public performance, as a support act for [[Blue Rondo à la Turk (band)|Blue Rondo à la Turk]] at Manchester's [[The Ritz (Manchester)|The Ritz]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=34–35|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=27}} Hibbert however was unhappy with what he perceived as the band's gay aesthetic; in turn, Morrissey and Marr were unhappy with his bass playing, and so he was removed from the band and replaced by Marr's old school friend [[Andy Rourke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=36|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=27–30}}

[[File:Morrissey's shirt in Hard Rock Cafe Balcerona.jpg|thumb|left|A typical shirt worn on stage by Morrissey in the 1980s, on display at the Barcelona [[Hard Rock Café]]]]
After the record company [[EMI Records|EMI]] turned them down,{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=31}} Morrissey and Marr visited London to hand a cassette of their recordings to [[Geoff Travis]] of the independent record label [[Rough Trade Records]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=41–42}} Although not signing them to a contract straight away, he agreed to cut their song "[[Hand in Glove]]" as a single.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=42}} Morrissey chose a [[homoerotic]] cover design in the form of a [[Jim French (photographer)|Jim French]] photograph.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=42–43}} It was released in May 1983. The band soon generated controversy when [[Garry Bushell]] of tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' alleged that their B-side "Handsome Devil" was an endorsement of [[paedophilia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2004|1p=108|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=35–36}} The band denied this, with Morrissey stating that the song "has nothing to do with children, and certainly nothing to do with child molesting".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=37}} In the wake of their single, the band performed their first significant London gig, gained radio airplay with a [[John Peel]] session, and obtained their first interviews in the music magazines ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}}

The follow-up singles "[[This Charming Man]]" and "[[What Difference Does It Make?]]" fared better when they reached numbers 25 and 12 respectively on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="guinness book">{{harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=509–510}}.</ref> Aided by praise from the music press and a series of studio sessions for Peel and [[David Jensen]] at [[BBC Radio 1]], the Smiths began to acquire a dedicated fan base. In February 1984 they released their debut album, ''[[The Smiths (album)|The Smiths]]'', which reached number 2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="guinness book" />

As frontman of the Smiths, Morrissey—described as "lanky, soft-spoken, bequiffed and bespectacled"{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=32}}—subverted many of the norms that were associated with pop and rock music.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=23–24}} The band's aesthetic simplicity was a reaction to the excess personified by the [[New Romantic]]s,{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=101}} and while Morrissey adopted an androgynous appearance like the New Romantics or earlier glam rockers, his was far more subtle and understated.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=102}} According to one commentator, "he was bookish; he wore [[NHS]] spectacles and a hearing aid on stage; he was celibate. Worst of all, he was sincere", with his music being "so intoxicatingly melancholic, so dangerously thoughtful, so seductively funny that it lured its listeners ... into a relationship with him and his music instead of the world."{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=24}} In an [[academic paper]] on the band, Julian Stringer characterised the Smiths as "one of Britain's most overtly political groups",{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=16}} while in his study of their work, Andrew Warns termed them "this most anti-capitalist of bands".{{sfn|Warnes|2008|p=143}} Morrissey had been particularly vocal in his criticism of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]; after the October 1984 [[Brighton hotel bombing]], he commented that "the only sorrow" of it was "that Thatcher escaped unscathed".{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=111}} In 1988 he stated that [[Section 28]] "embodies Thatcher's very nature and her quite natural hatred".{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=111}}

=== 1984–1987: The Smiths' growing success ===
{{Quote box

| quote = The Smiths brought realism to their romance, and tempered their angst with the lightest of touches. The times were personified in their frontman: rejecting all taints of rock n' roll machismo, he played up the social awkwardness of the misfit and the outsider, his gently haunting vocals whooping suddenly upward into a falsetto, clothed in outsize women's shirts, sporting National Health specs or a huge Johnny Ray-style hearing aid. This charming young man was, in the vernacular of the time, the very antithesis of a "rockist"—always knowingly closer to the gentle ironicist [[Alan Bennett]], or self-lacerating diarist [[Kenneth Williams]], than a licentious [[Mick Jagger]] or drugged-out [[Jim Morrison]].

In 1984 the band released two non-album singles: "[[Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now]]" (their first UK top-ten hit) and "[[William, It Was Really Nothing]]". The year ended with the compilation album ''[[Hatful of Hollow]]''. This collected singles, [[B-sides]] and the versions of songs that had been recorded throughout the previous year for the Peel and Jensen shows. Early in 1985, the band released their second album, ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'', which was their only studio album to top the UK charts. The single-only release "[[Shakespeare's Sister (song)|Shakespeare's Sister]]" reached number 26 on the UK Singles Chart, though the only single taken from the album, "[[That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore]]", was less successful, barely making the top 50.<ref name="guinness book" /> "[[How Soon Is Now?]]" was originally a B-side of "William, It Was Really Nothing", and was subsequently featured on ''Hatful of Hollow'' and the American, Canadian, Australian and Warner UK editions of ''[[Meat Is Murder]]''. Belatedly released as a single in the UK in 1985, "How Soon Is Now?" reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart.

During 1985 the band undertook lengthy tours of the UK and the US while recording the next studio record, ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]''. The album was released in June 1986, shortly after the single "[[Bigmouth Strikes Again]]". The record reached number 2 in the UK charts.<ref name="guinness book" /> All was not well within the band. A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule.<ref name="mainstream">Kelly, Danny (14 February 1987).

Gannon stayed in the band, switching to rhythm guitar. This five-piece recorded the singles "[[Panic (The Smiths song)|Panic]]" and "[[Ask (song)|Ask]]" (with [[Kirsty MacColl]] on backing vocals) which reached numbers 11 and 14 respectively on the UK Singles Chart,<ref name="guinness book" /> and toured the UK. After the tour ended in October 1986, Gannon left the band. The band had become frustrated with Rough Trade and sought a record deal with a major label, ultimately signing with [[EMI Records|EMI]], which drew criticism from some of the band's fanbase.<ref name="mainstream" />

In early 1987 the single "[[Shoplifters of the World Unite]]" was released and reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="guinness book" /> It was followed by a second compilation album, ''[[The World Won't Listen]]'', which reached number 2 in the charts—and the single "[[Sheila Take a Bow]]", the band's second (and last during the band's lifetime) UK top-10 hit.<ref name="guinness book" /> Despite their continued success, personal differences within the band—including the increasingly strained relationship between Morrissey and Marr—saw them on the verge of breaking up. In July 1987, Marr left the band and auditions to find a replacement proved fruitless.

By the time that the band's fourth album, ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come]]'', was released in September, the band had broken up. Morrissey attributed the band's break-up to the lack of a managerial figure—in a 1989 interview with then-teenage fan [[Tim Samuels]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.morrissey-solo.com/content/interview/greenscene/index4.html|title='Meat Is Murder' (from 'Greenscene', 1989), page 4|website=Morrissey-solo.com|access-date=30 September 2021}}</ref> ''Strangeways'' peaked at number 2 in the UK, but was only a minor US hit,<ref name="guinness book" /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the smiths|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History—The Smiths: Albums|magazine=Billboard|access-date=13 August 2008}}</ref> though it was more successful there than the band's previous albums.

== Solo career ==
=== 1988–1991: Early solo work ===
Several months before the Smiths dissolved, Morrissey enlisted [[Stephen Street]] as his personal producer and new songwriting partner, with whom he could begin his solo career.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=102}} By September 1987 he had begun work on his first solo album, ''[[Viva Hate]]'', at [[The Wool Hall]] studio near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]; it was recorded with the musicians [[Vini Reilly]] and [[Andrew Paresi]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=102–103}} Rather than featuring pre-existing images of celebrities, as the Smiths' album and single covers had done, the cover sleeve of ''Viva Hate'' featured a photograph of Morrissey taken by [[Anton Corbijn]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=106}} In February 1988, EMI released the first single from this album, "[[Suedehead]]", which reached number 5 on the British singles chart, a higher position than any Smiths single had achieved.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=104}} The second single from the album, "[[Everyday Is Like Sunday]]", was released in June and reached number 9.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=109}} The album reached number 1 on the UK album charts.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=106}} The album's final song, "Margaret on the Guillotine", featured descriptions of Thatcher being executed; in response, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] member of Parliament [[Geoffrey Dickens]] accused Morrissey of being involved in a terrorist network and police [[Special Branch (Metropolitan Police)|Special Branch]] conducted a search of his Manchester home.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=113–114}}

Morrissey's first solo performance took place at [[Wolverhampton Civic Hall]] in December 1988.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=119}} The event attracted huge crowds, and the ''NME'' journalist [[James Brown (editor)|James Brown]] observed that "the excitement and atmosphere inside the hall was like nothing I have ever experienced at any public event".{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=120}} Following ''Viva Hate'', Morrissey put out two new singles; "[[The Last of the Famous International Playboys]]" was about the [[Kray twins]], gangsters who operated in the [[East End of London]], and reached number 6 on the UK singles chart.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=122–126}} This was followed by "[[Interesting Drug]]", which reached number 9.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=125}} After his songwriting partnership with Street ended and was replaced by [[Alan Winstanley]] and [[Clive Langer]], he recorded "[[Ouija Board, Ouija Board]]", released as a single in November 1989; it reached number 18.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=127}} Christian spokespeople and tabloid newspapers condemned the song, claiming that it promoted [[occultism]], to which Morrissey responded that "the only contact I ever made with the dead was when I spoke to a journalist from ''The Sun''."{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=128}}

[[File:Forum Inglewood.JPG|thumb|left|In the 1990s Morrissey sold out [[Kia Forum|The Forum]] in [[Los Angeles]] in fifteen minutes.]]
With Winstanley and Langer he began work on his first compilation album, ''[[Bona Drag]]'', although only recorded six new songs for it, the rest of the album comprising his recent singles and B-sides.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=133–134}} The album reached number 9 on the UK album chart.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=138}} Two of the newly recorded ''Bona Drag'' tracks were released as singles: "[[November Spawned a Monster]]", a song about a woman who is a wheelchair user, reached number 12 in the charts but received criticism from some who believed that it mocked disabled people.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=134–135}} The second, "[[Piccadilly Palare]]", referenced London [[rent boys]] and featured terms from the [[polari]] gay slang. Released in November 1990, it reached number 19 in the charts.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=135}} The song attracted some criticism from the British gay press, who were of the opinion that it was wrong for Morrissey to use polari when he was not openly gay;{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=137–138}} in an interview the previous year he had nevertheless acknowledged his attraction to both men and women.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=129–130}}

Adopting [[Mark E. Nevin]] as his new songwriting partner, Morrissey created his second solo album, ''[[Kill Uncle]]''; released in March 1991, it peaked at number 8 on the album chart.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=139}} The two singles released in promotion of the album, "[[Our Frank]]" and "[[Sing Your Life]]", failed to break the Top 20 on the singles charts, reaching number 26 and 33 respectively.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=139}}<ref name="guinness book solo">{{harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=379–380}}.</ref> Another of the album's tracks, "Found, Found, Found", alluded to Morrissey's friendship with [[Michael Stipe]], the lead singer of American indie rock band [[R.E.M.]]{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=140}} Planning his first solo tour, Morrissey assembled several musicians with a background in [[rockabilly]] for his new backing group, including the guitarist [[Boz Boorer]], [[Alain Whyte]] and Spencer Cobrin.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=143}} Morrissey began the ''Kill Uncle'' tour in Europe; he brought [[Phranc]] as his [[support act]] and decorated the stage of each performance with a large image of [[Edith Sitwell]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=146–147}} On the US leg of his tour, he sold out Los Angeles' 18,000 seat [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]] in fifteen minutes, faster than [[Michael Jackson]] or [[Madonna]] had done.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=156}} During the performance, [[David Bowie]] joined him onstage for a rendition of T. Rex's "[[Cosmic Dancer]]".{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=156}} In the US he sold out 25 of his 26 other performances;{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=156}} one appearance in Texas was filmed by [[Tim Broad]] for release as the [[VHS]] ''Live in Dallas''.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=159}} He proceeded to Japan—where he was frustrated by the authorities' tough stance toward fans—and then Australasia, where he cancelled several dates due to acute sinusitis.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=162–166}}

The early 1990s were described by the biographer [[David Bret]] as the "black phase" in Morrissey's relationship with the British music press, which was increasingly hostile and critical of him.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=145}} In some cases, this involved the press spreading misinformation, such as the claim that he and Phranc were recording a cover of "[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]";{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=155}} others, such as those of Barbara Ellen in ''[[NME]]'', were closer to personal attack than musical review.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=167}} ''NME'' claimed that his cancelled performances reflected a disrespect towards his fans.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=188–189}} He became increasingly reticent in talking to British music journalists,{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=171}} expressing frustration at how they constantly compared his solo work with that of the Smiths; "my past is almost denying me a future".{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=152–153}} He told one interviewer that the band he was then working with were technically better musicians than the Smiths had ever been.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=152–153}}

=== 1992–1995: Changing image ===
In July 1992 Morrissey released the album ''[[Your Arsenal]]'', which peaked at number 2 in the album chart.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=174}} It was the final release from producer [[Mick Ronson]]; Morrissey related that working with Ronson had been "the greatest privilege of my life".{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=173}} ''Your Arsenal'' reflected Morrissey's lament for what he regarded as the decline of British culture in the face of increasing Americanisation.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=175}} He told one interviewer that "everything is informed by American culture—everyone under fifty speaks American—and that's sad. We once had a strong identity and now that's gone completely".{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=175}} A number of the tracks on the album, most notably "[[Certain People I Know]]" and "The National Front Disco", dealt with the lives and experiences of tough, working-class youths.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=145–146}} ''Your Arsenal'' was critically well received,{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=144}} and often described as his best album since ''Viva Hate''.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=174}} The first single, "[[We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful]]", had been released in April 1992 and peaked at number 17;{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=172}} this was followed by "[[You're the One for Me, Fatty]]", which reached number 19 and "Certain People I Know", which reached number 34.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=177}} From September to December, Morrissey embarked on a 53-date ''Your Arsenal'' tour in which he varyingly decorated the stage with backdrops of [[skinhead]] girls,<ref>{{cite book |first=Len|last=Brown|title=Meetings with Morrissey|publisher= Omnibus|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84772-987-3}}</ref> [[Diana Dors]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Charlie Richardson]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=190–191, 199}} One of the performances was recorded and released as ''[[Beethoven Was Deaf]]'' (1993).{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=200}}

By the release of ''Your Arsenal'', Morrissey's image had changed; according to Simpson, the singer had converted "from the aesthete interested in rough lads into a rough lad interested in aestheticism (and rough lads)".{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=144}} According to Woods, Morrissey developed an air of "quietly assured masculinity", representing "a more robust, burlier, beefier version of himself",{{sfn|Woods|2007|p=7}} while the poet and Morrissey fan [[Simon Armitage]] described the transition as being one from that of "stick-thin, knock-me-over-with-a-feather campness" to that of a "mobster and bare-knuckle boxer image".<ref>{{cite web |title=Morrissey interview: Big mouth strikes again |first=Simon |last=Armitage |website=The Guardian |date=3 September 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/03/morrissey-simon-armitage-interview}}</ref> This new image was reflected in the cover art for ''Your Arsenal''; a photograph taken by Sterling, it featured Morrissey onstage with his shirt open, displaying a muscular torso beneath.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=144}}

[[File:York Hall.jpg|thumb|left|The [[York Hall]] boxing venue, which Morrissey frequented in the mid-1990s]]
In mid-1993 Morrissey co-wrote his fifth album, ''[[Vauxhall and I]]'', with Whyte and Boorer; it was produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=202, 204|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=154}} Morrissey described the album as "the best I've ever made",{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=204}} and at the time believed it would be either his final or penultimate work.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=201}} It was both a critical and commercial success,{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=205|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=151}} topping the UK album chart in March 1994.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=205}} The album had been named after [[Vauxhall]], a district of South West London famous for the [[Royal Vauxhall Tavern]] gay pub.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=204}} One of the album's songs, "[[The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get]]", was released as a single at the time and reached number 8 in the UK.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=204}} The single's sleeve featured images of Jake Walters, a skinhead in his twenties, who was living with Morrissey at the time.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=204–205}} Walters had introduced Morrissey to [[York Hall]], a boxing venue in [[Bethnal Green]], part of London's East End, and Morrissey spent an increasing amount of time there.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=214}}

That year, he also released a non-album single, "[[Interlude (Timi Yuro song)|Interlude]]", a duet with [[Siouxsie Sioux]]: the track was a cover of a [[Timi Yuro]] song. The record was published under the banner "Morrissey & Siouxsie"; due to record company issues, "Interlude" was only available on import outside Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Morrissey|title=Autobiography|publisher=London: Penguin Classics|date=2013|isbn=978-0-14-139481-7|pages=268–273}}<br />{{cite book |last=Paytress |first=Mark |title=Siouxsie & the Banshees: The Authorised Biography |publisher=Sanctuary |year=2003 |isbn=1-86074-375-7|page=216}}</ref>

In the autumn of 1994 Morrissey recorded five songs at the [[Olympic Studios]] in South London.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=216}} In January 1995 the single "[[Boxers (Morrissey single)|Boxers]]" was released, reaching number 23 on the singles chart.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=217}} In February 1995 he embarked on the ''Boxers'' tour, supported by the band [[Marion (band)|Marion]] and featuring a backdrop depiction of the boxer [[Cornelius Carr]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=219}} One of these performances was filmed by [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]] and released as the VHS ''Introducing Morrissey''.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=221}} In December 1995 the song "[[Sunny (Morrissey song)|Sunny]]" was released as a single; a lament for Morrissey's terminated relationship with Walters, the song was the first of Morrissey's singles not to chart.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=216}} In 1995 the compilation album ''[[World of Morrissey]]'' was released, containing largely B-sides.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=219–220}}

=== 1995–2003: Move to Los Angeles ===
After his contract with EMI expired, Morrissey signed to [[RCA Victor|RCA]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=224}} On this label he recorded his next album, ''[[Southpaw Grammar]]'', at the [[Miraval Studios]] in southern France before releasing it in August 1995.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=224, 226}} Its cover art featured an image of the boxer [[Kenny Lane]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=226}} It reached number 4 in the UK album charts,{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=226}} but made little impact compared to its two predecessors.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=159}} In September 1995, Morrissey served as the support act for the British leg of Bowie's [[Outside Tour]].{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=233}} Backstage at the [[Aberdeen]] gig, Morrissey was taken ill and taken to hospital; he did not return for the rest of the tour.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=237–238}} Later referring to the tour critically, he said that when you become involved with Bowie, "you have to worship at the Temple of David".{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=262–263}}

In December 1996 a legal case against Morrissey and Marr brought by Smiths' drummer Mike Joyce arrived at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]. Joyce alleged that he had not received his fair share of recording and performance royalties from his time with the band, calling for at least £1&nbsp;million in damages and 25% of all future Smiths album sales. After a seven-day hearing, the judge ruled in favour of Joyce.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=240–243}}<ref>{{cite web | date=11 December 1996 | title=Rock band drummer awarded £1m payout | publisher=BBC |via=Cemetrygates.com | url=http://www.cemetrygates.com/vault/news/court.html | access-date =22 April 2007}}</ref> In summing up the case, Judge Justice Weeks referred to Morrissey as "devious, truculent and unreliable when his own interests were at stake", with the words "devious" and "truculent" being widely used in press coverage of the ruling.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=243–244|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2pp=161–162}} Marr paid the money legally owed to Joyce but Morrissey launched an appeal against the ruling.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=162}} He said that the judge had been biased against him from the start of the proceedings because of his public criticisms of Thatcher and her government.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=245}} Morrissey lost his appeal in July 1998, although he launched another soon after;{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=245}} this too was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web | year=1998 | title=Joyce vs. Morrissey and Others | work=England and Wales Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Decisions | url=https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/1711.html | access-date=16 February 2007}}</ref> In a November 2005 statement, Morrissey said that Joyce had cost him £600,000 in legal fees alone and approximately £1,515,000 in total.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_051130_01|title =Statement from Morrissey|author =Morrissey|website =True To You|date =30 November 2005 |access-date =7 December 2007|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120510054040/http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_051130_01|archive-date =10 May 2012|url-status=dead|df =dmy-all}}</ref>

Marr did not publicly comment, but had then-recently posted a picture of [[Reform UK]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] to dismiss calls to reunite in the aftermath of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]'s reunion. Marr previously said in 2016 that Morrissey's politics aligned with Farage's, joking that any potential Smiths reunion would feature Farage as their replacement guitarist.<ref name="bbc reunion 2024">{{cite news |last1=Long |first1=Chris |title=Morrissey claims Johnny Marr 'ignored' 2025 Smiths reunion offer |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp352111wyxo |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=2 September 2024}}</ref>

Marr's statement also clarified other claims made by Morrissey's team on his website, including that Marr had filed for 100% ownership of the Smiths' intellectual property and trademark rights without having consulted with Morrissey, despite the fact that "Morrissey alone created the musical unit name 'the Smiths' in May 1982".<ref>{{cite web | title=MESSAGES FROM MORRISSEY | website=MORRISSEY CENTRAL | date=16 September 2024 | url=https://www.morrisseycentral.com/messagesfrommorrissey/the-plot-thickens | access-date=22 September 2024}}</ref> In Marr's statement it was clarified that Marr discovered that the band did not own the trademark, and in an effort to protect the trademark from a third party attempt made in 2018 to use the band's name, Marr registered the trademark solely under his name after a failure to receive a response from Morrissey and his representatives. In January 2024 Marr signed an agreement to share ownership of the name with Morrissey, an agreement Morrissey has yet to follow up on. Marr further clarified that the efforts to take the trademark were not to tour under the Smiths' name with a singer of Marr's choice (contrary to the claims made by Morrissey's team), but rather simply to protect the band's name and use of the name.<ref name="Marr Variety">{{cite web|last=Aswad|first=Jem|title=Johnny Marr Responds to Morrissey's Claims About Smiths Reunion Tour, Name Ownership: 'It Was Left to Me to Protect the Legacy'|work=Variety|date=17 September 2024|url=https://variety.com/2024/music/news/smiths-johnny-marr-responds-to-morrissey-reunion-tour-1236147686/|access-date=22 September 2024}}</ref>

=== Lyrics ===
[[Mark Simpson (journalist)|Mark Simpson]] characterised Morrissey as "the anti-pop idol", representing "the last, greatest and most gravely worrying product of an era when pop music was all there was".{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=10, 11}} The music journalist and biographer [[Johnny Rogan]] stated that Morrissey's œuvre seems based on "endlessly re-examining a lost, painful past".{{sfn|Rogan|1992|p=15}} Morrissey's lyrics have been described as "dramatic, bleak, funny [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] about doomed relationships, lonely nightclubs, the burden of the past and the prison of the home".<ref name="gatti">{{cite news |last=Gatti |first=Tom |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article1080659.ece |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708224920/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article1080659.ece |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2008 |title=Morrissey: the musical |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=25 June 2005 |access-date=23 August 2009}}</ref> According to Mark Simpson, there is a common feeling that his music's emphasis on the sadness of life is depressing.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=127}}

[[File:Morrissey Live at SXSW Austin in March 2006-8.jpg|thumb|left|Morrissey Live at SXSW Austin in March 2006]]
His lyrics are characterised by their usage of black humour, self-deprecation, and the pop vernacular.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=48–49}} Many of his lyrics avoid mentioning the gender of the narrator, and thus provide both male and female listeners with multiple points of identification.{{sfnm|1a1=Stringer|1y=1992|1p=24|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=61}} Simpson felt that his lyrics often highlighted "the essential absurdity of gender".{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=103}} Discussing the Smiths' lyrics in 1992, Stringer highlighted that they placed great emphasis on the concept of Englishness, but added that unlike the contemporary [[2 Tone (music genre)|Two-Tone]] and [[acid house]] movements, they focused on white England rather than exploring its multi-cultural counterpart.{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=20}} Although noting that during the 1980s emphasising white identity was a trait closely linked with right-wing politics, Stringer expressed the view that the Smiths represented "the only sustained response that white, English pop/rock music was able to make" against the Thatcher government's "appropriation of white, English national identity".{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=20}}

His lyrics have expressed disdain for many elements of British society, including the government, church, education system, royal family, meat-eating, money, gender, discos, fame, and relationships.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=99}} In his lyrics for the Smiths, Morrissey avoided explicit descriptions of the consummation of sex; rather, he sings about the anticipation, frustration, aversion, or final disappointment with sex.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=10–101}} Stringer suggested that this deliberate avoidance of sex was a reflection of the band's 'Englishness' because it invoked English cultures' "lack of emotional expression, the way in which feelings, and especially sexual feelings, cannot be expressed directly through casual touch, body contact and so on".{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=22}} Male homoerotic elements can be found in many of the Smiths' lyrics,{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=106}} but these also included sexualised descriptions featuring women.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=107–208}}

Morrissey has described having "a macabre fascination" with violence.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=232}} Simpson opined that Morrissey's lyrics "bleed and throb with violent imagery", citing the references to bus crashes and suicide pacts in "There is a Light that Never Goes Out", smashed teeth in "Bigmouth Strikes Again", and [[nuclear apocalypse]] in both "Ask" and "Everyday is Like Sunday".{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=131}} More broadly, Morrissey had a longstanding interest in thuggery, whether that be murderers, gangsters, rough trade, or skinheads.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=226}}

=== Performance style ===
[[File:Morrissey and band at Zitadelle Spandau in Berlin 2011.jpg|thumb|right|As a solo performer, Morrissey typically featured older imagery as his stage backdrop, as seen here at a 2011 performance in Berlin]]
Morrissey's vocals have been cited as having a particularly distinctive quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Stringer|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=48}} Simpson believed that Morrissey's work embodied and personified that of the "Northern Women", speaking in styles of vernacular language that would be common to many women living in [[northern England]].{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=49–50}} In this he was strongly influenced by the Northern singer [[Cilla Black]], who had a successful career as a pop music singer in the 1960s,{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=50}} as well as [[Viv Nicholson]], who similarly earned fame during that decade.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=50}} Other female singers from that decade who have been cited as an influence on Morrissey have been the Scottish [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]],{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=50}} and the Essexer [[Sandie Shaw]].{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=52–53}} However, Stringer noted that rather than expressly singing in a Mancunian working-class accent, Morrissey adopted a "very clipped, precise enunciation" and sang in "clear English diction".{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=19}} He is also noted for his unusual [[baritone]] vocal style (though he sometimes uses [[falsetto]]).<ref name="greatestsingers">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/morrissey-20101202 |title=The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time—92: Morrissey |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=3 December 2010}}</ref>

When performing onstage, he often whips his microphone cord about, particularly during his up-tempo tracks.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=131}} Simpson believed that Morrissey often gave "slyly aggressive gestures" while onstage; he cited two instances from ''Top of the Pops'', one in which Morrissey used hand gestures to pretend shooting at the audience during "Shoplifters of the World Unite" and another in which he turned his microphone cord into a hangman's noose while repeating the lyrics "Hang the DJ, hang the DJ" in the song "Panic".{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=132}} Rogan claimed that Morrissey exhibited "a power onstage which I have seldom seen from any other artiste of his generation", and that while performing he "oozes charisma, offering that peculiar combination of gauche vulnerability and athleticism".{{sfn|Rogan|1992|p=15}}

On various occasions, Morrissey has expressed anger when he believes that bouncers and the security teams at his concerts have treated the audience poorly. For instance, at his [[San Antonio]] concert as part of the ''Your Arsenal'' tour he stopped his performance to rebuke bouncers for hitting fans.{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=193–194}}

On 12 November 2022, while playing a live show in Los Angeles at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]], he finished the set just after 9 songs and left without notice, upsetting many fans.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Garvey |first=Marianne |date=15 November 2022 |title=Morrissey upsets crowd after ending concert 30 minutes in |url=https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/entertainment/morrissey-concert-ends-abrupt-music/index.html |access-date=16 November 2022 |publisher=CNN}}</ref> The bandmates hung around for over 10 minutes before realising he was not coming back and it was announced that the show was being cancelled for "unforseen circumstances".

=== Public image ===
Julian Stringer has characterised Morrissey as a man with various contradictory traits, being "an ordinary, working-class 'anti-star' who nevertheless loves to hog the spotlight, a nice man who says the nastiest things about other people, a shy man who is also an outrageous narcissist".{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=16}} He further suggested that part of Morrissey's appeal was that he conveyed the image of a "cultivated English gentleman, being every inch the typically English 'gent' he is perfectly representative of that type's loathing for cant and hypocrisy, and his fragile, quasi-gay sexuality".{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=17}} Similarly, Morrissey's biographer [[David Bret]] described him as being "quintessentially English",{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=vii}} while Mark Simpson termed him a [[Little Englander]].{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=147}} Morrissey is known for his criticism of the British music press, royalty, politicians and people who eat meat.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=117}} According to Bret, his "withering attacks" on those he disliked are typically delivered in a "laid-back" manner.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=116}}

During the 1980s the interviewer [[Paul Morley]] stated that Morrissey "sets out to be a decent man and he succeeds because that is what he is".{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=118}} Eddie Sanderson, who interviewed Morrissey for ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' in 1992, said that "underneath all the rock star flim-flam, Morrissey is actually a very nice chap, excellent company, perfectly willing and able to talk about any subject one cared to throw at him".{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=183}} Having photographed him in 2004, Mischa Richter described Morrissey as "genuinely lovely".{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=266}}

In January 2006 Morrissey attracted criticism when he stated that he accepts the motives behind the militant tactics of the [[Animal Rights Militia]], saying, "I understand why fur-farmers and so-called laboratory scientists are repaid with violence—it is because they deal in violence themselves and it's the only language they understand."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://true-to-you.net/questions_with_answers_from_morrissey |title=View questions and answers |publisher=True To You |access-date=13 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626114539/http://true-to-you.net/questions_with_answers_from_morrissey |archive-date=26 June 2010}}</ref> He has criticised people who are involved in the promotion of eating meat, including [[Jamie Oliver]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Message from Morrissey|url=http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_101204_01|website=True-to-you.net|access-date=19 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615041823/http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_101204_01|archive-date=15 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Clarissa Dickson Wright]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Questions answered|url=http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_060104_01|website=True-to-you.net|access-date=19 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716191758/http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_060104_01|archive-date=16 July 2012}}</ref> The latter had already been targeted by some animal rights activists for her stance on [[fox hunting]].

Morrissey's sexuality has been the subject of much speculation and coverage in the British press during his career,{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=vii}} with claims varyingly being made that he was celibate, a frustrated heterosexual, or bisexual.{{sfn|Woods|2007|p=6}} In a 1980 letter he described both himself and his "girlfriend" as bisexual.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=25|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=24}} The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' states that he created a "compellingly conflicted persona (loudly proclaimed celibacy offset by coy hints of closeted homosexuality)" that has "made him a peculiar heartthrob".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/549957/the-Smiths&tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=the%20Smiths%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=The Smiths—Britannica Online Encyclopaedia |access-date=13 August 2010}}</ref> Speculation was further fuelled by the frequent references to gay subculture and slang in his lyrics. In 2006 Liz Hoggard from ''The Independent'' said: "Only 15 years after homosexuality had been [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|decriminalised]], his lyrics flirted with every kind of gay subculture."<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/morrissey-the-alan-bennett-of-pop-480979.html |title=Morrissey: The Alan Bennett of pop |newspaper=The Independent |first=Liz |last=Hoggard |date=4 June 2006}}</ref>

During his years with the Smiths, Morrissey professed to being celibate, which stood out at a time when much of pop music was dominated by visible sexuality.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=114}} Marr said in a 1984 interview that Morrissey "doesn't participate in sex at the moment and hasn't done so for a while".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cemetrygates.com/vault/smiths/record.html |title=Record Mirror: 9&nbsp;June 1984 |publisher=Cemetrygates.com |date=9 June 1984 |access-date=13 August 2010}}</ref> Repeatedly, interviewers asked Morrissey if he was gay, which he denied.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=117}} In response to one such inquiry in 1985, he stated that "I don't recognise such terms as heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, and I think it's important that there's someone in pop music who's like that. These words do great damage, they confuse people and they make people feel unhappy, so I want to do away with them."{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=117}} As his career developed, there was increased pressure placed on him to [[come out of the closet]],{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=119}} although he presented himself as a non-practising bisexual.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=130}} In a 1989 interview he said that he was "always attracted to men and women who were never attracted to me" and thus he did not have "relationships at all".{{sfn|Bret|2004|pp=129–130}} In 2013, he released a statement that said, "Unfortunately, I am not homosexual.

In an [[academic paper]] on the Smiths, Julian Stringer characterised the band as "one of Britain's most overtly political groups",{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=16}} while Andrew Warns termed them the "most [[anti-capitalist]] of bands".{{sfn|Warnes|2008|p=143}} [[Simon Goddard]] described Morrissey as being "pro-working class, anti-elite and anti-institution.

The [[BBC]] has referred to him as "one of the most influential figures in the history of British pop",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8062610.stm |title=The 'Pope of Mope' turns 50 |work=BBC News |date=22 May 2009 |access-date=23 August 2009}}</ref> and ''NME'' named the Smiths the "most influential artist ever" in a 2002 poll, even topping [[the Beatles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.morrissey-solo.com/articles/02/04/15/2040257.shtml |work=Morrissey-Solo |title=The Smiths: most influential artist ever—NME |date=15 April 2002 |access-date=13 March 2012}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'', naming him one of the greatest singers of all time in a 2014 poll, noted that his "rejection of convention" in his vocal style and lyrics is the reason "why he redefined the sound of British rock for the past quarter-century".<ref name="greatestsingers" /> Morrissey's enduring influence has been ascribed to his wit, the "infinite capacity for interpretation" in his lyrics,<ref name="gatti" /> and his appeal to the "constant navel gazing, reflection, solipsism" of generations of "disenfranchised youth", offering unusually intimate "companionship" to broad demographics.<ref name="anderman" /> Paul A. Woods described Morrissey as "Britain's unlikeliest rock 'n' roll star in several decades", noting that at the same time he was also "its most essential".{{sfn|Woods|2007|p=5}} Bret described him as "probably the most intellectually gifted and imaginative lyricist of his generation",{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=3}} listing him alongside [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Jacques Brel]] as being one of "the ''monstres sacrés''".{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=286}}

The journalist [[Mark Simpson (journalist)|Mark Simpson]] calls Morrissey "one of the greatest pop lyricists—and probably ''the'' greatest-ever lyricist of desire—that has ever moaned" and observes that "he is fully present in his songs as few other artists are, in a way that fans of most other performers ... wouldn't tolerate for a moment."{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=13}} Simpson also argues that "After Morrissey there could be no more pop stars. His was an impossible act to follow ... [his] unrivalled knowledge of the pop canon, his unequaled imagination of what it might mean to be a pop star, and his breathtakingly perverse ambition to turn it into great art, could only exhaust the form forever".<ref>{{cite news |last=Simpson |first=Mark |title=The man who murdered pop |newspaper=The Guardian |date=5 November 1999}}</ref>

In 2006 Morrissey was voted the second greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBC's ''[[Culture Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=culture show |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/livingicons/vote/ |title=BBC—Culture Show—Living Icons |work=BBC News |access-date=13 August 2010}}</ref> The ''[[All Music]] Guide to Rock'' asserts that Morrissey's "lyrical preoccupations", particularly themes dealing with English identity, proved extremely influential on subsequent artists.<ref>Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bgn9SGmA4dkC All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul]'', via Google Books, pg. 1346.</ref> The journalist [[Philip Collins (journalist)|Philip Collins]] also described him as a major influence on modern music and "the best British lyricist in living memory".<ref>{{cite news |last=Collins |first=Philip |url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/pop-music-cant-do-politics-any-more-xlldtfnx7lr |title=Pop music can't do politics any more |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=29 October 2009}}</ref> In 1998 he received an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1998/ |title=The Ivors 1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813023728/http://theivors.com/archive/1990-1999/the-ivors-1998/ |archive-date=13 August 2018 |website=TheIvors.com |access-date=3 January 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2002 ''NME'', by this point a critic of Morrissey, nevertheless considered him to be the "most influential artist ever".{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=12}} In 2004 ''Q'' gave him its best songwriter award.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=223}}

In November 2008 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked Morrissey as 92nd of "The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time".

[[Colin Meloy]] of [[the Decemberists]], who recorded a 2005 EP of Morrissey covers titled ''[[Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey]]'', acknowledged Morrissey's influence on his songwriting: "You could either bask in that glow of fatalistic [[narcissism]], or you could think it was funny.

In an April 2021 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled "[[Panic on the Streets of Springfield]]", Morrissey inspired the parody character of Quilloughby. Voiced by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], Quilloughby is portrayed as a romantic figment of [[Lisa Simpson]]'s imagination. She has her dream shattered when she finds out that he has aged into a grey, meat-eating overweight frontman with anti-immigrant views. The episode was criticised by Morrissey as based on "complete ignorance".<ref>{{cite news |title=Morrissey hits back at The Simpsons over parody: 'Complete ignorance' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/19/morrissey-the-simpsons-parody-panic-on-the-streets-of-springfield |work=The Guardian |date=20 April 2021 |first1=Lucy |last1=Campbell |first2=Ben |last2=Beaumont-Thomas}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=HELLO HELL – MESSAGES FROM MORRISSEY |url=https://www.morrisseycentral.com/messagesfrommorrissey/hello-hell |website=MORRISSEY CENTRAL}}</ref>
