Joining [[Faces (band)|Faces]] in 1969, he also launched a solo career, releasing his debut album, ''[[An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down]]'', that year. Stewart's early albums were a fusion of rock, [[folk music]], [[soul music]], and R&B.<ref>{{cite web |last=Eder |first=Bruce |title=Truth: Review |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1564|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=1 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=Faces: Biography |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4218|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=1 May 2009}}</ref> His third album, 1971's ''[[Every Picture Tells a Story]]'', was his breakthrough, topping the charts in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, as did its single "[[Maggie May]]". His 1972 follow-up album, ''[[Never a Dull Moment (Rod Stewart album)|Never a Dull Moment]]'', also reached number one in the UK and Australia, while going top three in the US and Canada. Its single, "[[You Wear It Well]]", topped the chart in the UK and was a moderate hit elsewhere.

After Stewart had a handful more UK top-ten hits, Faces broke up in 1975. Stewart's next few hit singles were ballads, with "[[Sailing (Sutherland Brothers song)|Sailing]]", taken from the 1975 UK and Australian number-one album ''[[Atlantic Crossing]]'', becoming a hit in the UK and the Netherlands (number one), Germany (number four) and other countries, but barely charting in North America. ''[[A Night on the Town (Rod Stewart album)|A Night on the Town]]'' (1976), his fifth straight chart-topper in the UK, began a three-album run of going number one or top three in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia with each release. That album's "[[Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)]]" spent almost two months at number one in the US and Canada, and made the top five in other countries. ''[[Foot Loose & Fancy Free]]'' (1977) contained the hit "[[You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)]]" as well as the rocker "Hot Legs". ''[[Blondes Have More Fun]]'' (1978) and its disco-tinged "[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]" both went to number one in Canada, Australia and the US, with "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" also hitting number one in the UK and the top ten in other countries. Stewart's albums regularly hit the upper rungs of the charts in the Netherlands throughout the 1970s and in Sweden from 1975 onward.

After a disco and [[New wave music|new wave]] period in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stewart's music turned to a [[soft rock]]/[[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road]] style, with most of his albums reaching the top ten in the UK, Germany and Sweden, but faring less well in the US. The single "[[Rhythm of My Heart]]" was a top five hit in the UK, US and other countries, with its source album, 1991's ''[[Vagabond Heart]]'', becoming, at number ten in the US and number two in the UK, his highest-charting album in a decade. In 1993, he collaborated with [[Bryan Adams]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] on the power ballad "[[All for Love (song)|All for Love]]", which went to number one in many countries. In the early 2000s, he released a series of successful albums interpreting the [[Great American Songbook]].

==Early life==
Roderick David Stewart was born at 507 Archway Road, [[Highgate]], North London, on 10 January 1945, the youngest of five children of Robert Joseph Stewart<ref name="auto">1939 England and Wales Register</ref> and Elsie Rebecca Gilbart.<ref name="nb-53">Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 53.</ref> His father was Scottish and had been a [[master builder]] in [[Leith]], Edinburgh, while Elsie was English and had grown up in [[Upper Holloway]] in north London. Married in 1928, the couple had two sons and two daughters while living in Scotland, and then moved to Highgate.

In 1995, Brentford Deputy President Eric White was quoted as saying, "He trained with us for a week or two, and he may even have kicked a ball around with the juniors, but there is no record of Rod Stewart ever having signed to Brentford. Unfortunately, nobody at the club remembers his time here."<ref name="mojo95"/> In his 2012 autobiography, Stewart attributes all of this to a tale that took on its own life, partly and deliberately helped by statements he made in interviews, such as to talk show host [[Michael Parkinson]].<ref name="auto-19"/>}} In any case, regarding possible career options, Stewart concluded, "Well, a musician's life is a lot easier and I can also get drunk and make music, and I can't do that and play football. I plumped for music ... They're the only two things I can do actually: play football and sing."<ref name="nb-54"/><ref name="eh-10-11"/>

In January 1964,{{refn|group="nb"|A much-written-about happenstance, some sources give the date of the Stewart–Baldry rail station meeting as 5 January,<ref name="mojo95"/> some as 7 January (but that may be confusing it with the date of Cyril Davies' death), some imply that it is after 7 January,<ref name="Gray-8"/> while some sources give no specific date.}} while Stewart was waiting at [[Twickenham railway station]] after having seen [[Long John Baldry]] and the [[All-Stars (band)|All Stars]] at [[Eel Pie Island Hotel|Eel Pie Island]],<ref name="mojo95"/><ref name="eh-33-39">Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 33–39.</ref><ref>Wooldridge, ''Rock 'n' Roll London'', pp. 65–66.</ref> Baldry heard him playing "[[Smokestack Lightnin']]" on his harmonica, and invited him to sit in with the group; when Baldry discovered Stewart was a singer as well, he offered him a job for £35 a week, after securing the approval of Stewart's mother.<ref name="eh-33-39"/> Quitting his day job at the age of nineteen, Stewart gradually overcame his shyness and nerves and became a visible enough part of the act that he was sometimes added to the billing as "Rod the Mod" Stewart,<ref name="nb-58"/><ref name="eh-33-39"/><ref name="Gray-8">Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 8.</ref> the nickname coming from his [[dandy]]ish style of grooming and dress.<ref name="cby-375"/> Baldry touted Stewart's abilities to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine and the group enjoyed a weekly residence at London's fabled [[Marquee Club]].<ref name="Gray-8"/> In June 1964, Stewart made his recording debut (without label credit) on "[[Up Above My Head]]", the B-side to a Baldry and Hoochie Coochie Men single.<ref name="Gray-9">Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 9.</ref> While still with Baldry, Stewart embarked on a simultaneous solo career.<ref name="nb-59">Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 59.</ref> He made some demo recordings,{{refn|group="nb"|The demo recordings <!--with?--> were later released in 1976, against Stewart's wishes.<ref name="Gray-10"/>}} was scouted by [[Decca Records]] at the Marquee Club, and signed to a solo contract in August 1964.<ref name="Gray-10">Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', pp. 10–12.</ref> He appeared on several regional television shows around the country and recorded his first single in September 1964.<ref name="nb-59"/><ref name="Gray-10"/>

Turning down Decca's recommended material as too commercial, Stewart insisted that the experienced session musicians he was given, including [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], learn a couple of [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]] songs he had just heard.<ref>Tremlett, ''The Rod Stewart Story'', as quoted extensively in Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', pp. 60–61.</ref> The resulting single, "[[Good Morning Little Schoolgirl]]", was recorded and released in October 1964.

Stewart's "Rod the Mod" image gained wider visibility in November 1965, when he was the subject of a 30-minute [[Associated-Rediffusion|Rediffusion, London]] television documentary titled "An Easter with Rod" that portrayed the Mod scene.<ref name="BBC04"/><ref name="Gray-15-17">Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', pp. 15–17.</ref> His parallel solo career attempts continued on [[EMI]]'s [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia label]] with the November 1965 release of "The Day Will Come", a more heavily arranged pop attempt, and the April 1966 release of his take on [[Sam Cooke]]'s "[[Shake (Sam Cooke song)|Shake]]", with the [[Brian Auger Trinity]].<ref name="Gray-15-17"/> Both failed commercially, and neither gained positive notices.<ref>Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', p. 56.</ref> Stewart had spent the better part of two years listening mostly to Cooke; he later said, "I didn't sound like anybody at all ... but I knew I sounded a bit like Sam Cooke, so I listened to Sam Cooke."<ref name="rs-intv-70"/> This recording solidified that singer's position as Stewart's idol and most enduring influence; he called it a "crossing of the water".<ref name="cby-375"/><ref name="rs-intv-70"/><ref name="nb-61"/>

Stewart left Steampacket in March 1966,<ref name="Gray-15-17"/> with Stewart saying he had been sacked and Auger saying he had quit.<ref name="nb-61"/> Stewart then joined a somewhat similar outfit, [[Shotgun Express]], in May 1966 as co-lead vocalist with [[Beryl Marsden]].<ref name="nb-61"/><ref name="Gray-15-17"/> The other members included [[Mick Fleetwood]] and [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] (who went on to form [[Fleetwood Mac]]), and [[Peter Bardens]].<ref name="Gray-15-17"/> Shotgun Express released one unsuccessful single in October 1966, the orchestra-heavy "I Could Feel The Whole World Turn Round", before disbanding.<ref name="nb-61"/><ref name="Gray-15-17"/> Stewart later disparaged Shotgun Express as a poor imitation of Steampacket and said, "I was still getting this terrible feeling of doing other people's music. I think you can only start finding yourself when you write your own material."<ref name="Gray-15-17"/> By now, Stewart had bounced around without achieving much success, with little to distinguish himself among other aspiring London singers other than the emerging rasp in his voice.<ref name="rshist-377"/>

===1967–1969: Jeff Beck Group period===
Guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] recruited Stewart for his new post-[[the Yardbirds|Yardbirds]] venture,<ref name="carson-71">Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', pp. 71–72.</ref> and in February 1967, Stewart joined [[the Jeff Beck Group]] as vocalist and sometime songwriter.<ref name="Gray-18-21">Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', pp. 18–21.</ref> This would become the big break of his early career.<ref name="cby-375"/> There he first played with [[Ronnie Wood]]<ref name="nb-61"/> whom he had first met in a London pub in 1964;<ref name="Gray-10"/> the two soon became fast friends.<ref name="carson-71"/> During its first year, the group experienced frequent changes of drummers and conflicts involving manager [[Mickie Most]] wanting to reduce Stewart's role. They toured the UK and released a couple of singles that featured Stewart on their B-sides.<ref name="Gray-18-21"/><ref name="carson-78">Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', pp. 75, 78, 83–86.</ref> Stewart's sputtering solo career also continued with the March 1968 release of non-hit "Little Miss Understood" on [[Immediate Records]].<ref name="Gray-18-21"/>

The Jeff Beck Group toured Western Europe in spring 1968, recorded, and were nearly destitute. Then assistant manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] booked them on a six-week tour of the United States starting in June 1968 with the [[Fillmore East]] in New York.<ref name="Gray-18-21"/><ref name="nyt061568"/><ref name="carson-81">Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', pp. 81–82.</ref> Stewart, on his first trip to America, suffered terrible stage fright during the opening show and hid behind the amplifier banks while singing.

In August 1968, their first album, ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'', was released, and by October, it had risen to number 15 on the [[Billboard 200|US albums chart]] but failed to chart in the UK.<ref name="Gray-18-21"/> The album featured Beck's masterly guitar technique and manipulated sounds as Stewart's dramatic vocalising tackled the group's varied repertoire of blues, folk, rock, and proto-[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].<ref name="rshist-377"/><ref name="carson-78"/><ref name="amg-truth">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1564|pure_url=yes}}|title=Truth: Review|first=Bruce|last=Eder|author-link=Bruce Eder|website=AllMusic|access-date=14 February 2010}}</ref> Stewart also co-wrote three of the songs<ref name="amg-truth"/> and credited the record for helping to develop his vocal abilities and the sandpaper quality in his voice.<ref name="rs-intv-70"/> The group toured America again at the end of the year to a strong reception, then suffered from more personnel upheaval<ref name="Gray-18-21"/><ref>Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', p. 89.</ref> (something that would continue throughout Beck's career).

In the two and a half years I was with Beck I never once looked him in the eye – I always looked at his shirt or something like that."<ref name="Gray-18-21"/>

The group's second album, ''[[Beck-Ola]]'', was released in June 1969 in the US and in September 1969 in the UK, bracketing the time the group was dissolving; it also made number 15 in the US albums chart and reached number 39 in the [[UK albums chart]].<ref name="cby-375"/><ref name="Gray-22"/><ref>{{cite web| url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1566|pure_url=yes}}|title=Beck-Ola: Review|first=William|last=Ruhlmann|website=AllMusic|access-date=14 February 2010}}</ref> During his time with the group, Stewart initially felt overmatched by Beck's presence, and his style was still developing; but later Stewart felt the two developed a strong musical, if not personal, rapport.<ref name="Gray-18-21"/><ref>''The New Rolling Stone Record Guide'', p. 34.</ref> Much of Stewart's sense of phrasing was developed during his time with the Jeff Beck Group.<ref name="rs-intv-70"/> Beck sought to form a new [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] with [[Carmine Appice]] and [[Tim Bogert]] (of the similarly just-breaking-up [[Vanilla Fudge]]) joining him and Stewart, but Stewart had other plans.<ref>Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', pp. 74, 76.</ref>

===1969–1975: Solo career established and Faces albums===
[[Mercury Records]] [[A&R]] man [[Lou Reizner]] had seen Stewart perform with Beck, and on 8 October 1968 signed him to a solo contract;<ref name="Gray-18-21"/> but contractual complexities delayed Stewart's recording for him until July 1969.<ref name="Gray-22"/><ref>Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', pp. 96–97, 100.</ref> Meanwhile, in May 1969, guitarist and singer [[Steve Marriott]] left English band [[the Small Faces]].<ref name="Gray-22"/> [[Ron Wood]] replaced him as guitarist in June and on 18 October 1969, Stewart followed his friend and became the band's new singer.<ref name="Gray-22"/> The two joined existing members [[Ronnie Lane]], [[Ian McLagan]], and [[Kenney Jones]], who soon decided to call the new line-up [[Faces (band)|Faces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/06/arts/ronnie-lane-51-the-founder-of-small-faces-a-british-band.html|title=Ronnie Lane, the Founder Of Small Faces, a British Band|author=Jon Pareles|work=NY Times Archive|date=1997}}</ref>

''[[An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down]]'' became Stewart's first solo album in 1969 (it was known as ''The Rod Stewart Album'' in the US). It established the template for his solo sound: a heartfelt mixture of [[folk music|folk]], rock, and [[country blues]], inclusive of a British working-class sensibility, with both original material ("Cindy's Lament" and the title song) and cover versions ([[Ewan MacColl]]'s "[[Dirty Old Town]]" and [[Mike d'Abo]]'s "[[Handbags and Gladrags]]"). The backing band on the album included Wood, Waller and McLagan, plus [[Keith Emerson]] and guitarists [[Martin Pugh (musician)|Martin Pugh]] (of [[Steamhammer (band)|Steamhammer]], and later [[Armageddon (A&M band)|Armageddon]] and [[7th Order (band)|7th Order]]) and [[Martin Quittenton]] (also from [[Steamhammer (band)|Steamhammer]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-rod-stewart-album-rod-stewart/73413?ean=731455805826|title=Rod Stewart Album by Umvd Special Markets, Rod Stewart – 731455805826 – CD – Barnes & Noble|author=JohnQ|date=1 October 2010|work=Barnes & Noble}}</ref>

[[File:Rod Stewart (1971).png|thumb|upright|Stewart in a trade advert for his 1971 album ''[[Every Picture Tells A Story]]'']]
Faces released their debut album, ''[[First Step (Faces album)|First Step]]'', in early 1970 with a rock and roll style similar to the Rolling Stones. While the album did better in the UK than in the US, the Faces quickly earned a strong live following. Stewart released his second album, ''[[Gasoline Alley (album)|Gasoline Alley]]'' that autumn. Stewart's approach was similar to his first album and [[mandolin]] was introduced into the sound. He then launched a US tour with the Faces. Stewart sang guest vocals for the Australian group [[Python Lee Jackson]] on "[[In a Broken Dream]]", recorded in April 1969 but not released until 1970. His payment was a set of seat covers for his car. It was re-released in 1972 to become a worldwide hit.

Stewart's 1971 solo album ''[[Every Picture Tells a Story]]'' made him a household name when the B-side of his minor hit "[[Reason to Believe]]", "[[Maggie May]]", (co-written with Martin Quittenton) started to receive radio play. The album and the single occupied the number one chart position simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, a chart first, in September.<ref>Marcus, Greil. ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll.'' Second edition; Jim Miller, editor. New York: Random House, 1980, {{ISBN|0-394-51322-3}}, p. 379.</ref> ''Maggie May'' topped the single chart for five weeks in the US, and the UK and four weeks in Australia.  Set off by a striking mandolin part (by Ray Jackson of [[Lindisfarne (band)|Lindisfarne]]), "Maggie May" was also named in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s ''500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll''. The rest of the album was equally strong, with "[[Mandolin Wind]]" again showcasing that instrument; "[[(I Know) I'm Losing You]]" adding hard-edged soul to the mix; and "[[Tomorrow Is a Long Time]]", a cover of a [[Bob Dylan]] song. But the ultimate manifestation of the early Stewart solo style was the Stewart-Wood-penned "Every Picture Tells a Story" itself: powered by Mick Waller's drumming, [[Pete Sears]]'s piano and Wood's guitar work in a largely acoustic arrangement; it is a song relating to the [[picaresque]] adventures of the singer.<ref>{{Cite web |title=every picture tells a story - Record Collector Magazine |url=https://recordcollectormag.com/articles/every-picture-tells-a-story |access-date=2025-05-03 |language=en}}</ref>

The second Faces album, ''[[Long Player (album)|Long Player]]'', was released in early 1971 and enjoyed greater chart success than ''First Step''. Faces also got their only US Top 40 hit with "Stay With Me" from their third album ''[[A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse]]'' released in late 1971.<ref name="BillboardChart"/> This album reached the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic on the back of the success of ''Every Picture Tells A Story''.<ref name="BillboardChart"/><ref name="Roberts">Roberts, David (2006).

The Faces toured extensively in 1972 with growing tension in the band over Stewart's solo career enjoying more success than the band's. Stewart released ''[[Never a Dull Moment (Rod Stewart album)|Never a Dull Moment]]'' in the same year. Repeating the ''Every Picture'' formula, for the most part, it reached number two on the US album charts and number one in the UK,<ref name="RockHall"/> and enjoyed further good notices from reviewers. "You Wear It Well" was a hit single that reached number 13 in the US and went to number one in the UK, while "Twisting the Night Away" made explicit Stewart's debt to [[Sam Cooke]].

For the body of his early solo work Stewart earned tremendous critical praise. ''Rolling Stone'''s 1980 ''Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'' includes this in its Stewart entry:<ref name="rshist-377">Marcus, "Rod Stewart", in ''Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll'', p. 377.</ref>

<blockquote>Rarely has a singer had as full and unique a talent as Rod Stewart; rarely has anyone betrayed his talent so completely. Once the most compassionate presence in music, he has become a bilious self-parody – and sells more records than ever [... A] writer who offered profound lyricism and fabulous self-deprecating humour, teller of tall tales and honest heartbreaker, he had an unmatched eye for the tiny details around which lives turn, shatter, and reform [...] and a voice to make those details indelible. [... His solo albums] were defined by two special qualities: warmth, which was redemptive, and modesty, which was liberating. If ever any rocker chose the role of everyman and lived up to it, it was Rod Stewart.</blockquote>
[[File:Rod Stewart and Ron Wood - Faces - 1975.jpg|thumb|left|Stewart (right) while in [[Faces (band)|Faces]], with [[Ronnie Wood]] (left)]]
The Faces released their final album ''[[Ooh La La (Faces album)|Ooh La La]],'' which reached number one in the UK and number 21 in the US in 1973.<ref name="BillboardChart"/><ref name="Roberts"/> During the recording of the album, the rift between Stewart and the rest of the Faces grew further, as (according to [[Ian McLagan]]), Stewart did not participate until two weeks into the sessions, "and then complained that some songs were in the wrong key for him. So we recorded them again and waited a week for him to come back. We cut the track for 'Ooh La La' three times before he eventually passed on it, leaving it for [[Ronnie Wood|Woody]] to sing. [...] The week the album came out he did all he could to scuttle it and told anyone who would listen how useless it was."<ref name="mac-206">McLagan, Ian, ''All The Rage'' (2011), p. 206.</ref> The band toured Australasia, Japan, Europe and the UK in 1974<ref name="nzentgrafwoodworks">{{cite web|last=Zentgraf|first=Nico|title=Woodworks 1957–1975|url=http://www.nzentgraf.de/books/tcw/works1.htm|access-date=14 June 2008}}</ref> to support the album and the single "Pool Hall Richard".

In late 1974, Stewart released his ''[[Smiler (album)|Smiler]]'' album. In Britain, it reached number one, and the single "Farewell" number seven, but only number 13 on the ''Billboard'' pop album charts and the single "Mine for Me" only number 91 on the ''Billboard'' pop singles charts. It was his last original album for Mercury Records. After the release of the double album compilation ''The Best of Rod Stewart'' he switched to [[Warner Bros. Records]] and remained with them throughout the vast majority of his career (Faces were signed to Warner Bros., and Stewart's solo releases in the UK appeared on the Riva label until 1981). In 1975, Faces toured the US twice (with Ronnie Wood joining [[the Rolling Stones]]' US tour in between).<ref name="nzentgrafwoodworks"/> With Ronnie Wood having released his second solo album in 1975 and also having joined the Rolling Stones (first as a temporary replacement for the departing [[Mick Taylor]], and later as a permanent member), as well as Stewart's own burgeoning solo career, it became impossible to maintain the Faces as a viable band, so the Faces broke up at the end of the year.<ref name="tioos-chronicle75">{{cite web|last=McPherson|first=Ian|title=The Rolling Stones Chronicle: 1975|url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/chron1975.html|access-date=14 June 2008}}</ref>

===1975–1988: Height of fame and critical reaction===
[[File:Rod-Stewart.jpg|thumb|upright|On stage in [[Dublin]], 1981]]
In 1975, Stewart moved to Los Angeles; that year, he released the ''[[Atlantic Crossing]]'' album for his new record company, using producer [[Tom Dowd]] and a different sound based on the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]]. ''Atlantic Crossing'' marked both a return to form and a return to the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' album charts. The first single, a cover of the [[Sutherland Brothers]] song "[[Sailing (Sutherland Brothers song)|Sailing]]", was a number-one hit in the UK, charted high in other European countries and in Australia, but only reached the Top 60 of the US and Canadian charts. The single returned to the UK Top 10 a year later when used as the theme music for a BBC documentary [[Sailor (TV series)|series]] about {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}}. Having been a hit twice over, "Sailing" became, and remains, Stewart's biggest-selling single in the UK. His [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]] cover "[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)#Rod Stewart and Ronald Isley version|This Old Heart of Mine]]" was also a Top 100 hit in 1976.<ref name="BillboardChart"/> In 1976, Stewart covered [[the Beatles]]' song "[[Get Back]]" for the musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/all-this-and-world-war-ii-r230229/review|title=All This and World War II|website=AllMusic|access-date=4 December 2011}}</ref>

Later in 1976, Stewart topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for eight weeks and the Australian [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] chart with the ballad "[[Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)|Tonight's the Night]]", with an accompanying music video featuring actress [[Britt Ekland]].<ref name="BillboardChart"/> It came from the ''[[A Night on the Town (Rod Stewart album)|A Night on the Town]]'' album, which went to number two on the ''Billboard'' album charts and was Stewart's first album to go platinum. By explicitly marking the album as having a "fast side" and a "slow side", Stewart continued the trend started by ''Atlantic Crossing''. "[[The First Cut Is the Deepest]]", a cover of a [[Cat Stevens]] song, went number one in the UK in 1977, and top 30 in the US.<ref name="BillboardChart"/><ref name="RockHall"/> "[[The Killing of Georgie]] (Part 1 and 2)", about the murder of a gay man, was also a Top 40 hit for Stewart during 1977.<ref name="BillboardChart"/>

''[[Foot Loose & Fancy Free]]'' (1977) featured Stewart's own band, the original Rod Stewart Group that featured Carmine Appice, Phil Chen, Jim Cregan, Billy Peek, [[Gary Grainger]] and [[John Barlow Jarvis|John Jarvis]]. It continued Stewart's run of chart success, reaching number two. "[[You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)|You're in My Heart]]" was the hit single, reaching number four in the US.<ref name="BillboardChart"/>

"[[Hot Legs]]" achieved a lot of radio airplay as did the confessional "[[I Was Only Joking]]". In appearance, Stewart's look had evolved to include a [[glam rock|glam]] element, including make-up and spandex clothes. Stewart scored another UK number one and US number one single with "[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]", which was a crossover hit reaching number five on the ''Billboard'' black charts due to its [[disco]] sound.<ref name="BillboardChart"/> This was the lead single from 1978's ''[[Blondes Have More Fun]]'', which went to number one on the ''Billboard'' album charts and sold three million albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Rod+Stewart&ti=Blondes+Have+More+Fun|title=Recording Industry Association of America|website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] }}(RIAA)®</ref>

A focal point of criticisms about this period was his biggest-selling 1978 disco hit "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?", which was atypical of his earlier output, and disparaged by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t4062480|pure_url=yes}}|author=Mason, Stewart|title=Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?|website=AllMusic}}</ref> In interviews, Stewart, while admitting his accompanying look had become "tarty", has defended the lyrics by pointing out that the song is a [[third-person narrative]] slice-of-life portrayal, not unlike those in his earlier work, and that it is not about him. The song's refrain was identical to Brazilian [[Jorge Ben Jor]]'s earlier "Taj Mahal" and a lawsuit ensued. Stewart donated his royalties from "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" to [[UNICEF]], and he performed it with his band at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1979.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Stewart moved to a more [[New wave music|new wave]] direction in 1980 by releasing the album ''Foolish Behaviour''. The album produced one hit single, "[[Passion (Rod Stewart song)|Passion]]", which reached No. 5 on the US ''Billboard'' Charts. In August 1981, MTV was launched in the US with several of Stewart's videos in heavy rotation. Later in 1981, Stewart added further elements of new wave and [[synthpop]] to his sound for the ''[[Tonight I'm Yours]]'' album. The title song reached No. 20 in the US, while "[[Young Turks (song)|Young Turks]]" reached the Top 5 with the album going platinum.<ref name="BillboardChart"/> On 18 December 1981, Stewart played the Los Angeles Forum, along with [[Kim Carnes]] and [[Tina Turner]], in a concert broadcast worldwide via satellite.<ref>{{cite web |title=1981 – Rod Stewart's concert at the Los Angeles Forum is beamed |url=http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1981-rod-stewarts-concert-at-the-los-angeles-forum-is-beamed/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017202701/http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1981-rod-stewarts-concert-at-the-los-angeles-forum-is-beamed/ |url-status=usurped |archive-date=17 October 2017 |work=thisdayinrock.com |access-date=17 June 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Rod Stewart 86.jpg|thumb|upright|Stewart performing in Paris, 1986]]
Stewart was criticised by the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-apartheid movement]] for breaking a widely observed cultural boycott of [[apartheid]] South Africa by performing at the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort complex in Bophuthatswana as part of his [[Body Wishes]] (1983) and [[Camouflage (Rod Stewart album)|Camouflage]] (1984) tours.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/Elton-John-South-Africa-tour-jogs-memories-of-Sun--30061905.html | title= Elton John South Africa tour jogs memories of Sun City gigs | work= The Nation | date= 11 January 2008 | access-date= 6 August 2019 | url-status=dead | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131219073038/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/Elton-John-South-Africa-tour-jogs-memories-of-Sun--30061905.html | archive-date= 19 December 2013 }}</ref>

Stewart had four US Top 10 singles between 1982 and 1988; "Young Turks" (No. 5, carrying over from 1981 into 1982), "Some Guys Have All the Luck" (No. 10, 1984), "Infatuation" (No. 6, 1984) and "Love Touch" (No. 6, 1986, a Holly Knight/Mike Chapman collaboration). "[[Baby Jane (Rod Stewart song)|Baby Jane]]" reached No. 14 in 1983, but went to No. 1 in the UK, his final chart-topping single there to date.<ref name="BillboardChart"/> The corresponding ''[[Camouflage (Rod Stewart album)|Camouflage]]'' album went gold in the UK, and the single "Infatuation" (which featured his old friend Jeff Beck on the guitar) received considerable play on MTV. The second single "[[Some Guys Have All The Luck]]" reached No. 15 in the UK and No. 10 in the US.<ref name="BillboardChart"/>

A reunion with Jeff Beck produced a successful take on [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s "[[People Get Ready]]", but an attempt to tour together fell apart after a few dates. In the UK, "[[Every Beat of My Heart (Rod Stewart song)|Every Beat of My Heart]]" reached number two in 1986. In January 1985, Stewart performed to a large audience at the [[Rock in Rio]] festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Hundreds of thousands turn out for Rock in Rio festival |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110924-brazil-rock-rio-music-festival-draws-thousands-katy-perry-rihanna |access-date=17 June 2017 |work=france24.com |date=24 September 2011}}</ref>

===1988–1994: Out of Order Tour, ''Vagabond Heart'' and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame===
In 1988, Stewart returned with ''[[Out of Order (Rod Stewart album)|Out of Order]]'', produced by [[Duran Duran]]'s [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]] and by [[Bernard Edwards]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]]. "[[Lost in You (Rod Stewart song)|Lost in You]]", "[[Forever Young (Rod Stewart song)|Forever Young]]", "Crazy About Her", and "[[My Heart Can't Tell You No]]" from that album were all top 15 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and mainstream rock charts, with the latter even reaching the Top Five. "Forever Young" was an unconscious revision of [[Bob Dylan]]'s song of the same name; the artists reached an agreement about sharing royalties. The song reached No. 12 in the US.<ref name="BillboardChart">[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=rod stewart|chart=all}} Rod Stewart Album & Song Chart History]''Billboard'', 23 August 2011.</ref> In September 1988, Stewart performed "Forever Young" at the [[1988 MTV Video Music Awards]] at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] in Los Angeles, and in 1989 he received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance|Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]] for the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/rockmale.htm|title=Grammy Awards: Best Rock Vocal Performance – Male|access-date=26 April 2010|work=Rock on the Net}}</ref>

In January 1989, Stewart set out on the South American leg of the [[Out of Order Tour]] playing to sell-out audiences throughout Americas. There were 80,000 people at his show at Corregidora Stadium, [[Querétaro]], México (9 April), and 50,000 at Jalisco Stadium, [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]] (12 April). In [[Buenos Aires]], the audience at the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River Plate Stadium]], which seats 70,000+, was at over 90,000, with several thousand outside the stadium. Firehoses were sprayed on the crowd to avoid [[heat prostration]].{{citation needed|date=September 2025}}

Stewart's version of the [[Tom Waits]] song "[[Downtown Train]]" went to number three on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 1990.<ref name="BillboardChart" /> This song was taken from a four-CD compilation set called ''[[Storyteller – The Complete Anthology: 1964–1990]]''.

Released in 1991, the ''[[Vagabond Heart]]'' album continued Stewart's renewal and inspiration.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Don McLeese|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/vagabond-heart-19910516|title=Vagabond Heart &#124; Album Reviews|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=16 May 1991|access-date=23 April 2014}}</ref> The lead single, "[[It Takes Two (Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston song)|It Takes Two]]", with [[Tina Turner]], was released in 1990 in advance of the full album's release, and reached number five on the UK charts, but did not chart in the US. The follow-up songs from ''Vagabond Heart'' both reached the Billboard Hot 100 in 1991, with "[[Rhythm of My Heart]]" peaking at No. 5 and "[[The Motown Song]]" peaking at No. 10.<ref name="BillboardChart"/>

===1995–2001: New ventures and record labels===
[[File:Rod Stewart 1995.jpg|thumb|left|Stewart in Paris, 1995]]
By the early 1990s, Stewart had mostly abandoned creating his own material, saying that he was not a natural songwriter and that the tepid response to his recent efforts was not rewarding.<ref name="bbc122306">{{cite news|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193284.stm|work=BBC News|author=Young, Kevin|title=Stewart goes beneath the covers|date=23 December 2006|access-date=1 January 2007}}</ref> In 1995, Stewart released ''[[A Spanner in the Works]]'' containing a single written by [[Tom Petty]], "[[Leave Virginia Alone]]", which reached the Top 10 of the adult contemporary charts.

''[[When We Were the New Boys]]'', his final album on the [[Warner Bros.]] label released in 1998, contained versions of songs by [[Britpop]] acts such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Primal Scream]], and reached number two on the UK album charts.

Stewart is a [[model railway]] enthusiast.

A car collector, Stewart owns one of the 400 [[Ferrari Enzo]]s.
